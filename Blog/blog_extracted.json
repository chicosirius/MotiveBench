        "blog_text": "My mother-in-law was in town in September of 2000 and we were watching television one evening. The millionaire show was on and she asked me if I ever tried calling the toll-free number to be a contestant. This was about a year after the show debuted and nearly as long since I tried the number. I remembered they asked three trivia questions if you got through and recorded your answers but I wasn't good enough to get past those questions.   That night I tried the number again and to my surprise and delight I got through the three questions. It was all automated but the recording told me my name and information was now entered in a random drawing for the second round of qualifying. If I was chosen, they would call me at a number I supplied between 11am and 2pm the following day. I gave the computer my work phone and ate lunch at my desk the next day. No call came through for me. I tried once more that night. Again, I got all three trivia questions right and the next day I got a call from ABC. It was a real live person this time on the other end of the line. He asked me all sorts of eligibility questions and I passed because he gave me the secret toll-free number and PIN for round three. I was very excited. If I answered this series of questions correctly, I might be going to New York to tape the program.  Three days later at the appointed time I phoned in for the next round of questions. Back to the automation system this time with five questions instead of three. I got the first four right but missed the fifth question. Who was born first: Miles Davis or Perry Como? I said Davis but Como is actually older.  I came so close! I was more determined than ever to get back to the third round. Fast forward to November. Three months later and I was still trying everyday when the phone lines were open. They weren't open all the time. I made it back to round three in October but fared worse, missing two questions. So anyway, it's the weekend after Thanksgiving and once again I qualify for the third round. (I had qualified for round two six times total, with callbacks three times for round three).  The phone game is tricky because you have to put things in order. The question might be 'put these presidents in order of term, starting with the most recent and working backwards: 1)James Buchanan, 2) Jimmy Carter, 3) Woodrow Wilson, and 4) John Adams. So not only do you have to know the answer, you have to make the corresponding association to the order, rearrange them accordingly, and punch it in on your touch tone phone. So the answer to our question would be 2-3-1-4. You get the idea.  Three days later I took a pad and pen into a conference room, put the phone on speaker, and called the toll free number. Here were the questions. I had 10 seconds to answer each one.  Put these numbered song titles in order beginning with the smallest  1) 1999 2) 99 Red Balloons 3) Eight Days a Week 4) One is the loneliest number   Answer: 4-3-2-1  Put these historical events in the order they occurred, beginning with the earliest  1) Grand Canyon becomes National park 2) The NFL is formed 3) Glenn Miller dies in a plane crash 4) Hostage crisis in Iran  Answer: 1-3-2-4  Put these movie titles in order of release date, beginning with the earliest  1) roadtrip 2) thelma & louise 3) muppets take Manhattan 4) easy rider  Answer: 4-3-2-1  Put these people in order of their year of birth beginning with the most recent  1) Matt Lauer 2) Edward R. Murrow 3) Charles Kuralt 4) Joseph Pulitzer  Answer: 1-3-2-4  Put these islands in order moving east from the Hawaiian islands  1) Canary 2) Solomon 3) Philippines 4) West Indies  Answer: 4-1-2-3  I rocked the house going 5 for 5. Now all I needed was the callback. The recording said if I were chosen, I'd be called between 4pm and 7pm that day. I sat at my desk waiting. At 5pm there was no call, but that's no big deal. At 6pm still nothing and I'm starting to wonder. At 6:30, I'm still sitting at my desk at the office waiting and hoping and beginning to wonder what the heck it will take to make it.  Finally, at 6:35pm, I get the call. It's a producer from the show and after some more eligibility questions, they tell me I've been selected to appear as a finalist on the TV program. I had one week to prepare, but I had done it. I was going to New York to meet Regis and try to win One Million Dollars! The first order of business was to pick a companion to accompany me. If I got in the hot seat, this person would also appear on the show as I'm sure you know.  My wife Sue was my first choice but our son Skyler was only 18 months old and not ready for New York travel. My parents would keep him but my Mom was to be in Cape Girardeau with my Grandmother. So that effectively removed my Grandma, Wife, and Mom. So my Dad got tapped.  Pop became my secret weapon in this adventure. He's a psychologist by trade and recently he showed me a video tape of a new technique used by therapists in California called eye movement de-sensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). It's a simple but effective technique used to drain off excess anxiety in the brain by getting the brain hemispheres in sync. It's used primarily in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. It helps people come to terms with traumatic events of the past. It has a secondary use among people in anticipation of events, like a performance, to help quell stage fright.  We decide to use EMDR in anticipation of the millionaire event. I was worried about not being able to use the equipment effectively. They have some buttons on a panel that you use to punch in your answers for the fastest finger questions. So Dad and I used EMDR to explore that.   The network paid for the airplane tickets, hotel, and transportation, so all I needed to do was arrange for my phone-a-friend. Actually, they let you have five friends standing by and then based on the question that's giving you trouble, you pick which one to call. At the tip top of my list was a man named David Mehnert! David and I had caught up earlier that year when I saw his email address on one of those reunion websites (planetalumni.com, I think). He agreed to be available during the taping window and I supplemented my list with my wife, my sociology professor from DeVry, my ex-boss from Audio Reader in Lawrence, and a guy I worked with at my first I.T. job at Waddell and Reed. Everybody was set.  The buzz was starting to build at my work. I took three days of vacation to cover my trip. Everybody was very excited as word spread of my impending appointment with Regis. I'd overcome some terrific odds to make it this far. Now, I had a one in ten shot at getting to the money questions. I confidently told a co-worker that if I had no less than three chances to get in the hot seat, I would be there.  Finally, the day arrived and Pop and I headed to KCI. When I picked up the tickets at the counter, it sunk in for me. This was really happening. We arrived at LaGuardia airport at 1:30pm local time. We got an excellent view of Manhattan looking north as we swooped into the area on our TWA jet. John, from the car service, was waiting for us when we hit the terminal. A native New Yorker, John showed no fear navigating the always-heavy in-bound traffic. Our hotel, the Empire, at west 63rd and Broadway was a small, elegant eleven story building. The lobby was posh but the room was small and the bathroom even smaller. We settled in and I phoned my millionaire contact in residence at the hotel, Susan Vescera. A meeting to receive per-diem and get wardrobe approval was scheduled for 5:30pm. In the meantime, I phoned the associate producer at the show who was assigned to me, Brent, to inform him of my arrival. Dad took a nap.  I phoned two KU college friends, Alex Rappoport and Michael Bassin to see what they were doing for dinner. We agreed to meet at 'Joe's Shanghai' in Chinatown at 7:30pm. Brent phoned me back to conduct a pre-interview. In the event I made it into the hot seat, Regis needed notes about my personal life for the chat segments. Pre-interviews and notes were compiled for all contestants. Afterward, I read the almanac to kill some time before the 5:30 meeting. When I arrived at suite 1124 with show clothes in tow, I saw my competition for the first time. Nine other gentlemen of various shapes and sizes greeted me with varying degrees of good cheer. I adopted a cool demeanor. In time, I warmed up to all the other contestants.   All ten of us signed a release for our per-diem and were given 150 dollars in cash for our three days in the city. Packets were distributed with the complete rules and other release forms. We were instructed to be in the lobby the following day at 9:45am. A shuttle would transport the contestants and our companions to the ABC studios. We were instructed to dress casually and for warmth. The studio was kept at 65 degrees. We were to bring our approved show clothes along with us. Prior to the start of the show at 4pm, we would go to our dressing room for wardrobe, hair, and makeup. After the meeting, I took Dad back to the suite to get his brown jacket approved. It had a funky sharktooth pattern happening and I was afraid it might not be up to standards but it was deemed acceptable.  The cab ride to Chinatown took 30 minutes and nearly 13 dollars. We struggled through the theater district and Times Square. I spied the hotel where I stayed during my first visit to the city in 1974. The Edison Hotel at Times Square appeared to be going strong. It's famous for being the former home of band leader Ozzie Nelson in the 1930s. When we stayed there in the 70s, the aura of times square was quite different than it is today. There were strip clubs and porno houses everywhere. The Nelsons would have been ashamed. I was also happy to see the Howard Johnson's coffee shop where Granny and I ate breakfast on that same east coast bus tour. It was famous because Lilly Tomlin waited tables there in the 1960s. Now she has her name up in lights nearby for her award-winning one-woman show. In fact the lights at Times Square were impressive. Our cabby swung over to the east side, past Grand Central. A quick right turn at the United Nations building on F.D.R drive and we were on the fast track to the lower east side.  The restaurant in Chinatown was a dim sum place. You sat train-style at huge circular tables for ten people. By train-style I mean if your party was less than ten people, they seated strangers with you to fill up the extra space. My friend Alex appeared bearing gifts. He bestowed upon me a lucky charm of sorts, a pocket-sized laughing Buddha. The laughing Buddha is said to bring financial good luck. I carried this with me the next day. Later that evening in the hotel, I had trouble falling asleep. Imagine  that! I finally nodded off about 2am.  The ABC staff treated us well. They were nice through every phase of the experience. Even though the show taping would take two hours, we spent a full day at the studio. Once inside the complex, we could not take phone calls, go to the bathroom unescorted, or consult reference materials. We were in lock down to avoid any appearance of cheating.  We had a continental breakfast in the commissary and found out that our carry-over contestant was going for 500K at the start of our show. That was great news! There would be more time (and theoretically more chances) to get in the hot seat for the lot of us.  Our producer chatted with us again about background material and we went to the studio to rehearse. We practiced the introduction routine and all of us took turns sitting in the hot seat and using life-lines. We also got rapid-fire practice on the equipment with sample fastest-finger questions. I got the best time on the first four questions. Thanks Dad! (and EMDR). But the machinery was not idiot proof. It allowed you to punch in the same response more than once and if you held a key down, it repeated. It had a backspace key and a send key. It was the size of a X-Box controller, so most guys used their thumbs. My friend Chris Shanahan told me that he heard that the forefinger has a slightly faster response time than the thumb so I adopted that strategy.   We headed back to the green room and waited for makeup call. The makeup gal was so nice. All ten of us shared a dressing room and the mood was cheerful. Our carry over contestant regaled us with stories of the hot seat and his experience from the previous day.  We filed down to the studio where the crowd was waiting for us. They introduced us to applause, Regis appeared moments before the taping started, and away we went! Find out what happened.

        "blog_text": "You know, the one where I am at work all day on my own and no one to serve. I've done some work this morning to make up for the fact that I will in all probability not find the motivation to do any this afternoon. I don't understand how I can go for most of the day without interacting with anyone, and then when I go off to do some photocopying the phone starts ringing and the toner runs out on the copier at the same time. So I leave the photocopier half refilled with toner, with black crap all over my hands to run and answer the phone, and it has to be a bloody enquiry from an external organisation that I don't know the answer to, doesn't it? And on top of that I am out of breath from running and I sound like an incompetent idiot. So why did that need to happen? And why, when we finally decide to dispose of some dusty smelly old tomes in the library, does someone come in and ask to see them the very next week - everytime, without fail that happens. You can't tell me that is just chance.\n\nI was talking to Graham about fate and coincidence the other week. His motto in life used to be 'everything happens for a reason' but now he doesn't really believe that anymore. Up to a certain point I believe it. I think that the major events in our life are fated, but that the choices we make on our way there are our own free-will. I think that we are all put on this planet for some sort of purpose, that we're all part of some mega cosmic plan. The part we play may seem totally insignificant to us and we may never know that we've accomplished it. If there are only few major events in your life - birth, death, meeting of major players in accomplishing the set task and the set task itself - then there is an infinite amount of choice of what we do with the rest of our years, days and hours on earth. Well maybe not infinite, but enough choice to seem infinite - as infinite is just a concept anyway.\n\nThis is why I don't worry too much about the way my life is panning out. I just follow the path that seems right to my instincts and wait for things to happen to show me whether or not it was the right choice. I figure that fate will eventually take care of the big things in life, so long as I don't sit there passively waiting for it to happen, so long as I am following one course or another. Occasionally I get a calling from myself, saying that it's about time I did something - and when I'm set on what that something is then it usually plays into my hands by way of a lucky set of circumstances or coincidence - maybe not straight away, but eventually the situation I want to be in is made a reality and sometimes without me consciously trying.\n\nLike I wanted to go travelling so I did. I fell in love with Canada. I came back and had changed my views on my life and friends in Cheltenham and wanted a way out. I also wanted to meet new people and I craved the intimacy of a relationship that I hadn't had for so many years. I advertised for a date. It was answered by Graham who happened to live in Bristol, one of the places in the UK where I thought I might want to live, and who happened to love Canada too. We met, we fell in love. I needed a job and wanted to work in a library. A vacancy came up at Bristol Uni, I got not that job but a part time job in a different uni library - by all accounts a better library for my personal needs as regards the people who worked there and the working atmosphere. That led to a full time job in this library very quickly, which then quickly led on to a promotion (I am the youngest ever branch supervisor, and it is probably due to the fact that no one else applied for this position, when normally there are hundreds of applicants per job). I moved in with Graham. Meanwhile, after a brief flirtation with the idea of going to the US, Graham and I decided that we wanted to go to Canada to live. We couldn't apply as we didn't have enough points. We went to Vancouver, Graham fell in love with it, we got back, 5 months later the passmark goes down and we can apply.\n\nAt the moment the main thing calling me is Canada. In some way it lies in my future and I am yet to know why, but I don't question it - I will find out when I get there. My library work has served its purpose - I no longer want to do it, and when I move I doubt I will continue it, but it got me to Bristol and therefore got me to Graham. And I didn't know it at the time but being with Graham has made going to Canada possible. I believe that what happens in Canada will be related to a major event in my life - it might be my big task, or it might be my death, or both and Graham is one of the major players in my life, clearing the way.\n\nAll this because I refuse to believe that free-will doesn't exist, and I refuse to believe that coincidences happen for no reason. I think that the little coincidences like the old dusty books being disposed of then asked for are fairly meaningless - just fate's little way of reminding us that it is still in control of the world and that we shouldn't get too complacent, shouldn't slip into a way of life that is unquestioning and unaware of the world around us.\n\nEnd of discourse.",

        "blog_text": "It startles me, really, that the memory is so close to the surface.  I am so good about moving on, and not sentimental, not in that way.  But every time I walk on campus, through the vast empty space in front of Memorial Chapel, where the marching band practices in late August, I notice the sky.  This is Maryland, and so there are almost always clouds, gathering for the usual 5:00 thunderstorm.  Sometimes, though, the sky over me is impossibly clear and pristine.  I enjoy it for a split second.  And then my stomach turns, and my mind says 'I remember another day when the sky was so perfect and blue.'  Of course I know what I mean without actually saying it - that day was 9/11.  We were all so shocked that a massive tragedy could happen on such a beautiful day, as if the juxtaposition was just too cruel to bear.  9/11 changed the very character of the sky.   That day, well, my story is not unique.  I went to work, blew off the initial reports as 'some idiot in a Cessna,' but understood the magnitude of it in time to see the second tower fall on live TV in the conference room.  In how many offices, how many conference rooms, did the very same scene play out?  We were all so quiet.  My life was in Boston at that time, and like most major cities, all of the tall buildings downtown were quickly evacuated.  My building, only six stories, was not among them.  And so I remember watching from Allison's corner cubicle, as the streets filled with commuters, how odd it was to see them all heading home at once, in the middle of the day.  Some other things stick with me, too.  We had a number of women on staff who lived in Cambridge.  They decided to walk home, as they were scared to take the T.  Another co-worker cried hysterically, worried about a friend who worked in the towers (thankfully, he turned out to be fine).  We did get dismissed early, but my boss didn't go home.  'I live right down the street in a high-rise, so why bother?' she remarked, 'I'm no safer there than I am here.'  She had a point.  I remember worrying about her.  I also remember showing little emotion.    What I do not remember is any blue sky in the months following 9/11, though no doubt there were some good days.  The whole world seemed to be surrounded by a sort of darkness.  This wasn't, admittedly, just because of 9/11.  I was experiencing a bit of personal tragedy, too.  The horrible end of my horrible marriage had finally come.    What hell it was!  My ex-husband is a frightening, demanding, abusive, unstable man.  I was so afraid, so angry, during those months.  Why did I squander my youth with him?  Why wouldn't he just let me go?  Why did I end up with a lifetime of regrets by the time I was 24?  What great sin was I paying for?  I still don't have the answer to those questions.  And I still don't really understand why 9/11 happened, still don't really understand what it means.  A few days after 9/11, life was pretty much back to normal in Boston, at least externally.  We went back to work.  They were constructing a new building across the street from my office.  It's finished now, it was ready right on time.  Anyway, the construction workers had draped a huge American flag over the steel girders, the skeleton of this new structure, and I could see it perfectly from Allison's window.  I spent a lot of time staring at it, and thinking.  Against the perpetually gray sky, I saw sparks shooting out around the flag.  They were welding, no doubt.  But it looked like so much more, so beautiful, these white shimmers of light, small but so bold, fighting the hopelessness inside me, and around the world.  Americans were still building then, and we are still building now.  And I personally kept going, despite my ex. If America could go on, I sure as hell could, too.  Today I am much happier.  I cannot say the same about my country, really.  It is a daily exercise now, especially here on a university campus, to defend the U.S.  That's heartbreaking, sometimes.    But more often than not, we have gray skies here in Maryland.  And I can still see the sparks, the hope, the flag, the building, as though it were yesterday.  I know that even if the sight of a perfect sky is marred forever, we will always have this.",

        "blog_text": "Well, upon the matter of my leaving, its had nothing to do with you.  I'm just at a point in my life where everything I do is pointless (heh) and that I can't find the joy of stuff anymore.  I mean, I pick up a video game and ready to have fun and whatnot but all I do is press buttons randomly hoping for a good outcome.  I pick up my pencil read to do some math homework but all I get is confused by the buttons of the calculator.  I have the phone in my hand and I'm ready to call some of my friends but I just don't for some odd reason.  Maybe I should take a break.  I mean, there are a couple of things that I still like to do.  For instance, I still like to talk to you.  You're a cool guy, no matter what you say.  I still like to take walks (but since there's no one to walk with me, I seldom do).  I like to cook (but since I have not the time)  I dunno.  I don't have such an active social life as you think.  Its funny how your e-mail came to me today.  I thought I had an okay social life yesterday.  But after today, I just realized that I don't.  Well, not just today, I had a feeling that I wasn't the most socially active person for a long time now.  I found out that some of my friends are going to baseball games and concerts without ever once thinking of inviting me.  Even though all of my efforts in the past where to include everyone I could think of in my outings.  Yet, no one mentions a concert that I would like to attend.  No one would even think of asking me.  I think it has to do with an incident a couple of years ago when someone asked me to go to a concert and I made some lame excuse not to go because I didn't have the money back then and I never like to borrow money from my parents.  I made some lame excuse like, 'I don't like concerts' or something like that.  And I guess they still believe that and don't even bother to invite me to anymore.  Sometimes thinking about it, it almost makes me tear up.  Its not even something so superficial as going to a concert.  I just want to be talked to and invited to things like I invited other people to things.  And there are a couple of concerts that I would love to go to but no one would go with me because they're too busy doing other things.  Today was just mentally exhausting.  After having been slapped in the face by the fact that I was excluded from such trivial yet important things like concerts and baseball games, I get slapped in the face again for being average in every single thing I do.  I hate whining to people.  But this has just been bugging me.  I'm not the smartest person in the class.  I'm not the greatest violinist in the orchestra.  I wasn't the fastest soccer player.  I'm not the best of anything.  Just average or slightly above.  But whats worse is that sometimes I grow to hate the people who are better than me.  Maybe not hate, but feel intensely jealous.  And that really sucks because thats a bad feeling.  Then I connect the state of being average to my problem with not being invited to places.  Then I think that maybe because of me being just a regular person that no one really takes notice of me enough to take me places.   I don't think I've had arguements with my friends.  But I can just never have a good conversation with them anymore.  Its not their fault but whenver I talk to them, they'll tell me about the stuff they do all the time.  Like how they need a new drum set because their band is doing a gig at some place.  Or how this person went to a tri-county whatnot with their orchestra.  I mean, I feel happy for them and stuff but I just feel left out.  Why can't I be in those things?  Oh wait, I know, because I'm insanely average.  Fuck.  Its not like I want to keep things from you.  So far, I've been honest and open.  I wouldn't decline any question directed towards me.  I don't think you're going to molest me (nerds aren't strong, right?)  Just kidding.  I'm just over-thinking things and being anal about everything (for a lack of a better phrase).  Popularity escapes my grasp, but yet it is so close that I can touch it sometimes.  It'll be cool to meet sometime.  It wouldn't be bad because we could meet again some other time after the initial meet.  I mean, its not like right after our meeting one of us will go off into war and never been heard from again.  I know that our meeting will not be bad because I know that we will continue to talk again.  Even if not through chat, then through e-mail.  I once had a penpal (online penpal) from Germany.  This nice girl about my age when I was about 13 or 14 years old.  We used to exchange e-mail letters everyday without fail.  She was so human.  She had flaws and she had strengths.  We had so many conversations and I learned so much stuff about Germany.  German word and phrases and foods.  But at the end of our time exchanging e-mail, something happened to her.  She was sent to the hospital for some sort of testing.  And I never really heard from her again.  I felt so bad and lonely.  You know?  All this time, two years or so, we spent e-mailing each other, and for her to just cut off so suddenly without a goodbye or anything, it just broke me.  And to think it, we never even chatted real time.  There was no IM'ing.  But it just ruined me.    The moral.  Well, not really a moral.  More of a transitition to this paragraph.  Matt.  If we are to continue talking, then you should some sort of promise or pact or whatever that you won't disappear to Japan without a goodbye or if not a goodbye then a pact/promise/whatever that you'll still continue writing.  The little girl in Germany managed to write to the little boy in America.  You could do the same in Japan.  I don't know what the future holds and I don't expect that much from the future.  Maybe we will meet.  And maybe not.  I sure hope we do.  I like to meet the person who is responsible for keeping me from so many assignements, papers, projects, and masturbation sessions.  Yea, too much information, I know.  The last one was for ha'ha's.  Anyway.  I'm going to Tahiti no matter what.  Its your choice whether or not you want to come with me.  The end.  Dennis.",

I've just always felt that my brain is actually capable of insanity, that one day I'll just completely lose it, completely lose the ability to hold it all together. I'm not trying to be my usual attention seeking overly dramatic self here but this is seriously what I've always thought, and I think the moment has arrived.  I've noticed that especially in the last 12 months I've been drifting further and further away from reality. This used to be because I had nothing to do, and thus nothing to focus on. And that extremely brief stint that I did working full time kind of helped because it gave me some kind of false sense of worth. I convinced myself that by getting up at 5am and mixing paint for Tradies til 6pm I was actually servicing my community, I was actually giving back to the society that had supposedly given me so much. I've since convinced myself that this is a load of shit. Everybody is convinced that working is the right, good and honest thing to do with your life.

        "blog_text": "In honor of Beah Richards. I watched 'Beah Richards: A black woman speaks' by Lisa Gay Hamilton (my girl from the practice!) I surfed forever just to find this poem i'm still working on the peice where she says 'I could make the seven wonders....wonder'. I'll keep ya updated.  A Black Woman Speaks. . .  Of White Womanhood Of White Supremacy Of Peace It is right that I a woman black, should speak of white womanhood. My fathers my brothers my husbands my sons die for it; because of it. And their blood chilled in electric chairs, stopped by hangman's noose, cooked by lynch mobs' fire, spilled by white supremacist mad desire to kill for profit, gives me that right.  I would that I could speak of white womanhood as it will and should be when it stands tall in full equality. But then, womanhood will be womanhood void of color and of class, and all necessity for my speaking thus will be past. Gladly past.  But now, since 'tis deemed a thing apart supreme, I must in searching honesty report how it seems to me. White womanhood stands in bloodied skirt and willing slavery reaching out adulterous hand killing mine and crushing me. What then is this superior thing that in order to be sustained must needs feed upon my flesh? How came this horror to be? Let's look to history.  They said, the white supremacist said that you were better than me, that your fair brow should never know the sweat of slavery. They lied. White womanhood too is enslaved, the difference is degree.  They brought me here in chains. They brought you here willing slaves to man. You, shiploads of women each filled with hope that she might win with ruby lip and saucy curl and bright and flashing eye him to wife who had the largest tender. Remember? And they sold you here even as they sold me. My sisters, there is no room for mockery. If they counted my teeth they did appraise your thigh and sold you to the highest bidder the same as I.  And you did not fight for your right to choose whom you would wed but for whatever bartered price that was the legal tender you were sold to a stranger's bed in a stranger land remember? And you did not fight. Mind you, I speak not mockingly but I fought for freedom, I'm fighting now for our unity. We are women all, and what wrongs you murders me and eventually marks your grave so we share a mutual death at the hand of tyranny.  They trapped me with the chain and gun. They trapped you with lying tongue. For, 'less you see that fault— that male villainy that robbed you of name, voice and authority, that murderous greed that wasted you and me, he, the white supremacist, fixed your minds with poisonous thought: 'white skin is supreme.' and therewith bought that monstrous change exiling you to things. Changed all that nature had ill you wrought of gentle usefulness, abolishing your spring. Tore out your heart, set your good apart from all that you could say, think, feel, know to be right. And you did not fight, but set your minds fast on my slavery the better to endure your own.  'Tis true my pearls were beads of sweat wrung from weary bodies' pain, instead of rings upon my hands I wore swollen, bursting veins. My ornaments were the wip-lash's scar my diamond, perhaps, a tear. Instead of paint and powder on my face I wore a solid mask of fear to see my blood so spilled. And you, women seeing spoke no protest but cuddled down in your pink slavery and thought somehow my wasted blood confirmed your superiority.  Because your necklace was of gold you did not notice that it throttled speech. Because diamond rings bedecked your hands you did not regret their dictated idleness. Nor could you see that the platinum bracelets which graced your wrists were chains binding you fast to economic slavery. And though you claimed your husband's name still could not command his fidelity.  You bore him sons. I bore him sons. No, not willingly. He purchased you. He raped me, I fought! But you fought neither for yourselves nor me. Sat trapped in your superiority and spoke no reproach. Consoled your outrage with an added diamond brooch. Oh, God, how great is a woman's fear who for a stone, a cold, cold stone would not defend honor, love or dignity!  You bore the damning mockery of your marriage and heaped your hate on me, a woman too, a slave more so. And when your husband disowned his seed that was my son and sold him apart from me you felt avenged. Understand: I was not your enemy in this, I was not the source of your distress. I was your friend, I fought. But you would not help me fight thinking you helped only me. Your deceived eyes seeing only my slavery aided your own decay. Yes, they condemned me to death and they condemned you to decay. Your heart whisked away, consumed in hate, used up in idleness playing yet the lady's part estranged to vanity. It is justice to you to say your fear equalled your tyranny.  You were afraid to nurse your young lest fallen breast offend your master's sight and he should flee to firmer loveliness. And so you passed them, your children, on to me. Flesh that was your flesh and blood that was your blood drank the sustenance of life from me. And as I gave suckle I knew I nursed my own child's enemy. I could have lied, told you your child was fed till it was dead of hunger. But I could not find the heart to kill orphaned innocence. For as it fed, it smiled and burped and gurgled with content and as for color knew no difference. Yes, in that first while I kept your sons and daughters alive.  But when they grew strong in blood and bone that was of my milk you taught them to hate me. Put your decay in their hearts and upon their lips so that strength that was of myself turned and spat upon me, despoiled my daughters, and killed my sons. You know I speak true. Though this is not true for all of you.  When I bestirred myself for freedom and brave Harriet led the way some of you found heart and played a part in aiding my escape. And when I made my big push for freedom your sons fought at my sons' side, Your husbands and brothers too fell in that battle when Crispus Attucks died. It's unfortunate that you acted not in the way of justice but to preserve the Union and for dear sweet pity's sake; Else how came it to be with me as it is today? You abhorred slavery yet loathed equality.  I would that the poor among you could have seen through the scheme and joined hands with me. Then, we being the majority, could long ago have rescued our wasted lives. But no. The rich, becoming richer, could be content while yet the poor had only the pretense of superiority and sought through murderous brutality to convince themselves that what was false was true.  So with KKK and fiery cross and bloodied appetites set about to prove that 'white is right' forgetting their poverty. Thus the white supremacist used your skins to perpetuate slavery. And woe to me. Woe to Willie McGee. Woe to the seven men of Martinsville. And woe to you. It was no mistake that your naked body on an Esquire calendar announced the date, May Eighth. This is your fate if you do not wake to fight. They will use your naked bodies to sell their wares though it be hate, Coca Cola or rape.  When a white mother disdained to teach her children this doctrine of hate, but taught them instead of peace and respect for all men's dignity the courts of law did legislate that they be taken from her and sent to another state. To make a Troy Hawkins of the little girl and a killer of the little boy!  No, it was not for the womanhood of this mother that Willie McGee died but for a depraved, enslaved, adulterous woman whose lustful demands denied, lied and killed what she could not possess. Only three months before another such woman lied and seven black men shuddered and gave up their lives. These women were upheld in these bloody deeds by the president of this nation, thus putting the official seal on the fate of white womanhood within these United States. This is what they plan for you. This is the depravity they would reduce you to. Death for me and worse than death for you.  What will you do? Will you fight with me? White supremacy is your enemy and mine. So be careful when you talk with me. Remind me not of my slavery, I know it well but rather tell me of your own. Remember, you have never known me. You've been busy seeing me as white supremacist would have me be, and I will be myself. Free! My aim is full equality. I would usurp their plan! Justice peace and plenty for every man, woman and child who walks the earth. This is my fight!  If you will fight with me then take my hand and the hand of Rosa Ingram, and Rosalee McGee, and as we set about our plan let our wholehearted fight be: PEACE IN A WORLD WHERE THERE IS EQUALITY.  —Beulah Richardson 1951",

But somehow my downward spiral to the bottom of my emotional barrel showed me that I can go up, that if I want to keep living, I have no CHOICE but to go up.  And my intellectual side has made that upward journey a lot easier.  It's wonderful when you start to transform your pain and anger into joy.  It's not always easy, but damn it feels good when you get there.  I may not be able to do it every day, but I'm getting better and better the more I practice.  And it makes appreciating the simple yet immense joys of life and love so much easier and necessary.  I spend a good portion of my day in a state of humility and gratitude for my past pains, because I honestly believe that I would not know the joy I know today without them.    And having been to the bottom and back, when you come out on the other side, suddenly your priorities are so much more clear.  Losing everything emotionally helps you so much to realize what's truly important to you, if you allow yourself to reflect on the loss with more of a sense of evaluation and new perspective than in anger and resentment for having had to lose everything in the first place.  I slip sometimes, especially when I'm hormonal, so that's why I continue to go to therapy...because it keeps me in check about what's really important, especially when I start to fret about silly incidental things like my weight and my daily stress at work, things that at first seem overwhelming, but, in the big picture, are nearly meaningless.  The truly important things in my life seem to have a way of working themselves out.    I don't know if I came even remotely close to answering your question, but these are the thoughts that came out of my head when I read your post, so I hope you enjoy them.",

But in truth I only meant that I disliked it. And never though, had I thought that I actually feel so strongly towards another, one who I despise so greatly that I have often thought of snapping and beating the shit out of him.

        "blog_text": "Mosquitoes have four life cycles: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Do not be mistaken. I am not trying to educate you about the life cycle of mosquitoes. But, I just want to ask you a simple question:  Is the life cycle of a human being similar to that of a mosquito?      Yes. We are certainly not breathing through an air tube and obviously don't fly. But, the life cycle of a mosquito and a human is essentially the same, at least to me. To begin with, it starts with birth and ends with death. But, the most striking resemblence is the quality of change in a predictable pattern. Let me illustrate the point to you. The story begins when you are born into this strange and foreign world, to a couple of 'nice' people we call parents. We grow and learn to adapt quickly in this mysterious world with several unanswered questions. We intergrate into society and start to socialise with our peers in kindergarden, primary, secondary, tertiary education and finally working life. These experiences change the world we view the world and the way we behave. We get married when we find the 'person of our dreams', give birth to a few kids and work hard for our family. Finally, we retire and settle into a life of seclusion and wait for moment when we see no light. Sounds familiar?  A Japanese proverb says, ' The nail that sticks out will be hammered down .' Society tries to place many rules on us as individuals as to what is acceptable and what is not. We must decide for ourselves whether to conform to such a social decorum. We are taught as soon as we are old enough to grasp the idea that it is bad to be unique and to avoid being different. At some point, however, we must decide within ourselves whether to spend every day trying to be like everyone else because society says we should or living each day  true  to ourselves.  Our strength as a person is proven through what we decide . E. E. Cummings once said, 'To be nobody but yourself - in a world which is doing it's best night and day to make you like everyone else - means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight, and never stop fighting.' The benefits of being true to ourselves greatly outweigh any negative aspects of choosing that path.   One of the most obvious advantages of being true to ourselves is that people will see us, perhaps for the first time, without a mask. People will see what we are really like on the inside. They will see our talents, imperfections, and preferences. Then they will have the opportunity to accept us on our own terms. As we work to show our true selves to society, we may discover things about ourselves we did not already know. We all have God-given talents of which we may or may not be aware. After we stop hiding whom we truly are, our talents will have the opportunity to come to the fore. However, at the same time, we are also fearful to expose our weakness and that is why few do so.  Second,  society teaches us to conform by not thinking for ourselves . We are simply told how to solve a problem or accomplish a task. We are never taught why or how something works. If we do not attempt to break out of that mold, we will never get to the point where we wonder why or how things work. A young child constantly asks 'Why?' He has yet to realize that it does not matter, according to teachers and leaders of society, why the sky is blue. It only matters that it is blue. Perhaps there is an underlying fear that if we begin to question innocent things like the color of the sky we will one day begin to question government policies, etc. Then we might discover that many 'great leaders' in this world have convinced us to believe their version of the truth. But, in my personal opinion,  THAT DAY  is not coming any day soon.",

Dad had picked me up from college and we'd had a nice chat on the drive home.  It was a cold, crisp day, so we were surprised to see Mom standing in the driveway without her coat when we pulled up.  As we got closer, we realized she was sobbing.  A month earlier, she'd had a mastectomy, and she was in the beginning of many rounds of chemotherapy for her breast cancer, so I assumed she'd gotten horrible news about a biopsy or something.  I raced to her to hug her, and through her sobs, all she could utter was, 'Miriam's plane went down.'  Miriam was a friend of mine who had just finished a semester in London under the auspices of Syracuse University.  I'd been out to visit her for a week over Thanksgiving, and we'd had an awesome time touring museums, seeing shows and exploring the city together.  I hadn't realized she was flying home that day, and I was surprised to find out Mom knew not only her flying schedule but the plane she was on.  We went inside and turned on CNN -- which was in its infancy -- to watch the first grainy images of the wreckage of Pan Am flight 103, which had just hours earlier come crashing down in fiery pieces over Lockerbie, Scotland.  And over the next few weeks and months as the evidence pointing to a terrorist bomb emerged in the media, I numbly started experiencing the bizarre dichotomy of a personal tragedy playing itself out on the world stage.    In the years since, I've befriended Miriam's parents and friends, and I've written many pieces about my perspective on the bombing that were published in newspapers and scholarly journals and read on NPR.  And I've found myself at times emotionally hardened against horrible tragedies and at other times bursting into tears over Kodak commercials.  It continues to be an emotional ride, but I've gradually stopped treating the anniversary of Miriam's murder with solemn reverence.  In fact, I spent six hours today unpacking and organizing my new office in our cool new downtown building.  Then I spent the evening folding, stuffing and stamping 200 Christmas letters.  And for the first time since the bombing, I didn't call or email Miriam's family on the anniversary.  I didn't even watch the news for any special 15-years-ago-today coverage.   Am I forgetting her?  Am I 'moving on'?  Am I growing callous?  There still isn't a week that goes by where I don't think about her repeatedly, so I'm pretty sure I'm not letting her memory fade -- but I've grown comfortable enough with the loss that I'm clearly not overcome by it every year on the winter solstice.  And I guess I'm OK with that.",

Theres so much to do, I hardly get any sleep, theres always something more, and everyones stressed constantly. AND THEN. As if thats not enough for Satan to use to screw me up and draw me away from God, hes gotta actually do more. And then he goes and attacks me somehow, whether its through something at home or a relationship or work or school or whatever. But I dont even have the time or energy or the strength to fight back! When I need to be on my knees most is when I cant.   Its just not fair! He hits when were down. Its low. Its sneaky. Its Satan. I just dont know what to do now. Its just that theres this one thing on top of everything else thats unavoidable, that one thing that my mind focuses on instead of the other stressful stuff, but honestly is, in itself, stressful stuff. And if Im not being rendered useless enough by finals etc., there has to be more on top of it.   So, to make a long story short Do I give up? No, thats the point. No matter how much I submit and give up and know Gods will and want Gods will and strive for that in all my actions and being, my heart still wants the other. Why cant they line up? Why cant my desires go away or die or whatever? I dont get it!   Maybe its all Gods safety net. Its the desire that keeps me in submission to God. So is God torturing me with this predicament because He wants to keep me in submission? Thats not my Jesus. Hes using my desires for His glory, yes. But I give them up and they just come back to me. And Ive asked God, does that mean I get to keep them? No answer. But status quo. Its the thorn in my flesh.   It goes back to this  Satan is a big jerk. Pauls thorn in his flesh kept him in submission, kept him focused and humble. Mines just making me frustrated. And how do I live for today? In submission.   Its this constant battle we live in, between the desires of the flesh and the willingness of the spirit to obey. Many times the flesh wins out, and we act upon our desires. Its called sin. But there are many times when the spirit is obeyed. Just because we are not in sin does not mean, however, that the sinful fleshs desires are gone. We can be in complete submission to the will of God with our actions, and the wants of the human nature are still there. Submission does not take those away.   Submission is not just actions, though. We are called to submit everything, to His authority. Everything is under the authority of Jesus Christ. This means not only actions but desires and thoughts and dreams and feelings and everything else.   And submission is not just a one-time event, but a continuing process. It must be done over and over and over again. We live life minute by minute, and so also must submission take place.   Submission is an interesting thing. I had submitted my will to God before, in the sense that I knew what He wanted me to do and so I gave up my plans and took on His. He then filled in all the necessary details, like motivation and talents and passions. And I suppose on a smaller scale I submit to God every day when I am obedient to His commands.   But this summer, I learned a deeper meaning of submission. I am sure that I do not know the breadth of submission, but I have felt the depth. Submission involves a lot more than just knowing Gods will and doing it. You dont have to know what God wants of you in order to submit. You just have to trust Him. Know that His plan is better than yours will ever be. Believe that He will take care of you, that He will honor your sacrifice, and that He will do something wonderful with it. Trusting Him is a hard one. Even harder is trusting the other people involved.   I learned that it was a lot easier to submit to God when I knew the other people in the situation were living lives in obedience to His will, that they would listen to Him. But when I didnt trust others to be living that kind of life, it was harder to submit. Its not that I didnt trust God. But in a sense, I didnt. I trusted Him to work through people who were obedient to Him, but I was unable to grasp that He could work through people who werent. That takes a lot of trust!   Another thing about submission is that it is hard. I didnt want to. I knew what I had to do, what I was called to do, and I just held on to my desires and my dreams anyway. The amazing thing about God is that when we do something out of obedience, even if we dont want to, He honors that. Yes, He cares about our motivation and He wants us to willingly obey Him. But He honors our obedience even when were not willing.   Submission can be a kind of test. There are some things that we have to give up just so that well get them back again. There are some things that we have to give up so that they can be purified before God returns them to us. There are some things we have to give up that we will never get back. Its a test of our faith, our trust in God.   The funny thing about submission is that we know all about it. We hear about it in church, we read passages in the Bible about it, we know the stories of people whove done it. But we so rarely experience it ourselves. We do not know what submission is, on a personal level. Intellectually, we understand. But in our hearts, we do not.   Without actually going through the process of submission, we cannot know the amazing response within us. It is a feeling of freedom, and of peace. We now know deep within us that God is truly in control. He always was, but we are able to truly acknowledge it within the depths of our hearts. We dont have to pretend like we are in control any more. We are no longer responsible for what happens. God is in charge. We are free to continue living life, being obedient to Him. There is peace, knowing His will is perfect and is what is best, for us and for His glory.   And yet I come back to the point that submission cannot be everything. I can be in complete and total submission, but I will still be human. My human nature, my desires and wants and wills and dreams, will be in constant conflict with the spirit of Christ within me. This is irreconcilable! There is a constant battle going on, between the flesh and the spirit. The Bible talks about this over and over again.   So where does this leave us? At the point of grace. Flesh and spirit will always fight, and the spirit will not always win. There will always be sin in the believers life; we cannot escape our human nature. God knows this. He desires us to be perfect, true, and we should always strive for this. But there is a wonderful thing called grace for when we fail. My sins do not come between me and God because of His grace. Because of His justice, there had to be an atonement made for all my sins. But because of His grace and His love, He sent His Son Jesus Christ to die and be that atonement. I do not have to die because of my sin. I can have heaven because of Jesus. That is grace.",

        "blog_text": "I thought I only wanted to read tonight.  But as I sat down on the leather recliner with my book, I yearned for something to add to the experience.  I need to speak of what Im connecting with.  This book this book is coming through me with as much knowing as I can imagine.  Theres this true and powerful identification occurring inside, connecting with the authors characterization of ms. Woolf.  I feel my own inner world being described.  A sense of unity with this woman, this writer immersed in the out-of-body experience of creation.    I know I am a writer.  It is my calling, my passion, the space where I feel most satisfied.  Like my talents as a soccer player, I slip into this zone of being.  I dont just play the game, I am the game.  I lose myself, create plays, defy my own expectations of my skill.  I become the game, wholly and without doubt.  I feel this way when I write.  I write because I have to.  As much as I require to eat and breath and lust for sex, I must write to complete my world.  I am at peace before the computer, thinking without effort as my fingers move without conscious intention about the keyboard.  Its more than an extension of me.  It is me.  The pragmatist interrupts here for a moment.  There will come a time when I will need to parlay this into making a living for myself.  I have no designs to marry well, to afford myself the luxury of being supported financially by another.  I have rich parents.  This is essential at this stage of my life.  But this cannot last.  I need to pull free of the bonds of financial dependence.  I need this to further my capacity to write, not just for my emotional development.  This kind of writing this confessional brand of writing this is my comfort zone.  Not fiction, not analytical essays.  Although I can manage alright within the spheres of both.  No where does this flavour of writing enter into the capitalist scheme?  How can I transcribe my words into marketable fodder?  To be financially dubious means a risk to my life alone.  I need this space apart from human interruption.  I wont always have this place of my own, safely isolated from disturbance and all the risks associated with interpersonal interaction.  Not unless I buy this place from my folks.  And thats going to take some pragmatic doing.  I want for my aunt to read this book.  Paula go buy Cunninghams novel, The Hours.  It won the Pulitzer for a reason.  Its remarkably written, so acutely insightful into the minds of three women living at different times but with paralleling complications due to their respective social limitations.  They embody shades of the same woman, transcendent of historical timelines.  Its brilliant, and Im only 40 pages into it.  Where are we going, Walt Whitman?  The Clash is singing Lost in a Supermarket on the stereo downstairs, and Im reminded of the pensive poem of Alan Ginsberg.  Im always thinking of that poem.  For years, it comes into my head on a weekly basis.  Something will trigger it.  Like this book, it speaks for me.  I roll it around in my mouth, attentive to the flavour it releases.  This space I find myself in this evening.  Before the medication, I would be manic with it.  The sheer energy of transcendent connection would envelop me, swallow me whole, drown me in emotion too powerful for my single self to contain.  But instead instead I can be with it, experience it and honour it.  Its not going to destroy me.  this night like so many before it and so many more to come this is being alive.  The extremes are not frightening, that threat promised when an undertow would present itself.  An undertow to take me deep into depression or the flip side when I would feel unable to stop the mania overtaking me.  where exalted transcendence would separate me from myself.  Either way, the break from reality the uncontrolled push and pull by invisible forces.  Eleven pills a day.  Somehow the chemical assistance thank god Ive found some balance.  And further, that I can still find the zone without the terrifying abandon to strange energies.  Mm plays dark, complicated beats downstairs.  The music is inside of me tonight.  With each selection picked at random by my player, I shift shapes into nostalgic reverie or dampened weight.  The aperture of the soul is cranked wide open tonight, inviting all that presents itself an unadulterated opportunity to affect me.  But its safe.  There is no one here to threaten the indulgence of feeling.  There is no doom on the horizon to cause me worry that the darkness will disguise my better judgment.  No super-caliber light to blind my ocular connection to the ground beneath me.    Talking about mental illness is difficult if youre not in my body, I imagine.  Do I do it justice to try to describe it?  Ive only recently begun to acknowledge that an illness haunts me.   Ive always been a bit off.  Thought it idiosyncratic or eccentric but never a bonefide chemical imbalance.  Then again, with all the narcotics Ive used in my time they warn you of the potential to bring a susceptibility to the surface when you abuse hard drugs.  Did I bring this on myself?  Or did I use them to deal with the disease before I recognized what it is?  Crystal gave me consistency of feeling.  I knew exactly the trajectory of the high as measured by my intake.  I knew exactly how hard Id fall when all the elation evaporated.  Marijuana was a godsend the way it balanced me into a state of continual paranoia and paralysis.  I invented my own bubble of anxiety to live in.  Now its just alcohol.  My mistress.  Kept in the cupboard for days, and then she emerges full of light and life.  A promise of abandon from my better judgment.  An allowance of moral freedom.  A vacation from my path, is what it is.  Kept in check, its harmless.  So long I continue to realize the larger compromises accepted by indulging in it.  Neko is on the stereo now downstairs.  I think its time to disengage the writer and engage the base animal lust for impassioned song.",

        "blog_text": "It's good to have friends.   I think this  and  this  about sums it up. It is hard having to leave everything behind. On Friday I could still hold it back a bit, until after watching  Lilo & Stitch . I just broke out crying in Carol's arms. And Saturday all I could think of during the graduation ceremony was how I wanted to see all my friends again. Dinner was good, and I got along well with my family (for a change), but... After tomorrow morning I won't be able to see my friends for a long time. Well, I'm getting ahead of myself there. Anyway, once dinner was over I scooted over to Tracy & Jeff's, since they were having their gaming night. To hell with packing, friends are more important. They were having a good time, which made me happy. And after everyone else left, I just couldn't bring it over myself to leave. I just wanted to stay there forever, with all the people that helped me get through the semester in one piece. I am not exaggerating when I say that I wouldn't have made it without them. After (heck, even while) all the shit had hit the fan this past Summer I was about to give up on myself. The one thing that kept me going was the knowledge that there was someone to return to. If not... If not I would have just withered away. So I was there for a long while, but with each minute I became more restless. My feet were tingling, and my stomach was turning circles. Because every minute that passed was a minute closer to good-bye, and I didn't want that. I  hate  good-byes. I really wanted time to stop right there and then. I really did. And all the time I kept thinking if there wasn't anything I could have done to stay a while longer. What if I had told my parents all of a sudden that I didn't want to go to Waterloo anymore? But I knew that I couldn't have done that. Because I would have caused more harm than the one I was avoiding, and I would have been selfish. I am my own bane. And I knew I couldn't avoid my curse. I cannot stay anywhere for long after making friends. Something will always drag me away kicking and screaming. I am destined to remain a memory only. But I am fighting it with every ounce of strength in me. I will see these friends again, even if I have to drag all of Canada behind me to do it. I will...I will... I will be back.  It pained me a lot to have to leave these friends. A  lot . And again it was up to me to be the bastard and be the one that forced in the departure. I almost didn't though. When I went down the stairs my feet felt like lead, and when I was leaving the building I nearly turned around. But... But I am a coward. I couldn't face them anymore. I wouldn't have been able to go on being a bastard. Step after step I dragged myself to the car and drove back to my apartment, and cried myself to sleep. Hah! How true that song sounds right now...   ...  And when I laugh it's tears I hide And when I cry it's joy inside A foul disease has stained the land The bitter harvest of a dying bloom And when I cry it's joy inside A wicked smile for all the tears I hide It hurts to hold all the pain I feel The bitter harvest of a dying bloom  ...   *sigh* Saturday was both the happiest and the saddest day in my life. And all I can think of now is  O'Hana means family. Family means no one gets left behind, or forgotten . Nobody. Nobody will be forgotten by me. They will forever have my heart and soul.  Tomorrow morning I'm leaving for Canada. This is it. I'm gone. I... I don't know what to do. After this, how can I make new friends? How can I face my life and the prospects of yet another good-bye? They say it's a small world... But how come that it feels like the distances separating us are infinite? That it would take an eternity to see them again? If this is such a small world, then why can't I stay with those I love most? I promised that on the first opportunity I get to visit I would be there with them, and I plan to keep that promise. But... But what if I'm forbidden from having such an opportunity for two years?  WHY THE FUCK  can't I get back for two years after my studies are over?  WHICH ASSHAT  decided to put that clause in a student visa? Xenophobic fucktards. I don't want money, I don't want power, I don't want control... I just want my friends back. I want to be happy, and I want them to be happy. Is that too much to ask for?",

        "blog_text": "I recieved this recently, and found it quite thought provoking.  It's quite long....but worth the read and laugh.  Oh the logics of American Politics...  Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq? A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction honey Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction A: That's because they Iraqis were hiding them. Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq? A: Yup. Invasions always work better than inspections Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons of mass destruction, did we? A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden.  Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election. Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass destruction? A: To use them in a war, silly. Q: I'm confused.  If thy had all those weapons that they planned to use in war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we went to war with them? A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had those weapons, so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves. Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy.  Why would they choose to die if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with? A: It's a different culture.  It's not supposed to make sense. Q: I don't know about you, bit I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did. A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons.  We had another good reason to invade them anyway. Q: And what was that? A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country. Q: Why?  What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country? A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people. Q: Kind of like what they do in China? A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq.  China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make US corporations richer. Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people? A: Right Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured? A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing their government.  People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured. Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China? A: I told you, China is different Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq? A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by Ba'ath party, while China is Communist Q: Didn't you one tell me Communists were bad? A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad. Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad? A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured. Q: Like Iraq? A: Exactly. Q: And like in China, too? A: I told you, Chinas a good economic competitor.  Cuba, on the other hand is not. Q: How come Cuba isnt a good economic competitor? A: Well, you see, back in the 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us. Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba and started doing business with them, wouldnt that help the Cubans become Capitalists? A: Dont be a smart-ass Q: I didnt think I was being one. A: Well, anyway, they also dont have freedom of religion in Cuba Q: Kind of like China and the Falun Gong movement? A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway, Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so hes not really a legitimate leader anyway. Q: Whats a military coup? A: Thats when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States Q: Didnt the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup? A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend. Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate? A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate. Q: Didnt you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader? A: Only Saddam Hussein.  Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan. Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan? A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th. Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th? A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked our four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings, killing over 3,000 Americans. Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that? A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban. Q: Arent the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off peoples heads and hands? A: Yes, that is exactly who they were.  Not only did they chop off peoples heads and hands, but they oppressed women too. Q: Didnt the Bush administration give the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001? A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs. Q: Fighting drugs? A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies. Q: How did they do such a good job? A: Simple.  If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off. Q: So when the Taliban but off peoples heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK. But, not if they cut peoples heads and hands off for other reasons? A: Yes. Its OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off peoples hand for growing flowers, but its cruel if they cut of peoples hands for stealing bread. Q: Dont they also cut off peoples hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?  A: Thats different.  Afghanistan was ruled by tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burquas whenever they were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply. Q: Dont Saudi women have to wear burqas in public, too? A: No, Saudi women merely wear a tradition Islamic body covering Q: Whats the difference? A: The traditional Islamic covering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a womans body except for her eyes and fingers.  The burqa on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a womans body except for her eyes and fingers. Q: Is sounds like the same thing with a different name. A: Now, dont go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.  The Saudis are our friends. Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.  A: Yes but they trained in Afghanistan Q: Who trained them? A: A very bad man, Osama bin Laden. Q: Was he from Afghanistan? A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too.  But he was a bad man, a very bad man. Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once. A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s. Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire Ronald Regan talked about? A: There are no more Soviets.  The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or thereabouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us.  We call them Russians now. Q: So the SovietsI mean Russians are our friends? A: Well, not really.  You see they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, but then they decided no to support our invasion of Iraq, so were mad at them now.  Were also mad at the French and Germans because they didnt help us invade Iraq either. Q: So the French and Germans are evil too? A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom fries and Freedom toast. Q: Do we always rename food whenever another country doesnt do what we want them to do? A: No, we just do that to our friends.  Our enemies, we invade. Q: But wasnt Iraq one of our friends back in the 1980s? A: Well, yeah.  For a while. Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then? A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily. Q: Why did that make him our friend? A: Because at the time, Iran was our enemy. Q: Isnt that when he gassed the Kurds? A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him that we were his friend. Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend? A: Most of the time, yes. Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy? A: Sometimes thats true too.  However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all the better. Q: Why? A: Because was is good for the economy, which means war is good for America.  Also, since God is on Americas side, anyone who opposes war is a godless un-American Communist.  Do you understand why we attacked Iraq? Q: I think so.  We attacked them because God wanted us to, right? A: Yes. Q: But how did we know God wonted us to attack Iraq? A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do. Q: So basically, what youre saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush heard voices in his head? A: Yes! You finally understand how the world works.  Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep.  Good Night. Good night Daddy!",

        "blog_text": "The action of Subway Betting was started in Pittsburgh shortly after I left Carnegie Mellon University. Maybe someone can remember its exact origin - the first Subway bet even - but I think this is unimportant. What we really need to do is teach the world about Subway Betting and help them make bets on their own. It's quite simple really - with a normal wager one bets on whether or not an action will occur. Usually this is done with money being the actual item that is bet: Bettor: 'I'll bet you $5 that I can get that girl's number' Bettee: 'The one over at the bar on the end their in the little red dress?' Bettor: 'Yeah' Bettee: 'Sure, I'll take that bet. There is no way you'll get her number. She's way out of your league. You've got no chance. I mean, look at you - you're balding at the young age of 24, you've got a big nose, you're not that smooth really, and besides, you look way too Jewish for her.' Bettor: 'Oh, I see how it is. You're such a dick. Do you really think all of this because I'll tell you something else - you're not so special either! I mean, look at those ears? Could they stick out any farther? And have you looked at your clothes lately?' Bettee: 'What's wrong with my clothes? I shop at B-Rep. This shirt cost me $75!' Bettor: 'Oh, get off your goddamn high horse already. You bought that shirt at Banana Republic 5 years ago and you wear it everyday' Well, you get the idea. But with a Subway Bet, rather than bet actual money you bet foot long Subway sandwiches. Let's take a look at the above example, only this time we'll recreate it with Subway Betting. Bettor: 'You owe me 3 Subway if I can get that girl's number.' Bettee: '3? Alright, you're on - but there is no doubling the meat!' So if the bettor succeeds in getting this girl's number (and trust me, he won't), the bettee owes 3 footlong Subway sandwiches to the bettor. It is important to note a few things about Subway Betting: The bet can really be on anything - the above examples were based on one person performing an action. We often bet on things like this (pouring water on a former student body president's chest; pouring beer on a DJ's table; getting your VW Golf up to 55 on 5th; asking a Subway Sandwich Artist whether the meat would be doubled linearly or exponentially if you double the meat on a sandwich and then double it again) but we also often bet on events out of our control: sporting events, random occurances - just about anything. Unless specified, bets do not go 'both ways.' This means that in the above example, if the bettor does not get the girl's number, no Subway is exchanged. Usually, if there is to be a 2 way bet, it will be for two distinct outcomes of one event. For example, 'You owe me 5 Subway if Tiger Woods wins the Masters.' 'Okay, but you owe me 5 if Vijay Singh wins.' Unless specified, there is no doubling the meat when collecting your sandwich(es) Though we will more often bet by saying, 'You owe me X Subway if...' you can also bet by saying, 'I will give you X Subway if...' Subway has become quite a commodity among my group of friends and I'm told that in Pittsburgh winnings are collected weekly. One person has even bet infinite Subway and lost. It has been said that a select group of people will do almost anything to win Subway. And I, young voters, can attest to this. Please, gather 'round as I tell you all the story of one Parag Patel (a.k.a. 'Sexy Little Otter,' a.k.a. SLO) and his quest to win Subway. Several months ago SLO and I went to The 9:30 Club to see The Super Furry Animals. Neither of us had ever seen them in concert, but SLO was a fan and I had enjoyed the few listens I had given the band while riding in SLO's BMW 325xi. We got to the show pretty early and were standing around talking and making random Subway bets when SLO says to me, 'You owe me Subway if we see anyone on stage in a yeti costume.' He combines this with a laugh as if it is the most random thing he has ever heard, despite saying it himself. So I think about it and even though it feels like the odds of a yeti running on to the stage are pretty slim, there is always a chance, but what are the odds of 5 yetis running on to the stage? So I respond with, '5 yetis!' He tries to talk me down to 3 but I stick to my guns and eventually he accepts the 5 yeti bet. Eventually the band comes on, does their thing, plays a grand finale and runs off the stage. There are 5 band members but only 4 run off the stage. The 5th guy was kind of a DJ but instead of record tables he had a computer and keyboards. He sits behind his computer for awhile creating all kinds of weird noises and we all wait patiently, thinking there was nothing more after he left. And then it happened - before my very eyes I see several men run on to the stage in yeti costumes, grab their instruments and start playing. SLO and I quickly count the yetis to find only 4 of them. I celebrate, SLO cries and the band plays on. It turns out SLO knew the whole time that this was a possibility. In a few previous concerts the band had played entire shows in yeti costumes. SLO knew this information but kept it to himself when making the Subway bet. As deceptive as this is, SLO claims he was just 'playing the odds.' He'll do just about anything for Subway, I say. But please, don't let SLO's dirty tricks turn you off from doing your own Subway Betting. In fact, you better get in on the Subway Betting Market as soon as possible before Subway replaces 'money' as actual currency. Trust me, this is a definite possibility.",

        "blog_text": "I don't know how I can live with this kind of thinking and I am always thinking about what j.k has said about living and seeing the life as a different way in which no one is going to help you. Even jk also included. yes, noone can understand him,cos we have no idea about us then  how can we think others mind and the thought?  I'm reading ' krishnamurti for beginners (KFI)' and 'Mind according to Vedanta ( swami satya prakasananda)' . JK is challenging each and everything i thought to be true in a polarised way. Then what is life???  I have no idea and I think no one can give you answer to this complex question in words. You cannot find the meaning and definition for life in  some words. Even for some feelings you won't find any words. Then how can you find the meaning for life? life is vast , infinite,full of challenges not the exams and the problems created by the narrowminded thinking. but a vastness... how can I write anything which  I haven idea?? i have been pursuing this single question from the day it came into my mind and  i am deeply involved in this worldly affairs these days and i want to get out of this lives burdens. i hate to be bound by anything, whether it is family , marriage career .Nothing interests me more than life life i like..  here is  a posting  from JK' s ' a dialogue with oneself, and i have to read it:   A DIALOGUE WITH ONESELF   I realize that love cannot exist when there is jealousy; love cannot exist when there is attachment. Now, is it possible for me to be free of jealousy and attachment? I realize that I do not love. That is a fact. I am not going to deceive myself; I am not going to pretend to my wife that I love her. I do not know what love is. But I do know that I am jealous and I do know that I am terribly attached to her and that in attachment there is fear, there is jealousy, anxiety; there is a sense of dependence. I do not like to depend but I depend because I am lonely; I am shoved around in the office, in the factory and I come home and I want to feel comfort and companionship, to escape from myself. Now I ask myself: how am I to be free of this attachment? I am taking that just as an example.      At first, I want to run away from the question. I do not know how it is going to end up with my wife. When I am really detached from her my relationship to her may change. She might be attached to me and I might not be attached to her or to any other woman. But I am going to investigate. So I will not run away from what I imagine might be the consequence of being totally free of all attachment. I do not know what love is, but I see very clearly, definitely, without any doubt, that attachment to my wife means jealousy, possession, fear, anxiety and I want freedom from all that. So I begin to enquire; I look for a method and I get caught in a system. Some guru says: 'I will help you to be detached, do this and this; practice this and this.' I accept what he says because I see the importance of being free and he promises me that if I do what he says I will have reward. But I see that way that I am looking for reward. I see how silly I am; wanting to be free and getting attached to a reward.      I do not want to be attached and yet I find myself getting attached to the idea that somebody, or some book, or some method, will reward me with freedom from attachment. So, the reward becomes an attachment. So I say: 'Look what I have done; be careful, do not get caught in that trap.' Whether it is a woman, a method, or an idea, it is still attachment. I am very watchful now for I have learned something; that is, not to exchange attachment for something else that is still attachment.      I ask myself: 'What am I to do to be free of attachment?' What is my motive in wanting to be free of attachment? Is it not that I want to achieve a state where there is no attachment, no fear and so on? And I suddenly realize that motive gives direction and that direction will dictate my freedom. Why have a motive? What is motive? A motive is a hope, or a desire, to achieve something. I see that I am attached to a motive. Not only my wife, not only my idea, the method, but my motive has become my attachment! So I am all the time functioning within the field of attachment - the wife, the method and the motive to achieve something in the future. To all this I am attached. I see that it is a tremendously complex thing; I did not realize that to be free of attachment implied all this. Now, I see this as clearly as I see on a map the main roads, the side roads and the villages; I see it very clearly. Then I say to myself: 'Now, is it possible for me to be free of the great attachment I have for my wife and also of the reward which I think I am going to get and of my motive?' To all this I am attached. Why? Is it that I am insufficient in myself? Is it that I am very very lonely and therefore seek to escape from that feeling of isolation by turning to a woman, an idea, a motive; as if I must hold onto something? I see that it is so, I am lonely and escaping through attachment to something from that feeling of extraordinary isolation.      So I am interested in understanding why I am lonely, for I see it is that which makes me attached. That loneliness has forced me to escape through attachment to this or to that and I see that as long as I am lonely the sequence will always be this. What does it mean to be lonely? How does it come about? Is it instinctual, inherited, or is it brought about by my daily activity? If it is an instinct, if it is inherited, it is part of my lot; I am not to blame. But as I do not accept this, I question it and remain with the question. I am watching and I am not trying to find an intellectual answer. I am not trying to tell the loneliness what it should do, or what it is; I am watching for it to tell me. There is a watchfulness for the loneliness to reveal itself. It will not reveal itself if I run away; if I am frightened; if I resist it. So I watch it. I watch it so that no thought interferes. Watching is much more important than thought coming in. And because my whole energy is concerned with the observation of that loneliness thought does not come in at all. The mind is being challenged and it must answer. Being challenged it is in a crisis. In a crisis you have great energy and that energy remains without being interfered with by thought. This is a challenge which must be answered.      I started out having a dialogue with myself. I asked myself what is this strange thing called love; everybody talks about it, writes about it - all the romantic poems, pictures, sex and all other areas of it? I ask: is there such a thing as love? I see it does not exist when there is jealousy, hatred, fear. So I am not concerned with love anymore; I am concerned with `what is', my fear, my attachment. Why am I attached? I see that one of the reasons - I do not say it is the whole reason - is that I am desperately lonely, isolated. The older I grow the more isolated I become. So I watch it. This is a challenge to find out, and because it is a challenge all energy is there to respond. That is simple. If there is some catastrophe, an accident or whatever it is, it is a challenge and I have the energy to meet it. I do not have to ask: 'How do I get this energy?' When the house is on fire I have the energy to move; extraordinary energy. I do not sit back and say: 'Well, I must get this energy' and then wait; the whole house will be burned by then.      So there is this tremendous energy to answer the question: why is there this loneliness? I have rejected ideas, suppositions and theories that it is inherited, that it is instinctual. All that means nothing to me. Loneliness is `what is'. Why is there this loneliness which every human being, if he is at all aware, goes through, superficially or most profoundly? Why does it come into being? Is it that the mind is doing something which is bringing it about? I have rejected theories as to instinct and inheritance and I am asking: is the mind, the brain itself, bringing about this loneliness, this total isolation? Is the movement of thought doing this? Is the thought in my daily life creating this sense of isolation? In the office I am isolating myself because I want to become the top executive, therefore thought is working all the time isolating itself. I see that thought is aIl the time operating to make itself superior, the mind is working itself towards this isolation.      So the problem then is: why does thought do this? Is it the nature of thought to work for itself? Is it the nature of thought to create this isolation? Education brings about this isolation; it gives me a certain career, a certain specialization and so, isolation. Thought, being fragmentary, being limited and time binding, is creating this isolation. In that limitation, it has found security saying: 'I have a special career in my life; I am a professor; I am perfectly safe.' So my concern is then: why does thought do it? Is it in its very nature to do this? Whatever thought does must be limited. Now the problem is: can thought realize that whatever it does is limited, fragmented and therefore isolating and that whatever it does will be thus? This is a very important point: can thought itself realize its own limitations? Or am I telling it that it is limited? This, I see, is very important to understand; this is the real essence of the matter. If thought realizes itself that it is limited then there is no resistance, no conflict; it says, 'I am that'. But if I am telling it that it is limited then I become separate from the limitation. Then I struggle to overcome the limitation, therefore there is conflict and violence, not love.      So does thought realize of itself that it is limited? I have to find out. I am being challenged. Because I am challenged I have great energy. Put it differently: does consciousness realize its content is itself? Or is it that I have heard another say: 'Consciousness is its content; its content makes up consciousness'? Therefore I say, 'Yes, it is so'. Do you see the difference between the two? The latter, created by thought, is imposed by the `me'. If I impose something on thought then there is conflict. It is like a tyrannical government imposing on someone, but here that government is what I have created.      So I am asking myself: has thought realized its own limitations? Or is it pretending to be something extraordinary, noble, divine? - which is nonsense because thought is based on memory. I see that there must be clarity about this point: that there is no outside influence imposing on thought saying it is limited. Then, because there is no imposition there is no conflict; it simply realizes it is limited; it realizes that whatever it does - its worship of god and so on - is limited, shoddy, petty - even though it has created marvelous cathedrals throughout Europe in which to worship.      So there has been in my conversation with myself the discovery that loneliness is created by thought. Thought has now realized of itself that it is limited and so cannot solve the problem of loneliness. As it cannot solve the problem of loneliness, does loneliness exist? Thought has created this sense of loneliness, this emptiness, because it is limited, fragmentary, divided and when it realizes this, loneliness is not, therefore there is freedom from attachment. I have done nothing; I have watched the attachment, what is implied in it, greed, fear, loneliness, all that and by tracing it, observing it, not analyzing it, but just looking, looking and looking, there is the discovery that thought has done all this. Thought, because it is fragmentary, has created this attachment. When it realizes this, attachment ceases. There is no effort made at all. For the moment there is effort - conflict is back again.      In love there is no attachment; if there is attachment there is no love. There has been the removal of the major factor through negation of what it is not, through the negation of attachment. I know what it means in my daily life: no remembrance of anything my wife, my girl friend, or my neighbor did to hurt me; no attachment to any image thought has created about her; how she has bullied me, how she has given me comfort, how I have had pleasure sexually, all the different things of which the movement of thought has created images; attachment to those images has gone.      And there are other factors: must I go through all those step by step, one by one? Or is it all over? Must I go through, must I investigate - as I have investigated attachment - fear, pleasure and the desire for comfort? I see that I do not have to go through all the investigation of all these various factors; I see it at one glance, I have captured it.      So, through negation of what is not love, love is. I do not have to ask what love is. I do not have to run after it. If I run after it, it is not love, it is a reward. So I have negated, I have ended, in that enquiry, slowly, carefully, without distortion, without illusion, everything that it is not - the other is.",

        "blog_text": "Manny Low Manny Low Manny Low   Don't read this if you want humour, its not azgezesque. class XI is over. We're going to 12th. I m freaked. See, its not that I m scared about the fact that its a board year, though that doesn't quite cheer me up anyways. What I'm getting freaked out is the fact that its the last year in school. Its fucking freaky. Hello, I'm a kid still, Don't make me leave school!  I've always had trouble adjusting to new situations. In Infant, I used to howl when we had to go to school. In Vasant Vihar I was fine, largely because mama was there, I was then (and still am, when I m nervous) a mamma's boy. There's nothing like mama for making everything seem better.  In RKP, I hated it, It was largely because I didn't have many friends inita\\ially, and I was also a horrible person, After I got friends by the end of VIIth, life improved and by class VIII I actually started enjoying life.  Lekin 10th, 10th was a turning point in my scholastic life. Finally I found a great set of friends, people who I'm very thankful to. My quizzing career, that Se Evil Udita had put into cold storage again kick-started after the Columban and Bongo (Siddharth Banerjee to all those who don't know him). Bongo took us under his wing, and, against Prema Ma'am's advice, took us for a quiz meant exclusively for class XI and XII, in which we managed to come 2nd. That was the actual start of Quizzing in RKP. We (PC, Bhavya, Anurag and Manav, in that order) went from strength to strength in this year, managing to always come either 2nd or 3rd, something that has managed to dog us until this year.  The pre-boards went very well, and gave me confidence for the boards, in which I was;t bad. By the end of 10th, everything was at its peak.  Since then, its not been as good, though its still been close.  I haven't had as much fun in Class in class XI as I managed in Class X, caused in part due to my moronic class in the dungeon block, in which everyone(with the exception of 5 people) have an IQ of x, where x is numerically so small that x square and higher powers cannot be considered. As a result of all these, I ve been bored in class. Very Bored.  On the Quiz and Personal front however, its been getting better. If you read Bhavya's blog, you get some idea of their quizzing success, in most of which I've also played a part, albeit a small one. Personally, I ve made great friends while keeping track of my old (and best) ones. My circle of friends is at its peak.  Now 12th. End of school. I m petrified. Let nothing change. Let ze bonds never grow weaker. Life's been the best I've had for the last two years, specially in school, Please, life, stay that way.  I have no doubt this'll seem very corny to all of you, me too by the morning. But right now, at 12.47 am. I say thanks. Thank you god, for all that I have. Thank you life, for all that you have given me. At this point, this minute, this juncture in life, I honestly feel I have no regrets. I know that I will have remembered some by the morning, that by the morning I'll revert to my pessimistic, low, boring self. I know that I may be low again, I know that I've screwed up my papers, but I have no regrets, none whatsoever, in these past two years.  May this be the case with me the day I die too. (No, I am not suicidal!, I m rambling, I know. Don't read this if you want humour, it doesn't have much). I once read something about an old woman whose family prepared a wonderful dinner for her, and after that she went for a walk and never came back. She was blessed. How lovely it would be to die when one is at peace with oneself, when one can honestly say 'Thank you God, for all you have given to me'.  Hai Ram, what all have I been writing!

        "blog_text": "Hi, today I am very excited about the guest here with me. I don't know him personally, but he works with my friend Michelle, (who, as you'll recall, is interviewed a couple of posts down) and is also a graphic artist. His name is Dennis. So, let's get cracking and jump right into it.  KC: Dennis, for our viewing audience, could you please provide a little background on your ethnicity?  DS: I was born in Seoul, Korea in 1969. My 2nd Generation Irish and 1/8 Polish father (born in a small farm outside of Litchfield, KY), was drafted by the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War at the age of 21. Luckily for him, he was stationed in Korea. My father met my mother, at the age of 27, and in one of those boom-boom clubs the soldiers would go to after hours. They got some boom-boom on them and started dating.  Six months later, they decided to get married and ran into a host of trouble because of restrictions the military sets on dating between foreign nationals and U.S. Soldiers during war time. They somehow got through all the red tape, and married overseas. I came along, and by my second birthday, we moved to Ft. Bragg South Carolina and finally moved to Kentucky by my 6th birthday.   I've been living around red-necks ever since. I guess that makes me: 1/2 Korean, 1/4 Irish, 1/8 Polish and 1/8 Redneck.  KC: I have to say that the similarities between our backgrounds are uncanny. I was also born in 1969; although, only conceived in Seoul, Korea. I actually popped out in Fort Gordon, GA. My father (who is half Irish and half Czechoslovakian) was stationed in Korea and met my mother through mutual friends. They also decided to get married after just a couple of months, but because my mother was converting to Catholicism to marry my father, they didn't have a church wedding until a few months after their 'official wedding' at the embassy. Apparently, the two of them went to get their paperwork and they called my father into the office while my mother waited in the hall. My father says the guy behind the desk signed a piece of paper, handed it to him and said, 'Congratulations, you're married.' Have you ever heard a more romantic story? Yeah, gotta love the US government. Now, how would you describe your experiences growing up half-Korean in America?  DS: It's really comforting (and a bit disturbing) to know that other people have had similar experiences in the past.  Growing up half-Korean... well, it wasn't a pleasurable experience early on: I went to public schools; was very shy throughout grade school, was 1 of only 3 Asian kids in a fairly redneck high school going through some segregation wars; was short for my age until late high school; and my last name was Smiley (for those of you who grew up in the 80's, you know why that name was a popular [ha] name).  Anyway, because of this combination, I really recessed into my studies and sports. I don't know if I was really that introverted, I just felt more comfortable alone ? and more in-charge (throughout my grade school years).  Interestingly enough, my sister had a lot of the same experiences but it had an opposite effect on her. She became super-extroverted and became a wild child. I look back now and wish she did not hang around the 'wrong' kinds of kids, just because they accepted her for who she was. At 28, she is still making up for many of her mistakes during the middle/high school years.  This is what I think happened to me: I became overly sensitive to other people's feelings, but became de-sensitized to being different. In fact, when I was in the Army (2 years active, 4 years reserves), my fellow soldier's called me 'mother' because I always took care of everyone and watched out for them (when someone was in trouble, I would always be called). Because I started to care less for my insecurities, I started to excel in anything that posed itself as a challenge. That is what I would focus on and that is the way I am even to this day. It's why I am in the creative field, I'm sure (It's always different and there are many challenges).  P.S. ? I often make super non-politically correct statements (some Asian statement even offend white people), because I really believe all cultures have some area of hilarity ? and it is ridiculous to think any one culture should have to be tippy-toed around, as to not 'offend' anyone. So, if I have offended anyone, get over it. Don't take yourself so seriously ? it builds character.  KC: Well, I wasn't really introverted. My father stayed in the Army until I was a sophomore in college, so we (I have a younger sister and younger brother) moved a lot. When I was in the primary grades (K-3), we lived in Augusta, Ga. because my father was stationed at Ft. Gordon and I remember getting a lot of shit from a good  number of people in Georgia. To this day, it's really, really hard for me hear a southern accent and not immediately have negative feelings. I'm obviously able to get over it because it's a stupid reaction, but it's an instinctive thing now. At any rate, I can remember being mad because I'd get called names and they wouldn't even be right. This one girl would call me Chinese girl or Japanese girl, and my mom said I'd come home from school and yell that people were stupid because they didn't know I was Korean. But since we moved around a lot, I never felt the compulsion to really try and fit in because I knew we were going to be gone in a couple of years. As far as being politically uncorrect, go for it. I think people are way to concerned about how PC they are and it has a stifling effect because people are too scared to say anything. In general, I think everybody needs to chill out and not take any of it too seriously.  I find the statement about your sister interesting because I've read some articles where a lot of Asian-American men feel they're getting the short end of the stick because mainstream American culture seems more accepting of images of Asian women and embraces them more readily, and that the men still have to struggle to be considered attractive and 'viable' potential partners. What do you think about that?  DS: Not touting my own horn, but I've never really been in a position of feeling that unattractive (I'm high yellow you know). However, because of the insecurities that I felt for feeling different, I think it did cause me to become an over-achiever at a pretty young age. In fact, I choose to challenge and put myself in situations of extreme discomfort at times, just to get the feeling of accomplishment achieving my goal.  I don't look to put others down or am so competitive that I lose sight of why I do things, I just think that I always have to prove to myself that I am as good as anyone else or sometimes even better. The weird thing is, when I accomplish something, it becomes less of a challenge the second time. So, I usually look toward the next challenge.  An example is: Last year my wife and I thought about building a house. We found a lot in a nice neighborhood and started to talk to builders. After talking to several General Contractors, I started noticing that none were that detail-oriented. I was a little uneasy with not knowing where we were on a budget until toward the completion of a house, so I started to gather information and references on top-notch contractors in the area which we were going to live. After 5 months of planning (in the midst of contractors and friends objections because of the pitfalls and my lack of experience in the field of construction), I had a hole dug and started to contract out our house.   We are moving in this weekend, as a mater of fact. I look back now at all of  the trials and worries I went through (I kept my wife out of most of it, until the painting stage), and realized that I thoroughly enjoyed the process of learning and embarking on an unknown challenge. I guess all I needed was a few people to say '...you're not going to be able to do this...'   Anyway, I feel rising above all of my insecurities and living through all of the ridicule in childhood helped me develop as an achiever and a person that truly enjoys watching and helping others succeed.  KC: It's refreshing to hear that despite having been teased as a child, you didn't use your race as an excuse to not keep trying in life. I've had a similar perspective in my life. I never thought or felt that being half-Asian limited me in any way, despite the fact that there were people who were never going to let me forget that I didn't look like them. But, I think that's the way that it should be. I feel absolutely no sympathy for 'minorities' who whine that they haven't been able to accomplish what they want because someone is keeping them down. It's all a lot of self-pitying crap, as far as I'm concerned. Now, I'm going to veer off from the race questions a bit and ask what do you think is the primary source of conflict between men and women?  DS: I think it's sex.  Not simply a physical activity thing, it can be that as well, but I don't believe it is a subject. It believe that we are 'wired' a little different at birth.  I'm a very creative person, so I'm very open-minded, but when I'm asked a question that is (to me) that ambiguous, I usually fall back to scientific studies and develop theories from a mix of written information and my own observations.  I think that because of instinct, as an incredibly adaptable species our opposites (sometimes the same sex  though I believe one partner takes on the opposite role) are sought after for balance (for survival).  Anyway, men are more technical-task oriented and women are more cognitiveabstract thinkers. Obviously, there are exceptions to this theory, but I think that in many cases, the origin of most conflicts between men and women is the simple fact of how we are 'programmed' at birth.  Example:  A woman sits on a sofa in her living room tackling a crossword puzzle. Her spouse comes into the room and sits on the sofa next to her he sits deeply with his head back and eyes closed.  A few minutes pass by and she says, 'Honey, what's on your mind?'  Her spouse glances sideways at her and says, 'Nothin'.'  The woman says in a puzzled voice, 'You have to have something on your mind.'  The spouse replies (and folks, he really means it), 'No, I've got nothing on my mind... just resting'.  KC: Hmmm, interesting. So let me ask you, do men consider sex a 'technical task' and that it's not wrapped up in something more than just the physical and mechanical process of engaging in intercourse?  DS: That's kind of a hard question to answer quickly. I think a lot of men have some complexity in their thinking when it comes to the subject of sex, but I would also add that in my opinion (whether most educated men would admit to this or not) most men would put on their list of importance first  the 'technical task'. Sex (the full scope of the meaning something more), would come in second.   The best way to describe it, for me, is that if we use it in the context of the solar system (the full definition of sex being the solar system), most men would say the whole solar system is the physical activity of engaging in intercourse instead of saying the sun is the physical activity and is just part of a bigger picture.  I really believe, that at the center of the pursuit for the opposite sex, men (just like males in any animal species) initially pursue sex for the physical contact/act itself  not for anything greater. Relationships that happen to develop from this contact is most times tertiary.  But, I do not want to rationalize. I think the question depends on the masculinity, the femininity, the background, and the culture of the man in question. Personally speaking, I think the definition is greater  or maybe I have just convinced myself that it is. To be absolutely, totally honest, when I read your question, images of attractive women engaging in the physical act itself (okay there was one ugly one) immediately streamed through my mind.  KC: OK, so tell me truthfully, do men consider having to deal with the emotional side of a relationship just the trade-off for having access to regular sex? And why did you imagine one ugly woman? Was it to keep the fantasy more realistic?  DS: I think that men consciously or unconsciously, at first, think of the emotional side as a trade off (or maybe as an obstacle). At that point, they might realize something more in a relationship (a longing or maybe a connection with the person) or sensing more, they might start developing a way to get out of the situation with as little complications as possible.  The men that say they have always looked for a relationship and something more before sex crosses their minds, are either not telling the whole truth, or have been so ingrained with that idea in their upbringing that they  honestly think they believe what they are saying.  The ugly woman keeps it more realistic, but (beauty is only skin deep) she might bring more to the table than the more attractive ones might not. Also, maybe subconsciously it's comfortable to have someone to fall back to that doesn't make me conscious of my insecurities.  KC: I find this fascinating....So, why do men marry? What do they get out of marriage?  DS: Men marry because there is some sort of connection above and beyond the initial sexual attraction. This can come at any time in a relationship (after the initial attraction) and, in my observations, can be attributed to several things: The woman can have physical or behavioral characteristics of the man's mother (or his mother figure in childhood) and he just feels 'at home' with her; The woman may fit all the criteria for the man's image of the 'perfect' woman and he may not want to 'share her' with anyone else; he may have a low self-esteem (or may be unattractive) and upon a long search for someone to have relations with, falls 'in love' with the first person he sleeps with (feeling that this only comes along once in a life-time); and finally he may find a person in which there is much in common and he just feels 'right' with  wanting to sustain that feeling forever.  KC: So do men really 'love' women, or are they just fulfilling some other territorial compulsion left over from when we still lived in caves? Even in the case of men who marry the first girl they have sex with, the instinctual drive could be to form a 'tribe' because, historically speaking, it's easier to survive within a group than on one's own.  DS: I believe love has a different meaning to any given man. We definitely are brought into the world with that instinctual 'tribe' mentality, so I would say that many men fit the criteria of the caveman. However with the power and the complications of the human brain, I think there are many men, as well, that believe that they truly 'love'.  For example, I truly love my wife. But is it love in the conscious sense of what most of us believe  defined? Or is it a combination of what I've been taught from childhood with a subconscious underlying instinctual drive? I don't really know the correct answer, but I lean more toward the latter.  KC: What do you think love is for women, then?  DS: I dont think that love is only for women. But referencing the the original question of the source of conflicts, I think men and women's idea of what love is, (besides a connection to someone) is different. Sex (the physical act) shares a larger part in the man's idea of love.  KC: What's been the hardest thing you and your wife have had to overcome in your relationship?  DS: The hardest thing we've had to overcome has been the loss of my father two years ago from a massive heart attack at the age of 50, and 6 months later the loss of my wife's father from a freak car accident. It really was taxing on the relationship.  KC: In what way? Taxing to the point that it could have meant the break-up in your marriage, or taxing in that you both needed a level of support that the other wasn't prepared to offer given your individual griefs?  DS: It's a bit complicated. I'm the oldest son (I have only a younger sister), so when my father died it was a shock to the family. Because my mother is Korean and her support group was members of her Korean church, I became the main facilitator and support person for my mother. With all the things that needed to put to rest (setting social security, funeral arrangements, investments), I really did not have time to grieve.  By the time things were pretty much in order, my wife's father is in a car accident and we have to travel to Illinois to attend the funeral and take care of family stuff there (my wife is the oldest sister of four). My wife and her father never really had a great relationship. Her father left her mom when she was 4 years old, and my wife has kind of held that against him. However, about a year before his passing, I convinced my wife to put the past behind her and try to strike up a relationship with her father and his new life. She gave in and forgave him as well and something in herself. I am so happy she did that before the accident.  Anyway, after my father-in-law's funeral, we take it upon ourselves to be the support group for my wife's mother and family. By the time both of our families lives are moving toward a balance, we are both grieving our losses. This puts both of us in a dark, depression stage. We tried to be so supportive of each other, but there was distance, emotionally and of course, physically. After about a year of this, and many talks of the subject, we started on a course of finding out what good came of the deaths. The more we looked, the more we discovered silver linings in our families and our lives.  I look back now and so much good has come out of the two deaths. We care more about people rather than life as a big picture. Corny as it sounds, we started to actually 'stop and smell the roses.' I honestly don't think I would have jumped into contracting our new home (with no knowledge of building) if the deaths did not happen. We also have a longing appreciation of each and every friend, family and child that we know. It's sounds clich, I know, but it has changed our lives to the point that we came back to the crossroads in life and have taken the path that we at one time did not choose.  KC: Yeah, it's amazing the sorts of challenges life throws at you. My husband and I had a really rough period after our daughter was born. We had just moved to Indiana two months earlier so I could attend graduate school, and we didn't have any family around to fall on, and trying to get on track with new jobs and school and baby was really, really hard. I have a tendency to turn inward and just focus on getting done what needs to be done and not worrying about what's going on beyond that. Needless to say, it put a lot of strain on our marriage and we were both miserable and angry at each other for a really healthy chunk of time. At any rate, we kind of forced ourselves to talk about the situation and try to examine what was going on and what the causes of it were, and over time we were able to get rid of a lot of the harmful emotions and habits. Any marriage is a compromise and looking back on it, you definitely feel pride in knowing you tackled it together and were able to come through the fire intact. So what do you think it is about so many marriages today that make people not willing to do the hard work required of staying together?  DS: Methinks that has several answers. Some people do not have the aptitude for the level of empathy and compassion to make a marriage last. Some are too lazy to make the effort to work at the relationship. Some have too much pride to admit when they are wrong or to let their spouse win some, lose some.   Finally, some come from backgrounds where there hasn't been a role model (or models) to give them the tools for making a marriage and family work. That is why kids of divorced parents statistically have higher divorce rates (when reaching the appropriate age to marry), than children of happily married couples.  KC: Well, it's no secret that over the past few decades the divorce rate in America has sky-rocketed. Do you think couples split more easily today because there's no longer the social stigma attached to divorce that there once was, or do you think there's been a fundamental break-down in the perceived sanctity of marriage in our country, or do you think it's something altogether different?  DS: I think both of those apply. People are getting so used to hearing about divorce, it's almost like saying 'were buying a house'. It's commonplace to hear younger couples talk about their second marriage. Also, there is a breakdown in the sanctity of marriage. I talk to young people all the time about marriage and to them it is a 'thing' you do. If it doesn't work out, there is a way 'out'.  It's not just a marriage thing, I think the less-than-thirty generation (sounds familiar) is bombarded with contradictions in issues of morality that we and our parents hold true. Bill Clinton, for example, not only has given everyone the public impression that he cheats on his wife, but ask any teen if a blowjob is sex and a high group will tell you 'no'.  KC: So what needs to happen? What do we, as a society, need to do to make young people realize marriage is a lifelong process that takes a lot of hard work and commitment, and isn't one of those 'crazy' little things you do like piercing your belly-button?  DS: I don't really know if it is a fix we can do in our generation but we could lay the groundwork for it on a big picture scale: media, government (local) messaging, in school maybe. The school thing is so tricky. You cannot have religion-related stuff taught, but moral issues are for everyone.  I think it is a slow fix because from my own experience and observation, many of my close friends and family have children that have skewed ideas of morality. But many of them have strong moral convictions and are outstanding parents.  KC: You know, this might sound weird or prejudiced in some way, but my whole life I've thought most pure Americans--people whose parents are both American--are a little lazier and unmotivated than people who have at least one parent from another country. Obviously, this doesn't apply to everyone, but I think when someone has that kind of intimate outside exposure to something else, they tend to have a greater appreciation for the value of working for what you want and not expecting everything to just be handed to you. I think that plays into the morality thing because understanding you are accountable for your own actions and decisions goes hand-in-hand with morality. What are your thoughts on that?  DS: I absolutely believe that is true. I've seen it first hand with my family members that own businesses (Asian) and with the Mexicans (not Latin-Americans) working on my house. The amount of work that a person outputs is what they think is expected of themselves. But, the person that is accustomed to hard work, long-hours or less-than-perfect conditions has higher expectations of themselves. It's what they think of as normal.  That goes for a persons actions and decisions as well. However, it seems that each generation from the first in this country keeps their culture and teachings, but replace bits and pieces with the 'American' way of thinking. I'm guessing about the fourth or fifth generation will show only small amounts of the original culture.  KC: Do you have full Korean relatives living in the states? Cousins and such?  DS: Yes. Almost all of my mother's family, except a brother, live in the states. More than half here in Kentucky.  KC: And are you and your sister the only mixed children in the family?  DS: Yes. And yes there is a perceptible distiction from the full relatives (in their actions and conversations).  KC: Do you and your sister speak Korean?  DS: We both speak very broken Korean.  KC: My brother, sister and I don't speak any Korean except for a few phrases and I've found I feel a real grieving for not being able to speak the language because I can't interact with some of my relatives. How do your Korean relatives treat you? Do they view you as Korean or American?  DS: They definitely treat us as Americans. I also would like to speak to my grandmother, who only speaks korean.  KC: How does that make you feel? My American cousins view us as Korean and our Korean cousins view us as American, so we're an 'other' to everybody.  DS: It makes me want to excel and try harder at everything so that the family recognizes me for something they deem as respectful.  KC: Have you had friction in your relationship with your mother because she thinks your behavior is too American? That's definitely been an issue with my mom as I've grown up.  DS: No. I think that is more between women and their daughters. Mine was always looking good for the other family members because of my being the oldest son. My sister had much friction.  KC: Do your Korean aunts and uncles expect their kids to marry other Koreans?  DS: Absolutely. As a matter of fact, my mother was hurt and wouldn't talk to my wife (now) when we were dating, and even went out of her way to hurt my wife's feelings. All because she's white.  KC: But even your mom was upset? That's odd since she married a white man. My mother never worried about whether or not we ended up marrying white people, but I really think she was hoping my brother might marry  a korean girl. His girlfriend is white, so that's probably not going to happen. How did your wife handle this treatment?  DS: At first my wife was hurt. After about a year of dating, she tried to avoid her as much as possible and felt uncomfortable around her when my mom came to visit. But, after the two deaths, they've become much closer. They aren't your typical 'go out and shop' together mother and daughter-in-law, but we do take mom out to eat and spend more time with her.  KC: What do YOU think about your mother's reluctance to accept a non-Korean daughter-in-law?",

I got there, and we watched a movie, didn't talk much, and then a little flirting and pillow fighting later, you can guess what happened... but what you didn't guess was that some spark, some magical happening took place... we connected, instantly.  Emotions ran high the whole night and next morning, and we couldn't get enough of each other... I was scared because here was this guy I didn't even know and yet I was already developing strong feelings for him... in one night.  You'd think after 11 other relationships I would've known better, and I did, and yet I couldn't stop it from happening... and it happened, and I realized it, and I didn't know what to think... it was love at first sight.  At this point I would usually freak out, knowing that I was the insane one, that the other guy could'nt possibly be dealing with the same emotional adrenaline I was experiencing... but he was, just the same as me, a kindred spirit that had found his way into my life so unexpectedly and yet so unabashedly.  I have the missing piece to my life... the puzzle is now complete.  A guy who loves me and whom I love, and it's true, honest, and real... I've never been so sure of anything in my life.  I have found my soul mate, among the billions of people in the world.  I have become truly almighty.  Everything I've known in my past, all the love and sorrow and pain and pleasure... it's nothing... it's irrelevant.  My life begins again, reborn, renewed.

Nothing really, I have a job that challenges me everyday, a job that I have wanted and now I have.  Not a job but a career, how many people fresh out of college get their dream job?  Not many but I was among the lucky few, so why am I unhappy.   I want more with my life, but what is that 'more' that I want?  I can't put my finger on it and it is killing me.

I have a friend that says that I am not lonely because I have my family nearby.  We have different meanings of the term lonely.  My family is nearby and his isn't.  He is lonely without them.

        "blog_text": "I wasn't really sure I wanted to write about 9/11.  I was half wanting to write some intentionally light and just act like nothing was happening today.  Kinda the blog equivalent of UPN running the premiere of  The Mullets.   But, I expectedly didn't want to do the anything equivalent of  The Mullets.   I also didn't write anything too political about the exploitation of the tragedy by some for political gain, but that'll get me too mad.  I just want to tell my own personal story.  I didn't find out about the events on September 11 until shortly after 10am.  Back then, I more studiously followed my employers directive to only use my computer for work related activities.  I hadn't been on the web.  The office seemed quiet, especially given how busy we should have been that week.  Our annual meeting was at the end of the week.  But, it wasn't enough to catch my attention.  'The South Tower of the World Trade Center just collapsed.'  A co-worker quietly announced this to the office.  My first thought was whether there were any towers at Boston's World Trade Center at the waterfront.  The remark didn't make sense to me.  I just didn't get it.  So, I figured I could do a quick web check to see what is going on.  I still didn't get it.  I went to Yahoo and they just had a brief AP story.  It was unreal.  It didn't make sense.  This couldn't be true.  So, I went to Boston.com.  They had pictures.  I just stared at the image of the explosion caused by the second plane.  My heart dropped.  This wasn't real.  But, of course, it was.  I gathered with my co-workers in front of our television and saw the lone North Tower standing amid a cloud of dust.  I looked over and saw a much smaller building on fire.  'Wait, what's that on the left?'  'The Pentagon.'  'THE PENTAGON?!?'  I still didn't get it.  We were being attacked.  At that time, there was worry about tens of thousands of people in the towers.  It was too much.  Then, the announced that another hijacked plane was in the air.  It had crashed by then, we now know, but its not like there were cameras trained on rural Pennsylvania.  They knew very little then, and what we did know was that planes were hijacked out of Boston.  There was a lot of worry around, but most people stuck it out.  Even as the massive lonely towers of the Back Bay emptied blocks away.  We had to.  We had work.  My girlfriend at the time frequently went to the Prudential Center after getting off her overnight job.  I was worried that she might be stubborn and go anyway not knowing it was a moot point since the building was closed so I frantically tried to call her.  It took about three tries to get through.  I quickly asked if she could go straight home after work.  She indignantly asked why.  By the tone, I could tell that she wasn't just being stubborn.  I asked if she had watched TV at all since she got up, and she said no, and got worried and asked what had happened.  Which, meant I was going to have to tell her.  I was going to have to explain something I didn't even understand myself.  I tried to just do it as calmly as possible.  'Early this morning two planes were hijacked out of Boston...'  'Oh, my God,' she interjected.  As I continued, she just gasped as the horrible story kept going.  '...at 8:45, one of the planes flew into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York.  At about 9, another plane flew into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.'  'At about 9:45, another plane was flown into the Pentagon.  A little after 10, the South Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed.'  She gasps very loudly at this point, and was clearly overcome at the thought.  We all were.  'Shortly after that, part of the Pentagon collapsed.  At 10:30, the North Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed.  At some point, another plane was crashed somewhere near Pittsburgh.  They think there might be other hijacked planes, but no one really knows for sure right now.'  I was shaking the entire time.  I am shaking right now just recalling it.  She was stunned at all this, and I let her go to turn on the television like the rest of the nation, and start trying to understand it.  One thing I remember about that day was how quiet it was whenever I left my office.  A fighter jet flew over head during lunch, and you could just see the entire street stop and jerk their heads up trying to see what that was.  Everyone was completely on edge.  Staring blankly, looking defeated.  We found out that day that a woman who volunteered where I worked specifically as a consultant to my department was on Flight 11.  I know I wasn't affected the way many people were, but it was very difficult to comprehend that I knew someone who was among the first to die that day.  I went home that night and watched TV until 4am.  I know most people hated the news coverage, but I really needed it.  I needed to understand that this happened.  I needed to comprehend it.  I needed to see what had happened to let it sink in.  It hurt every time, but it was so difficult to grasp that I needed to see it.  I watched the video of the clouds of smoke billowing through the streets of Manhattan, frantic people running from it.  I saw every new video with interest, as part of the experience I needed to understand.  I watched as they discovered video of the first plane strike.  It took two years for another view of the first plane to show up, but video of the second strike kept popping up.  The ones that were the most difficult to watch were the ones from the ground.  At least, when the networks ran them with the original sound.  It was disturbing, but we needed to be disturbed.  How else could we react.  I viewed some of it again today and had the same sick feeling as you hear the plane roar from out of the camera's view and into the screen.  You saw it as the person holding the camera saw it.  You felt their fear and their horror as the plane banked into the building, sending an unimaginable fireball into the air.  It did a lot to make it real.  To make it something I could understand.  I needed that.  I later learned that someone I went to college with died in one of the towers.  He died a hero.  He was a volunteer firefighter turned investment something or other.  That day, he took out his red bandana, and proceeded to save many lives, eventually sacrificing his own.  My parents saw the second tower strike live.  My mother was listening to the radio when a caller came on talking about a fire at the Twin Towers.  She turned on the TV and saw the helicopter footage from the New York stations.  Then, another plane came into the screen and disappeared behind the South Tower before an explosion was seen.  As the days wore on, we all tried to pick up and move on.  They said irony was dead, but it lived on.  They said things would never be the same.  That's true, but things are never the same.  When The Onion finally published again, entitling its coverage 'Holy Fucking Shit', it signaled that we were getting back to normal.  American Life Turns into Bad Jerry Bruckheimer Movie meant a lot to make things feel okay again.  With the captions reading 'Actual photo from real life', it made it feel okay to laugh again.  It helped getting things back to normal.  Everyone has a story from those days.  Everyone has something to say.  If anything, the events brought us together through common experience, and a common compassion for the lives lost.  For those 3,000, we will remember.",

For the record, I'm claiming it's from one of the countless potholes that spring up, lurk around corners, and give birth to baby potholes during the night after the snowplows perform their annual exfoliation of city streets, but really it's because I was trying to read some assigned chapters for my graduate seminar tonight while I was driving. I heard the BLAMCAJUNKCAJUNK that I've grown accustomed to since I began honing my shitty, tire bursting driving habits and pulled over at a gas station to assess the damage. I was bent over in front of my wheel, simultaneously inspecting the tire for salvageability and shielding the general public from an intimate view of my ass crack when a brown paper bag wafted, American Beauty-style, down to the gravel in front of my feet. I looked up--and up--at a behemoth, Saudi Arabia-old field-subsidizing SUV and its diminutive driver sloppily pouring a bottle of something grain alcohol related into a Sprite bottle. Her hands were shaking so badly I saw the alcohol splash out of the bottle and onto her Casual Corner-issue fur lined jacket. I caught her eye, and she stared at me through the smoked glass as she chugged the first third of her booze. Her way too trendy clothes and hairstyle screamed, 'I'm forty. I swear it!', but the dark spots on her hands put her at fifty, maybe more. They looked even more burdened by the enormous diamond rings slipping off her vodka splashed fingers. Her eyes, carefully ringed in kohl and silver eyeshadow, were ancient and miserable. Society wife gone wild. She peeled away and nearly caught the same curb I did on her way out of the parking lot. As I waited for Jay to come rescue me, I threw around the idea of calling her in for the police. She had out of state vanity tags, so IDing the car wouldn't be any problem, but oh my God what if I ruined her life? She could've been anyone...a CEO, a mother, a minister....what if she got all Law and Order-esque and killed herself after she got a DUI? What if I saved her life? What if I saved someone else's (my) life?

Alcoholism was funny--a story for the next day-- but this lady... I called the cops on her, but the dispatcher seemed bored with it all and in the end I felt horrible. My parents are chaperoning my brother's high school band's semi-annual pilgrimage to Walt Disney World, so when I called them about the tire they had to shout over some Epcot-related calliope music and they didn't understand what I was saying. I think my dad thought I made a citizens' arrest and he said that was stupid. My mom pushed her credit card on me for the tire and begged me to come home and attend a sure-to-be-scandalous wedding in Nevada this weekend. I left them to the Laser and Light Spectacular and sat moping at my computer about being broke and idealistic and misguided and and and... Anyway, I think I'm blogging again. (yay!)",

She got out of the hospital on Saturday with a ton of meds and still got us all together for Easter. I helped as best I could to keep her stress level down and we all ended up having a great time.  BUT, now, my father-in-law, the man my husband loves most in this world is dying from emphysema.  Yesterday morning, I first got a hysterical call from Auntie V, telling me that Jim was dying and would be dead in a few hours. After a few minutes she changed the story to a few days. I called Sharky at work to tell him to call his dad - and reminded/warned him that Auntie V exaggerates most of the time.  Then, I get a call from Della (Jim's wife) telling me that yes, Jim was in the hospital on and off all weekend, but was NOT dying and if he were, SHE would be the one to call us, not an Auntie. So I called Sharky back and told him - much to his relief. Jim was fine, having problems breathing, but had a doctor appointment tomorrow (today).  THEN, I got a call in the afternoon from Piza, Sharky's sister, telling us that he WAS dying. After I explained everything, she started yelling at me accusing me of not caring. Turns out, she had just got off the phone with Della and they were walking out the door to take Jim back to the emergency room at a hospital over an hour away - the local hospitals can't help him anymore. (Like I was supposed to have known that? He sent us an email letting us know, but I received it almost an hour after her call.)  Everything has just gotten worse. I am unfeeling and uncaring because I *gasp* am praying that he will be getting better and not believing that he is dying. I am also mean because I'm not letting Sharky abandon his job and his family to go running up there (his sister and his brother didn't either, but they are better than us). On top of it all, the brother had the balls to tell Sharky that he (Sharky) may not be able to take time off now, but he better after Dad dies. (HUH??? Why is it so important to drop everything to go see a dead body?)  I am so thankful that we had (on and off) three weeks with his dad - Sharky got to spend a lot of time with him and the kids got to too.  We can't afford a plane ticket and we only have the one car. I want Sharky to go up there and see his dad but we can't.  And I am turning out to be the bad guy in all of this.  I understand why the sister and brother have short fuses, but they are quite well off financially compared to us and yet I don't think it's fair for them to demand that Sharky be the one to go up there.  It's hell - we live in NFlorida - and dad is in Michigan. That's a good 24+ hour ride (with no potty breaks). I do want to clarify - it's not that I am not LETTING Sharky go, he can't go. Even if he could leave work - gas=money... But to them, I am nothing but a shrew who won't hock everything she owns...  Do I tell the boys that grandpa is sick? I mean, they know he's sick, but do I tell them he is dying sick? I don't know what to do.  I'm just sitting here waiting for the phone to ring...  I lost my grandmother last year - she was the first person close to me that died. I've had friends and family that died, but it was always far away - nothing close. The pain was excruciating to lose someone so close - grandma was like a mom to me.  I will say something to the boys after school. I don't want to scare them, but I do want them to be prepared. Hopefully, I can follow it up with good news about Grandpa getting better.  The thing is, their hateful comments doesn't really hurt me directly anymore - I've had going on 10 years to get used to it. But it still hurts Sharky when they are mean to him, and that hurts me - that I can't stop his pain. :-(  Update! (FINALLY!)  Dad Jim is doing great. The hospital has his emphysema under control and is balancing all the meds, etc., to make sure he has everything proper. He told Sharky that he really thought he was going to die yesterday.  He also told Sharky how proud he was of me for keeping my cool and attempting to keep everyone else calm and civil. :-)  I feel so much better now. The kids have finished their get-well cards and will put them in the mail tomorrow.  Thank you all for your thoughts and prayers and just listening to me ramble. Sometimes that is all one needs.",

        "blog_text": "There is a point where you feel so small and helpless in an enormous, insane nightmare of a world that you cease to give a hoot and start laughing. This is an edited version of an article first published in Collier's Weekly in August 1944, from The Guardian, Friday May 28, 2004: Refused official permission to join the forces invading France, Martha Gellhorn, who had covered nearly every theatre of the second world war, tricked an official into letting her board a hospital ship. She then locked herself in the vessel's toilet until it set off for Normandy. Unlike her husband, Ernest Hemingway, who was an accredited reporter writing for the same American magazine, Collier's Weekly, she made it to France to produce this dispatch. On her return to England she was arrested by the military police and sent to a nurses' training camp. \nThere was nothing to do now but wait. The big ship felt empty and strange. There were 422 beds covered with new blankets; and a bright, clean, well-equipped operating room, never before used; great cans marked 'Whole Blood' stood on the decks; plasma bottles and supplies of drugs and bales of bandages were stored in handy places. Everything was ready, and any moment we would be leaving for France. \nThe endless varied ships in this invasion port were grey or camouflaged, and they seemed to have the right idea. We, on the other hand, were all fixed up like a sitting pigeon. Our ship was snowy white, with a green line running along the sides below the deck rail, and with many bright new red crosses painted on the hull and painted flat on the boat deck. \nWe were to travel alone. There was not so much as a pistol on board in the way of armament, and neither the English crew nor the American medical personnel had any notion of what happened to large, conspicuous white ships when they appeared in war, though everyone knew the Geneva agreement concerning such ships, and everyone hoped the Germans would take the said agreement seriously. \nThere were six nurses aboard, and they were fine girls. They came from Texas and Michigan and California and Wisconsin, and three weeks ago they were in the USA completing their training for this overseas assignment. They had been prepared to work on a hospital train, which would mean caring for wounded in sensible, steady railway carriages. Now they found themselves on a ship, about to move across the dark water of the Channel. \nThe nurses had worked day and night for two weeks to get this ship ready to receive wounded. They had scrubbed floors and walls, made beds, prepared supplies, and now their work was finished. They went on working, inventing odd jobs to keep busy during these final empty hours before the real work began. But two tired, brave, tough girls sat on a bench inside the hall of the ship, and painted their fingernails with bright red varnish and talked about wanting their mail and worried about their missing footlockers, their valuable footlockers which had in them the vital comfortable shoes and the unvital, probably never-to-be-worn evening dresses. \nOne of the ship's British officers, who had been in the Merchant Marine since the beginning of the war but had never yet set forth in a white ship, came to talk with the girls. He looked tired, and he was vastly amused by their nail polish. 'It would be nice,' he said, 'if we could take that nail polish to London tonight, instead of where we're going.' \nThe tall, pretty nurse held her hands out to see whether the job was well done. 'No,' she said. She was from Texas and spoke in a soft, slow voice. ''No. I'm glad to be going just where I'm going. Don't you know how happy those little old boys are going to be when they see us coming?' \nPulling out of the harbour that night, we passed a Liberty ship going the same way. The ship was grey against the grey water and the grey sky, and standing on her decks, packed solidly together, khaki, silent and unmoving, were American troops. No one waved and no one called. The crowded grey ship and the empty white ship sailed slowly out of the harbour towards France. \nWe crossed by daylight, and the morning seemed longer than other mornings. The captain never left the bridge and, all alone and beautifully white, we made our way through the mine-swept channel. \nThen we saw the coast of France. As we closed in, there was one LCT [landing craft, tank] near us, with washing hung up on a line, and between the loud explosions of mines being detonated on the beach, one could hear dance music coming from its radio. There were barrage balloons, looking like comic toy elephants, bouncing in the high wind above the massed ships, and you could hear invisible planes flying behind the grey ceiling of cloud. Troops were unloading from big ships to heavy barges or to light craft, and on the shore, moving up brown roads that scarred the hillside, our tanks clanked slowly and steadily forward. \nThen we stopped noticing the invasion, the ships, the ominous beach, because the first wounded had arrived. An LCT drew alongside our ship, pitching in the waves. A boy in a steel helmet shouted up to the crew at the aft rail, and a wooden box looking like a lidless coffin was lowered on a pulley, and with the greatest difficulty, bracing themselves against the movement of their boat, the men on the LCT laid a stretcher inside the box. The box was raised to our deck, and out of it was lifted someone who was closer to being a child than a man, dead-white and seemingly dying. The first wounded man to be brought to that ship for safety and care was a German prisoner. \nEverything happened at once. We had six water ambulances - light motor launches that swung down from the ship's side and could be raised the same way when full of wounded. They carried six litter cases apiece, or as many walking wounded as could be crowded into them. Now they were being lowered, with shouted orders: 'That beach over there where they've got streamers up.' \n'Take her in slow ... Those double round things that look like flat spools are mines ... You won't clear any submerged tanks, so look sharp ... Ready? ... Lower her!' \nThe stretcher-bearers, who were part of the American medical personnel, now started on their long, back-breaking job. By the end of that trip, their hands were padded with blisters and they were practically hospital cases themselves. For the wounded had to be got from the shore into our own water ambulances or into other craft, raised over the side, and then transported down the winding stairs of this converted pleasure ship to the wards. The ship's crew became volunteer stretcher-bearers instantly. \nBelow stairs, for three decks, the inside of the ship was a vast ward with double tiers of bunks. The routine of the ship ran marvellously, though four doctors, six nurses and about 14 medical orderlies had to be great people to care for 400 wounded men. From two o'clock one afternoon, until the ship docked in England again the next evening at seven, none of the medical personnel stopped work. And besides plasma and blood transfusions, re-dressing of wounds, examinations, administering of sedatives or opiates or oxygen and all the rest, operations were performed all night long. Only one soldier died on that ship, and he had come aboard a hopeless case. \nIt will be hard to tell you of the wounded, there were so many of them. There was no time to talk; there was too much else to do. They had to be fed as most of them had not eaten for two days; their shoes had to be cut off; they needed help to get out of their jackets; they wanted water; the nurses and orderlies, working like demons, had to be found and called quickly to a bunk where a man suddenly and desperately needed attention; plasma bottles had to be watched; cigarettes had to be lighted and held for those who could not use their hands; it seemed to take hours to pour hot coffee from the spout of a teapot into a mouth that just showed through bandages. \nBut the wounded talked among themselves, and as time went on you got to know them, by their faces and their wounds, not by their names. They were a magnificent, enduring bunch of men. Men smiled who were in such pain that all they really can have wanted to do was turn their heads away and cry, and men made jokes when they needed their strength just to survive. \nAll of them looked after one another, saying, 'Give that boy a drink of water,' or 'Miss, see that ranger over there; he's in bad shape. Could you go to him?' All through the ship, men were asking after other men by name, anxiously, wondering if they were on board and how they were doing. \nOn a deck, in a bunk by the wall, lay a very young lieutenant. He had a bad chest wound, his face was white, and he lay too still. Suddenly he raised himself on his elbow and looked straight ahead of him, as if he did not know where he was. He had a gentle oval face and wide blue eyes and his eyes were full of horror and he did not speak. He had been wounded the first day, had lain out in a field for two days and then crawled back to our lines, sniped at by the Germans. He realised now that a German, badly wounded also in the chest, shoulder and legs, lay in the bunk behind him. The gentle-faced boy said very softly, because it was hard to speak, 'I'd kill him if I could move.' After that he did not speak for a long time; he was given oxygen and later operated on so that he could breathe. \nThe man behind him was a 19-year-old Austrian. He had fought for a year in Russia and half a year in France; he had been home for six days during this time. I thought he would die when he first came on board, but he got better. In the early morning hours he asked whether wounded prisoners were exchanged; would he ever get home again? I told him that I did not know about these arrangements, but that he had nothing to fear. I was not trying to be kind, but only trying to be as decent as the nurses and doctors were. The Austrian said, 'Yes, yes.' Then he added, 'So many men, all wounded, want to get home. Why have we ever fought one another?' Perhaps because he came from a gentler race, his eyes filled up with tears. He was the only wounded prisoner on board who was grateful or polite, who said 'Please' or 'Thank you', or showed any normal human reaction. \nThere was an American soldier on that same deck with a head wound so horrible that he was not moved. Nothing could be done for him, and anything, any touch, would have made him worse. The next morning he was drinking coffee. His eyes looked very dark and strange, as if he had been a long way away, so far away that he almost could not get back. His face was set in lines of weariness and pain, but when asked how he felt, he said he was OK. He was never to say anything more; he asked for nothing and made no complaint. \nOn the next deck, there were many odd and wonderful men, who were less badly wounded and talked more. They talked even when they could not see one another's faces. It was all professional talk: Where they had landed, at what time, what opposition they had met, how they had got out, when they were wounded. \nThey spoke of the snipers, and there was endless talk about the women snipers, none of the talk very clear, but everyone believed it. There had been no French officers with these boys, who could have interpreted, and the Americans never knew what the villagers were saying. \nTwo men who thought they were being invited into an old woman's house to eat dinner were actually being warned of snipers in the attic; they somehow caught on to this fact in time. They were all baffled by the French and surprised by how much food there was in Normandy, forgetting that Normandy is one of the great food-producing areas of France. They thought the girls in the villages were amazingly well dressed. Everything was confused and astounding: first, there were the deadly bleak beaches, and then the villages where they were greeted with flowers and cookies - and often by snipers and booby traps. \nA French boy of 17 lay in one of the bunks; he had been wounded in the back by a shell fragment. He lived and worked on his father's land, but he said the Germans had burned their chateau as they left. Two of the American boys in bunks alongside were worried about him. They were afraid he would be scared, a civilian kid all alone and in pain and not knowing any English and going to a strange country. But the French boy was very much a man and very tight-lipped. He kept his anxiety inside himself, though it showed in his eyes. His family was still there in the battle zone, and he did not know what had happened to them or how he would ever get back. The American soldiers said, 'You tell that kid he's a better soldier than that Boche in the bunk next to him.' \nWe did not like this Boche, who was 18 and blond and the most demanding of the 'master' race aboard. Finally there was a crisp little scene when he told the orderly to move him, as he was uncomfortable, and the orderly said no, he would bleed if moved. \nWhen I explained, the German said angrily, 'How long, then, am I to lie here in pain in this miserable position?' \nI asked the orderly what to say, and the orderly answered, 'Tell him there are a lot of fine boys on this ship lying in worse pain in worse positions.' \nThe American soldiers in the bunks around said, 'What a Heinie!' wearily, and then they began wondering how they would find their old units again and how soon they would get mail. \nWhen night came, the water ambulances were still churning in to the beach looking for wounded. Someone on an LCT had shouted out that there were maybe a hundred scattered along there somewhere. It was essential to try to get them aboard before the nightly air raid and before the dangerous dark cold could get into their hurt bodies. \nGoing in to shore, unable to see, and not knowing this tricky strip of water, was slow work. Two of the launch crew, armed with boathooks, hung over the side of the boat and stared at the black water, looking for obstacles, sunken vehicles or mines, and they kept the hooks ready to push us off the sand as we came closer in. For the tides were a nasty business, too. Part of the time, wounded had to be ferried out to the water ambulances on men's shoulders, and part of the time the water ambulances grounded and stuck on the beach together with other craft, stranded by the fast-moving sea. \nWe finally got on to a barge near the beach. The motor ambulance could not come inshore near enough to be of any use at this point, so we looked for a likelier anchorage farther down. We waded ashore, in water to our waists, having agreed that we would assemble the wounded from this area on board a beach LCT and wait until the tide allowed the motor ambulance to come back and call for us. It was almost dark by now, and one had a terrible feeling of working against time. \nEveryone was violently busy on that crowded, dangerous shore. The pebbles were the size of apples and several feet deep, and we stumbled up a road that a huge road shovel was scooping out. We walked with the utmost care between the narrowly placed white tape lines that marked the mine-cleared path, and headed for a tent marked with a red cross. \nDucks and tanks and trucks were moving down this narrow rocky road, and one stepped just a little out of their way, but not beyond the tapes. The dust that rose in the grey night light seemed like the fog of war itself. Then we got off on to the grass, and it was perhaps the most surprising of all the day's surprises to smell the sweet smell of summer grass, a smell of cattle and peace and the sun that had warmed the earth some other time, when summer was real. \nInside the Red Cross tent there were two tired, unshaven, dirty, polite young men who said that the trucks were coming in here with the wounded, and where did we want to have them unloaded. We explained the problem of the tides and said the best thing was to run the trucks down to that LCT there and carry the wounded aboard, under the canvas roof covering, and we would get them off as soon as anything floated. \nThe Red Cross men said they didn't know whether wounded would be coming in all night or not; it was tough to transport them by road in the dark; anyway, they would send everything down to our agreed meeting place, and everyone said, 'Well, good luck, fella,' and we left. No one wasted time talking around here. You had a feeling of fierce and driven activity. \nWe returned to our small, unattractive piece of the beach and directed the unloading of a truck. The tide was coming in, and there was a narrow strip of water between the landing ramp of the LCT and the shore. The wounded were carried carefully and laid on the deck inside the great whale's-mouth cavern of the LCT. After that, there was a pause, with nothing to do. \nSome American soldiers came up and began to talk. This had been an ugly piece of beach from the beginning, and they were still here, living in foxholes and supervising the uploading of supplies. They spoke of snipers in the hills a hundred yards or so behind the beach, and no one lighted a cigarette. They spoke of not having slept at all, but they seemed curiously pleased by the discovery that you could go without sleep and food and still function all right. Everyone agreed that the beach was a stinker, and that it would be a great pleasure to get the hell out of here some time. \nThen there was our favourite American conversation: 'Where're you from?' An American always has time to look for someone who knows his home town. We talked about Pittsburgh and Rosemont, Pennsylvania, Chicago and Cheyenne, not saying much except that they were swell places and had this beach licked every way for Sunday. Then one of the soldiers remarked that they had a nice foxhole about 50 yards inland and we were very welcome there, when the air raid started, if we didn't mind eating sand. \nMy companion, one of the stretcher-bearers from the ship, thanked them for their kind invitation and said that, on the other hand, we had guests aboard the LCT and we would have to stay home this evening. I wish I had known his name, because I would like to write it down here. He was one of the best and jolliest boys I've met any place, any time. He joked, no matter what happened, and toward the end of that night, we really began to enjoy ourselves. There is a point where you feel yourself so small and helpless in such an enormous, insane nightmare of a world, that you cease to give a hoot about anything and you renounce care and start laughing. He was lovely company, that boy was, and he was brave and competent, and I wish I had known his name. \nHe went off to search for the water ambulances and returned to say that there wasn't a sign of them, which meant that they couldn't get inshore yet and we would just have to wait and hope they could find this spot when it was black night. If they never found this place, the LCT would float later, and the British captain said he would run our wounded out to the hospital ship, though it would not be for hours. \nSuddenly our flak started going up at the far end of the beach, and it was very beautiful, twinkling as it burst in the sky, and the tracers were as lovely as they always are; and no one took pleasure from the beauty of the scene. 'We've had it now,' said the stretcher-bearer. 'There isn't any place we can put those wounded.' I asked one of the soldiers, just for interest's sake, what they did in case of air raids, and he said well, you could go to a foxhole if you had time, but on the other hand, there really wasn't much to do. So we stood and watched, and there was altogether too much flak for comfort. We could not hear the planes or any bomb explosions, but, as everyone knows, flak is a bad thing to have fall on your head. \nThe soldiers now drifted off on their own business, and we boarded the LCT to keep the wounded company. The stretcher-bearer and I said to each other gloomily that, as an air-raid shelter, far better things than the hold of an LCT had been devised, and we went inside, not liking any of it, and feeling miserably worried about our wounded. \nThe wounded looked pretty bad and lay very still. In the light of one bare bulb, which hung from a girder, one could not see them well. Then one of them began to moan, and he said something. He was evidently conscious enough to notice this ghastly racket that was going on above us. The Oerlikons of our LCT now opened fire, and the noise inside the steel hold was as if they were driving rivets into your eardrums. The wounded man called out again, and I realised that he was speaking German. \nWe checked up, then, and found that we had an LCT full of wounded Germans, and the stretcher-bearer said, 'Well, that's just dandy! By golly, if that isn't the pay-off!' Then he said, 'If anything hits this ship, dammit, they deserve it.' However, there were still the English crew and ourselves aboard and it seemed a rather expensive poetic justice. \nThe ack-ack lifted a bit, and the stretcher-bearer climbed up to the upper deck, like Sister Anne on the tower, to see where those water ambulances were. I clambered like a very awkward monkey up a ladder to the galley to get some coffee and so missed the spectacle of two German planes falling like fiery comets from the sky. They hit the beach to the right and left of us and burned in huge bonfires which lighted up the shore. \nThe beach, in this light, looked empty of human life, cluttered with dark square shapes of tanks and trucks and jeeps and ammunition boxes and all the motley equipment of war. It looked like a vast, uncanny black-and-red-flaring salvage dump. \nOur LCT crew was delighted because they believed they had brought down one of the German planes, and everyone felt cheerful about the success of the ack-ack. A soldier shouted from shore that we had shot down four planes in all and it was nice work. The wounded were very silent, and those few who had their eyes open had very frightened eyes. They seemed to be listening with their eyes, and fearing what they could hear. \nThe night, too, went on longer than other nights. Our water ambulances found us, and there was a lot of incomprehensible cockney talk among the boatmen while the wounded were loaded from the now floating LCT to the small, bucking launch. We set out, happy because we were off the beach and because the wounded would be taken where they belonged. \nThe trip across that obstacle-studded piece of water was a chatty affair, due to the boat crew. 'Crikey, mate, wot yer trying ter do? Ram a destroyer?' And, 'By God, man, keep an eye in yer head! That's a tank radio pole.' To which another answered, 'Ye expect me to see a bloody piece of grass in this dark?' So, full of conversation, we zigzagged back to the ship and were at last swung aboard. \nThe American medical personnel, most of whom had never been in an air raid, tranquilly continued their work, asked no questions, showed no sign of even interest in this uproar, and handed out confidence as if it were a solid thing like bread. If I seem to insist too much in my admiration for these people, understand that one cannot insist too much. There is a kind of devotion, coupled with competence, which is almost too admirable to talk about; and they had all of it that can be had. \nIf anyone had come fresh to that ship in the night, someone unwounded, not attached to the ship, he would probably have been appalled. It began to look very Black Hole of Calcutta, because it was airless and ill-lit. Piles of bloody clothing had been cut off and dumped out of the way in corners; coffee cups and cigarette stubs littered the decks, plasma bottles hung from cords, and all the fearful surgical apparatus for holding broken bones made shadows on the walls. \nThere were wounded who groaned in their sleep or called out, and there was the soft, steady hum of conversation among the wounded who could not sleep. That is the way it would have looked to anyone seeing it fresh; a ship carrying a load of pain, with everyone waiting for daylight, everyone longing for England. \nIt was that, but it was something else, too; it was a safe ship, no matter what happened to it. We were together and we counted on one another. We knew that from the British captain to the pink-cheeked London messboy, every one of the ship's company did his job tirelessly and well. The wounded knew that the doctors and nurses and orderlies belonged to them utterly and would not fail them. And all of us knew that our wounded men were good men, and with their amazing help, their selflessness and self-control, we would get through all right. \nThere is very little more to write. The wounded looked much better in the morning. The human machine is the most delicate and rare of all, and it is obviously built to survive, if given half the chance. The ship moved steadily across the Channel, and we could feel England coming nearer. Then the coast came into sight, and the green of England looked quite different from how it had looked only two days ago: it looked cooler and clearer and wonderfully safe. The air of England flowed down through the wards, and the wounded seemed to feel it. The sound of their voices brightened and sharpened, and they began making dates with one another for when they would be on convalescent leave in London. The captain shouted down from the bridge, 'Look at it! Just look at it!' He was too proud of the navy - his navy and ours - to say more. But he had spoken, in his pride, for all of us. \nAmerican ambulance companies were waiting on the pier, the same efficient, swift troops I had seen on the piers and landing ramps before we left. There were conferences on the quay between important shore personages and our captain and chief medical officer; and a few of us, old-timers by now, leaned over the rail and joked about being back in the paperwork department again. Everyone felt very happy and fine, and you could see it in their faces. The head nurse, smiling though grey with weariness, said, 'We'll do it better next time,' which seemed to me to be a very elegant thing to say. \nAs the first wounded were carried from the ship, the chief medical officer watching them said, 'Made it.' That was the great thing. Now they would restock their supplies, clean the ship, cover the beds with fresh blankets, sleep whatever hours they could, and then they would go back to France. But this trip was done; this much was to the good; they had made it. \nThis is an edited version of an article first published in Collier's Weekly in August 1944.  For more read here",

Never happen, and you may have just missed an incredibly important creative moment.  Who knows.  Or, '[Sigh], again?'  That's the guilt trip.    These complaints are not always in the form of words either.  Sometimes it's just a look that says it all.  But the lack of empathy outsiders have towards our art is not intentional.  It's just impossible for them to understand how relentless, yet fleeting creative juices can be.  They don't know what it's like to be woken up in the middle of the night by an idea that has to be put down on paper.  They take it personally when you are totally distracted during 'quality time' because you're just not satisfied with that last piece you rushed to finish in order to be with your significant other.    That's the paradox we have to live with.  You're damned if you take more creative time and interfere with the 'quality time.'  And you're creation is damned if you cheat the creative time for the benefit of the 'quality time.'  Artistry is a beautiful burden, and we are slaves to its sadism.  It's a love that burns icy hot because it provides a soothing escape from 'reality,' yet can only be shared once complete.    Of course, then we have the joyous pain of letting our love go ... until we fall in love with our next text.   SerialThriller.com",

        "blog_text": "Every day I find someone who is on an amazing journey of self-discovery.  The nice part is, many of them are willing to make an open record of their journeys for the world.  Here's a good one.   It reminds me that I have been neglecting my own blog, either not publishing or publishing drivel, when I could be writing deep, spiritual, meaningful posts.  Well, I ask the reader to bear with me.  I had thought about having a theme for this blog, such as my shamanic work or my philosophy.  But then it would only be a log of part of my journey, not the entire journey.  So, take it as it comes, stream of consciousness.  WYSIWYG, gentle reader.  You get the deep thoughts, the silly humor, perhaps the occasional raunchy sex fantasy.  And the gaps when my regular life is moving too fast to keep a log.  It's all me.  I used to be a writer.  I did not become a writer because I love writing.  I learned at an early age I love to explore.  I love learning, and enjoyed college and law school immensely.  But more than mere learning, I love discovery, finding something that no one has ever known before, or that was once known but long lost.  At first I thought I should become a scientist.  In high school I realized that discoveries in nature were fascinating, but human nature was even more mysterious than the heart of darkest Africa, the deep ocean trenches, or even outer space.  Of course, that's the irony of Gene Roddenberry's vision,  Star Trek :  The 'final frontier' is not space, but the human soul.  And, of course, that was the main theme of the series.  The  Enterprise  even looks like a stick figure, like something painted on the wall of a cave, if you look at the outline from above/below.  So I thought that being a writer or poet would be a good way to explore the human soul (priest, psychologist, lawyer--those are good, too).  But becoming a lawyer, becoming a writer, was for me becoming what Julia Cameron in  The Artist's Way  called a 'shadow artist.'  A shadow artist is one who does not pursue his art, but compensates by picking something in the general ballpark.  I was handed that book by a good friend when I expressed to her that I was dissatisfied with being a writer.  One of the challenges I faced in deciding to just be an explorer, to do nothing more, and nothing less, than exploring the human heart, without trying to put an established label on it, was the fear, What if I succeed in discovering great things about the soul, but no one ever knows?  What's the point?  What difference does it make?  Why make the effort?  And it is effort.  Faulkner called it 'the agony and sweat of the human spirit.'  I ultimately left that in God's hands (or that's how my mother would put it).  Or rather, I just made the assumption, as an initial premise, that somehow it would serve a purpose.  I did not need to keep a record, and I did not need to accomplish something, put it to use.  I am purely a theoretician.  It is for others to find whether what I discover can be made useful.  For me, the discovery alone is enough.  Nor is this blog a complete record.  For one thing, quite some time passed between the decision to explore and my starting this blog, and quite a lot of travelling occurred in the meantime, that you, reader, have not yet heard about (shamanism, bone marrow disease, etc).  Nor, despite what I wrote above, is this blog a complete account of my journey, a complete picture of me.  Rather it is a random snapshot of a vignette, a small slice, of me, taken now and again.  But in allowing the randomicity, in avoiding any self-selection, any filtering, I hope to give you a representative sample.",

Write a journal entry about it.  It would be easy to say that I realized I was an adult when I graduated High School or turned eighteen, though it would be a lie.  As I look back and consider the events of my life thus far, I would say that I realized I was an adult not when I married for the first time but when I divorced.  Divorce is something that marks you, something you remember for the whole of your life.    When I was a sophomore in high school I started dating Mike, it was August 94.  He was a good guy, and we really enjoyed one another's company.  We had a good time together, he started living with my family - his parents were divorced.  We spent a good deal of time together, which eventually led to our first big fight in December 94, only four months after we started dating.  This of course led to years of fighting, nearly non-stop.  We had several good years together, got engaged in February 96, graduated high school in May 96, and began to plan our wedding.  We got married in July 98 and as I look back now I realize that it was the worst mistake I have ever made.  When the day came, I did not want to do it, yet I felt that there was no going back so I closed my eyes and jumped.  We began to fight almost immediately, and after the wedding he hit me several times.  I put a stop to that, yet we were still living with my parents and we were pretty unhappy.  I had just turned 20.    In November of 98 we began looking for a house, still not getting along yet feeling that we would be more settled and content if we were on our own.  I didn't want to buy a house, Mike did.  I wanted to rent an apartment, he said no.  So we bought a house in December 98 and moved in around Christmas time. The fighting did not even come close to stopping.  Immature as I was, immature as he was, the fighting went on.  Many late night fights later I told him that if something didn't change I was leaving by June, it was January 97.  Nothing changed and I met someone new.  No, I didn't leave Mike for Matt; I left Mike for my sanity and piece of mind.  Matt was there for me and we forged a bond.  Mike had caused me years of therapy for problems that he caused me to have, I just couldn't take it anymore.  Mike and I divorced in June of 99, 11 months after our wedding, one month shy of our first anniversary.  It was a fight from the word divorce.  He refused to let me go and I refused to allow him to make me stay.  Two weeks of pain ensued and when it finally rang, I was free of him forever.  He paid for the divorce and I moved to Texas.  I don't remember crying once; it was all a big relief to be through with the fighting and pain that he had caused me for the 5 years we were together.  No, I take it back, I cried once.  It was not because I was sad that we wouldn't be together anymore.  I knew instantly that I was depressed that though I knew when I married him that I didn't want to, I had forged myself into one of the hoarding masses of divorcees; I had turned myself into a statistic. In 1999 42% of marriages ended in divorce, I was just one of the 42%.  It was a real eye opener.    Bam! Adulthood, not an easy transition from the immaturity of childhood to the fully awake realization that you're an adult and there is no one there to catch you.  For me it was as if the safety net that my parents had been removed, replaced by a million-foot drop to the oblivion of the years ahead.  Suddenly everything looked so damn different and I told myself that I would never marry another man, so help me God!  I moved to Texas and in with Matt.  1,500 miles away from my family, I was an adult.  Matt had made it clear to me that he didn't believe in marriage, I had told him that was good because I would jump from an airplane with no parachute before I would tie myself to another man with a little gold band and a rock.  I just wasn't for me, marriage I mean.  Welcome to adulthood.  I was wrong yet again, Matt and I married in February of 2000 and we have been married for nearly four years. He and I are very happy together and we intend to be for a very long time.  So, while my adulthood came with a price tag that was more than I had bargained for, I lived, most of us do.  I wouldn't wish my experience on anyone, though I can't help feeling like tough experiences forge us into better adults.   ~Kristyn",

It's odd to my that now that I can actually see the end of my schooling days (spring of '05) I find myself enjoying it more then I ever have in my life. Before class we were required to read Now, Discover your Strengths, an interesting book that essentially says we should focus on our strengths instead of always trying to fix our imperfections. Andy Stanley talks about this same idea in Next Generation Leader (a must read by the way), but this book fleshes it out more and gives you tools to identify your strengths. The concept is good and something I’m going to try and work harder at implementing in my life. Most of the class however was focused developing our personal calling statement. This is a three part process that combines your Biblical purpose Statement, your core Values and Your personal Vision Statement. I absolutely loved this process because it allowed me to really sort through where I’m headed. My position with the association ends in December so I have to decide what I’m going to do when I’m done.

These 15 girls stole my heart.  I never dreamed that could be possible to this extent.  I figured I'd become fond of them but it goes way beyond that.  I will really miss them.  I'd never taught this age group before last summer when I was recruited to help with Learning to Lead camp at ACU during one week in the summer. And then I signed on more or less as crowd control to backup a friend and her daughter with a group of 20 kids going into 6th grade.  My ulterior motive was to get my own son to go.  The morning of day 4 I got a call from said friend who informed me that her daughter had kidney stones and they'd been at the hospital all night.  I was on my own.  I nearly panicked and then I remembered God was in control.  I decided to trust Him.  It was such a blessing.  I learned alot about listening and hearing God, trusting and obeying and the incredible sense of relief and comaraderie and no-longer-aloneness one can feel when you do listen, hear, trust and obey.  It gave me the confidence to walk up to Diane Cope's car one day at soccer practice and say without thinking, 'Hey Diane, if you ever need help in the 6th grade girls class, I'd be willing.'  (Willingness is another huge lesson I'm learning and have come a long way developing.)  I walked away and 20 minutes later my whole life changed.  It seems she was sitting in the car praying that God would show her who He wanted to be in there helping her teach.  One of her teachers had decided to move on and the other was pregnant and would need some time off.  So she was pretty much blown away by my offhanded suggestion.  She came up to me sitting in my lawn chair and asked if I really meant it.  I said, 'sure I guess so.'  And the rest is, as they say, is History.  Diane has told me several times throughout this past year that this is where I am supposed to be.  It has been fun.  It has been insightful.  It has been challenging.  It has been moving.  I'll have a hard time letting these 15 girls go.  I'll miss each one of them.  God has used them to change my life and the way I think of myself and of Him.  I will never be the same.

It was taken in front of the John Wayne statue at Long Beach Airport (John Wayne Airport), on my first trip to California ever. At the time, we lived in Phoenix, having been recently transplanted from Chicago.     It was a simple family vacation; we did the touristy stuff like Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, the Queen Mary/Spruce Goose, and Huntington Beach. I remember it as a good trip for those things, but mostly I remember it as the first time I was ever in love with a place. Standing at baggage claim, I looked at the differently-dressed people, I felt the moist air and saw the colors of California. I was hooked. I loved Southern California on sight as much as I had hated Phoenix two years earlier. I can still run the images through my brain like a movie reel. There's a clip looking out our rental car window from the 405 freeway, getting lost. A shot out of the porthole in our stateroom on the Queen Mary. Sorting through postcards on the bed in Dana Point. Standing on the beach, looking out at endless blue water. All the cars, tons of cars everywhere. At some point, I made up my mind that I would live in that place someday. Since then I've lived in lots of places, and some of them have felt like home. My first glimpse of Germany felt that way, and so does Chicago still. But no place gave me the feeling that I belonged somewhere like Southern California did. I had never really belonged anywhere up to the time of that trip. I just read another article that blasts California and takes the usual potshots at the traffic, the hodegpodge architecture, and the vast spread of Los Angeles County. I can't deny that traffic gives me a headache just like anyone else, and 2nd Street between Figueroa and Larchmont isn't exactly a string of Parisian Boulangeries. But something connects me to this place and makes me feel as if I was meant to come here. The beach in Malibu, the trendy cafes in Los Feliz and the galleries in Laguna Nigel definitely outweigh the potholes in Historic Philipinotown. Looking at myself in the mirror, I still see the kid who got stuck on a place and never forgot to come back. Then I look at this photo and I see the kid who had no idea what his life would be, only that he wanted some part of it spent where he was standing right at that moment. Yeah, it's weird to look at a photo and know what you were thinking at the time. But I do. It's hard to see behind the goofy glasses and the hair, but the kid in the knit tie is having a religious experience.",

However, lately, it seems that guilt is dissolving to disillusionment and idealism is beginning to have less and less appeal.  The result is this:  I have come to the not-so original conclusion that what the country needs is not free choice, but an educated one.  The ramifications of this conclusion are numerous, but perhaps what is the most controversial of all is that in my own envisioned restoration of the country, I believe that  people with no high school degree should not be allowed to vote .  I can pinpoint a thousand reasons how such a regulation could be abused to the detriment of the less fortunate, but I believe, if used wisely, it would be the best and only alternative to reconstruct our broken nation.  And by wisely, I imagine it being done under the premise that:  1)The majority of the educated would not withhold education from those who weren’t so lucky.   2)The educated have jobs 3)The educated would be less likely to be led around the noose by the glitter of stardom and promises of short term gratification 4)It assumes that in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the educated have at least satisfied the first two levels and would less likely to be ruled by the basic needs  I, of all people, do not want to withhold a right to choose a government simply because they weren’t fortunate enough to finish high school.  But I also believe that when you are near starvation, food and shelter are so scarce, you’d believe the flashiest promises from the people you think you know through their movie/tv personas.  I also believe that long term goals are difficult to determine and assess when you don’t even know when your next meal will be.  While having a high-school diploma does not guarantee all the above (it doesn’t even guarantee having a job), at least it gives me some assurance that these people went through basic economics, basic math, and basic history.  Just like we require voters to be 18 years old, of sound mind and body, I believe that having a diploma assures some level of maturity and knowledge, and not just desperate hopes from a person who don’t and can’t see the bigger picture due to unfortunate limitations.  But then, that’s just me.  Cynical, but still hoping me.  I keep thinking someday, I’ll stop feeling guilty at all and probably loose some of my so-called humanity.  But as one colorful character in Babylon 5 said, these are insane times.  And you must learn to embrace your insanity.   I'm beginning to see the true logic in that.",

I wrestle with guilt over the potential for discrimination, but ultimately, I feel compelled by logic and my hope for a better future to propose this controversial solution.",

For some reason I'm still mourning over the fact that I didn't make it into Algebra 2, I studied hard and did all I could to succeed. I tried to ask for help and all that good stuff. I mean I went into that test confident that I was going to pass and hear Mrs. Brennan say those all powerful and satisfying words to me ' Alonzo you will be in Algebra 2' but no the words never passed her lips. I asked her 'Did I pass the test?' she she boldly with not regret replied instantly ' No you didn't but I'll show you your test Wednesday.' I don't know anybody that wanted to be in Algebra 2 as much as I did. I mean, it meant so much to me. ( believe it or not I'm crying right now because of this) Because I had set in my mind that I was going to prove to all those people in that classroom that I was as smart as they were maybe not smarter but at least as smart as them. But no the only thing I thought I was great at, which was academics, failed me. Sometimes I wish I were never born and then I wouldn't have to deal with having to get F's and be critisized because I read slower than other people and that I don't catch on to things as well as others. And to see everybody else move on like Chichi, Sonya, LinZ, and all the rest of my friends, to see them happy makes me feel like I shouldn't even be considered their friend. Someties I feel like I'm there for comfort and I'm just a guy who is sure who he is and nobody can figure that out but me and only me. and the fact that I am still crying makes me feel even worse because I don't like to show my weaknesses to the world and I consider academic failure  a weakness. Even though I always joked about getting F's on my algebra tests on the inside I was crying because I was never used to get bad grades and I hated it and I felt like I was letting my whole family down because I was considered the smart one the one that gets the best grades, the one that was destined to be something great, but on the inside I'm just some kind that thinks he's actually has the talent to be a veterinarian or a zoologist although I am allergic to cat and dog dander. I never thought that my feelings were this deep and if I think that the only reason I am on this earth is for failure to succeed then I am just making myself feel worse but. Like I always say everything happens for a reason, but what reason is there for the only hope that I had to prove to myself and to others that I actually was smart to be crushed like an ant that is smash by a curious child? I mean I really don't know what's wrong with me, I'm crying over a stupid test that I took 3 maybe 4 months ago, but the reason for this drama is because Mrs. Brennan made the test seem larger than life itself, like it I passed this test I would be proud of myself and actually have an ounces of confidence that I would actually do something good in my life, but instead I failed a test that means so much to me and confidence levels drowns in a pitch black abyss of failure to succeed and prove to myself who I am and who I will be. And then when my friends comfort me I say that I'm fine when in actuality I am lying to them because they made me feel good for maybe 30 minutes and then all of those feeling come tumbling down on me again. I just feel like a complete and TOTAL IDIOT to think that my unimportant exsistance would actually mean something to all of those people out there. I just to tell myself that I was useless, worthless, and invisible to the world, well what do you know my past has come back to haunt me, and all I feel is pain because I have failed my family and my friends because they are reading this and then they feel like they have to comfort me and try to make me feel better.

        "blog_text": "It’s 11:15 in the morning, and my stomach and head are at war. It’s Day One of Phase One of the South Beach Diet revisited, which means I’m on a strict, imbibe-no-crap regimen. It’s also the day we take my co-worker to lunch for her birthday. The Birthday Lunch is a ritual that began when people lived in caves. You can see it on the walls at Lascaux – the piercing eyes of stick figure cavemen imploring, asking the birthday caveman how his mastodon tastes. He responds with a tentative grunt, self-conscious, polite. They make small talk and navigate uncomfortable pauses by taking keen interest in their food. Later, there’s cake. \nApparently, we have not progressed. The co-worker assigned to round up the troops lets us know the Birthday Lady has decided on Olive Garden. \nOlive Garden. \nOlive Garden, where I can eat exactly one thing on the menu, the Chicken Caesar Salad, and watch the rest of my table feed on sumptuous-smelling breadsticks. Olive Garden, where they serve you salad family style before bringing your meal, which means I will eat redundantly, salad followed by salad. Olive Garden, where the A/C is cranked to nipple-hardening, lip-numbing temperatures, where they bring you full glasses of iced tea rather than just fill your half-filled glass, leading you to feel a contractual obligation to drink more tea, where you are indeed a pawn in some waiter’s kill-the-lunchtime-boredom game of Customer Iced Tea Drinking Races, where the waiter will mention I look tired at lunch when, really, I look ripped-off and petulant, the result of being dragged, not exactly against my will but not exactly out of instinctual, let’s-eat-there impulse, to Olive Garden. \nThey seat seven of us at a ten-top and won’t seat us at the eight-top the next table over because that’s the “training section.” This means we are assuredly in the hands of professionals. Our professional waiter saunters over, suggestive-sells us drinks (we decline), suggestive-sells us appetizers (we decline), and hands us menus, thinking us cheap and unfestive, which is not altogether inaccurate. \nI look at the menu, scan the items, confirming the worst. Carboload. Carbomax. Carblicious. Carbohydrate Surprise. Carb To My Lou. Carbeteria. Chicken Caesar Salad. Defeatedly, I place my order, and settle into a randomly-firing conversation about negligent boyfriends, mundane vacation spots, and death. \nNo matter how witty your co-workers, no matter how much lemon butter is drizzled over the main course chicken, no matter how quick and efficient your waiter, Birthday Lunch is the Hindenburg of lunch dates. If you live in an office with politics, they will edge the bare spots in conversation and poke through like weeds to sidewalks. If you cannot speak frankly and openly under the fluorescent lights of your office, you are doomed to fail under the non-descript light of a chain restaurant. \nTempers will flare. Envy will lick its lips and look for a hand mirror. Ennui will take a silent roll through the gates in a giant wooden horse. Birthday Lunch will make you pine for other discomforting engagements, like College Reunion Karaoke Night, or Acquaintance Strip Club Bachelor Party, or Obscure Relative Closed-Casket Funeral. \nAnd then, later, there’s cake. \nIf you are dieting, cake means watching other people eat cake. It means singing-in-public punishment and then declining cake reward. It means wearing a forced smile and drinking from a comically-oversized glass of water in a valiant effort to feel full, compliments on your willpower, tsk-tsk chiding from those who can’t resist pointing out, “You don’t know what you’re missing,” when, in fact, you do. It means 15 minutes of conversation with the entire office as difficult to predict as roulette. Could be boredom, could be agitation, could be earnestly funny and the highlight of the work day, could be harrowing cryptic precursor to layoffs and reassignments and general work-related doom. \nAt the point in the proceedings you wish your parents were there, so you could ask to be excused from the table, you may beg off and return your cubicle and let your email and your homepage of choice and your personalized screensaver soothe you back into the space that is no longer shared, to the refreshing consolation that though no man is an island, sometimes, you get to be relatively close to an island – perhaps, an isthmus. \nAnd, if you are like me, you know that sometime in the next 364 days, the discomfort of the Birthday Lunch will be on your behalf. And if you are like me, you can’t predict the level of angst or boredom or restless fuss that will tether itself to your day. But you will know, at least, that you will have your pick of restaurants, and one guess as to where you won’t be dragging the rest of the office.",

I know there are many people close to me who, like me, would not be the unique and thoughtful individuals they are today if not for some of the trials they endured and subsequently learned from.    Personally, I have worked toward getting my intellect and emotion on par through lots and lots of therapy.  Therapy really helps me to make the connection between those two facets of myself, and helps me to see the enlightenment I can obtain through my painful experiences, instead of just wallowing in the so-called cosmic injustice.  I could say that all the emotional battery I endured from my peers growing up was unfair, unjust, wrong, and nothing but bruises and scars on my psyche.  But somehow my downward spiral to the bottom of my emotional barrel showed me that I can go up, that if I want to keep living, I have no CHOICE but to go up.  And my intellectual side has made that upward journey a lot easier.  It's wonderful when you start to transform your pain and anger into joy.  It's not always easy, but damn it feels good when you get there.  I may not be able to do it every day, but I'm getting better and better the more I practice.  And it makes appreciating the simple yet immense joys of life and love so much easier and necessary.  I spend a good portion of my day in a state of humility and gratitude for my past pains, because I honestly believe that I would not know the joy I know today without them.    And having been to the bottom and back, when you come out on the other side, suddenly your priorities are so much more clear.  Losing everything emotionally helps you so much to realize what's truly important to you, if you allow yourself to reflect on the loss with more of a sense of evaluation and new perspective than in anger and resentment for having had to lose everything in the first place.  I slip sometimes, especially when I'm hormonal, so that's why I continue to go to therapy...because it keeps me in check about what's really important, especially when I start to fret about silly incidental things like my weight and my daily stress at work, things that at first seem overwhelming, but, in the big picture, are nearly meaningless.

In a climate of moral relativism where – ‘you have your values and I have mine’ codifying values is seen as a solution. Imposed codes of ethics, however, have the capacity to create an environment where more and more restrictions are required. Real freedom comes out of a voluntary acceptance of a shared and universally accepted ethic not imposed codes of ethics and conduct.  As a Christian school we would find it morally offensive, culturally insensitive, and professionally unacceptable to be in a position where Christian teachers in our school were required to sign such a code of ethics.  There are three main grounds for our strongly held objections: \n1. Commitment to Truth.  At the heart of any code of ethics is a concern with ‘what is right, fair, just or good.’  The draft document correctly points out that ‘sets of values or principles…. may or may not be the same as those of each individual in the profession.’  As Christians and as a Christian school we are committed to a Biblical worldview where God is Truth and He has laid down absolutes and precepts that are not negotiable. In teaching a Christian worldview we believe that any instruction that does not begin with the fear of the Lord, and the centrality of Jesus Christ as the basis for understanding all of life, cannot properly be said to impart truth, wisdom or true knowledge.  Secular schools (the vast majority of schools in NZ) by their very nature exclude God as the author of truth, instead place man at the centre where he becomes the meaning maker of truth and the arbiter of what is right and wrong.  In other words a humanist worldview prevails in most of our schools where truth is viewed as evolving and ever changing according to what pleases man. In the draft code of ethics under the heading ‘The principle of truth’ it states that teachers are to be ‘committed to the quest for truth however elusive and provisional that might be..’  For the Christian teacher this is religiously offensive and competes with our God’s claim that He is Truth. Man does not define or construct truth he only discovers what God has already declared as true.  A commitment to God’s truth as revealed in His Word is very much a part of what it means to be a Christian teacher in our school. To have to adhere to or sign any code of ethics that does not acknowledge this would be both culturally and religiously offensive to us.  Paul Rishworth, associate professor of law at Auckland University, correctly highlights some of the dangers by asking the question ‘where does the freedom of belief and expression for teachers intersect with legitimate interests of the school?’  I would add another question – whose view of truth is being upheld?   Rishworth presents a number of possible scenarios; one in particular of topical interest, regarding a teacher who outside of class is a Moslem spokesman making statements in support of Al Qaeda. Applying a code of ethics becomes problematic. The dilemma of cultural pluralism is whose truth is being promoted and whose worldview is acceptable.  Each teacher in our school signs a Statement of Faith where they unreservedly accept and promise to uphold the precepts detailed in the document as a testimony of their belief, and a declaration of a personal faith in Jesus Christ as their Saviour, Lord and God. Every teacher, is, if you like, bound by God’s Word (code) and His declaration that He is Truth.  \n2. Morally Offensive \nYour attached abridged article by Hall and Bishop ‘Teacher Ethics, Professionalism and Cultural Diversity’ states that ‘effective teaching requires both technical skill and a moral purpose.’  Here is a statement that, I like most people, am readily able to endorse. Where the difficulty and offence lies is with the presumption that the ‘moral purpose’ of all schools is the same. To imply that our Christian School has the same moral purpose, as any state school, is to ignore the very reason why private schools like ours were set up in the first place. We do not teach the state school curriculum; rather we teach a curriculum based on a Christian biblical worldview. A common code of ethics seeks to suggest that we have the same moral and religious purpose as all other schools. This is incorrect as well as being both morally and religiously offensive to us.  \n3. Professionally Unacceptable \nThe draft code of ethics is professionally unacceptable to our Christian teachers on at least two counts. As alluded to above, our primary aim in Christian education is fundamentally different from that of secular schools. Under the heading ‘Learner Identity’ in the attached paper by Hall and Bishop, the primary goal of education is stated as ‘the achievement of rational autonomy and self determination’.  Our goals are very different. As a Christian school we aim to honour God as we help parents nurture and teach their children within a biblical framework. Our primary goal is to prepare a new generation of effective, strong, mature Christians able to give godly leadership influencing our culture and society for Christ.  Secondly for our Christian school to be bound by a code of ethics that sets out to ‘define the boundaries of professional obligation’ within a secular framework is again culturally and religiously offensive to us. I suggest that we have a totally different understanding as to the role and function of a Christian teacher in our school.  The Christian teacher is first and foremost to be a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. In his capacity as a teacher his service to God is paramount. The teacher is to serve the parents of pupils who under God have been entrusted to him. He is to love and serve the pupils being a Christ-like example to them in all his instruction and teaching.   \n4. Conclusion. \nWhile acknowledging the sincerity of purpose of the NZ Teachers Council in wanting to produce a code of ethics that is an ‘aspirational and living document’ we have grave concerns and reservations regarding its impact on Christian teachers and our school. The failure to recognize that not all schools have the same moral purpose is a fundamental weakness that undermines any attempt to obtain consensus on a code of ethics.  As Christian teachers the document ‘Towards a Code of Ethics’ lacks credibility because it fails to address the dilemma of diversity. It is offensive to us both philosophically and religiously. The draft code is a concept at war with itself as it seeks to do the impossible – that is to declare a set of ethical principles as a ‘one size fits all.’ Clearly some schools and teachers operate on a philosophical and religious basis that is not supported or expressed in the draft document.   \n5. Recommendation \nThat if the NZ Teachers Council is committed to a Code of Ethics it becomes binding and applicable only to state schools. \nThank you again for the opportunity to respond to this document and to be part of the consultation process. \nYours sincerely    \nShane Kennedy\n18 May 2004  \nPrincipal  \nSt Andrews Christian School \nManurewa \nAuckland \nFootnotes. \nAll footnotes relate to material issued by the NZ Teachers Council entitled ‘Towards a Code of Ethics’ – contents of a workshop kit. \n1.

I guess that's why we slave our arses during the best times of the day only to appreciate life more. But is it too late? I was looking out the window week in and week out counting down the days to my departure. No normal person who was forced to walk out on his job can stay calm and cool plus standing proud to say that this shit feels good. It's bad enough pondering going through a small office where you see that same dumbass perpetrator to your crime. Day one, is good for him and bad for you. Your distraught brings you no good at all.   Finding out that the more you struggle equals sinking faster and deeper. Deeper and deeper into this plight of avarice. A good representation would be of imagining what's it like being in quicksand. When first plunging into the pit, you panic and your brain starts to issue red alert signals throughout your body. Your vision is immediately impaired, and all other senses heighten. You start to confuse the realism in your brain with the surrounding in a nano second. Your body moves in hectic motions trying to grasp anything for a lifeline. Only to be pulled deeper as you fight to separate the reality from the myth - all this while sinking and still sinking.   Finally, the adrenalin expires and your exhaustion creeps in. Your muscles have burnt as much glucose and protein imaginable. You begin to surrender the fight, when you realise that it can't get any deeper, and that the sinking feeling is only as bad as the way you forcefully struggled ( or so you imagined ). Sighing and resigned you bravely reopen your eyes, this time to find that the world is so different from down low. As you feel the remains of what's left of your adrenalin flowing through your veins, you start to feel a natural high. Your senses seem more like normal, you start to enjoy the warmth of the pit, the floating feeling of a buoy and that idiology of being stranded in the middle of nowhere seems so welcoming. A feeling that many pay to feel or enjoy through tobacco addiction or a nudge above - hash. What once was defined and controllable becomes the great unknown. But you like it - the other choices would be to go insane or turn psychotic. For those who have done without, that's divine and I  tabit  (salute) your mettle.  Continuing from the first paragraph, the sooner you recover, the sooner you'll enjoy the view. Your courage and temperament will lift you higher and way above those cowardly perpetrators to your crime. Whichever day you begin to do this, you'll wipe the smiles of their faces and chances are that by now, they are dying in guilt while swallowing all the bullshit that came out through their teeth.   Stress is the key to evolution, understanding it is vital. Some perform miracles when in that state. Others run and cover under the blanket. Experiencing it can be damaging - both mentally and physically. But coming out of it makes you ever stronger. The main ingredient is knowing that stress resides in every humankind, just don't ever let it be your distress. I need not spell out those names of heros turn overnight villains. That's the job of journalists and magazine writers to expose. But I do know corporate arses, and these goons would sell their mother for less than a dime if they could.

        "blog_text": "Today was the last day of learning classes.  Pretty fun.  After school, I went to the library, and Szeman very graciously let me look at her notes.  I don't know how I'm going to do, though.  I misspoke today in history.  We were talking about the Middle East briefly:    Ms. Heidlage : And they have theocracies.  Noah Jampol : What's that?  Me : Rule by the government.   This is an awfully empty-looking post, so I'll put the essay that I wrote yesterday for English about the progression that took place in my writing over the year:   How My Writing Became Sophomoric    Every year, often imperceptibly, the style with which I approach education changes.  It is not my expansion of knowledge that proves to be the most significant growth; it is the small shifts in my behavior toward my schoolwork.  Writing has demonstrated this the most bluntly.  In the beginning of this sophomore year, I had a prosy, self-important air in my essays.  As the year went on, as most students, I grew tired, and began doing each assignment with a set formula.  By the end, I had realized the need to express myself in my writing, and that, along with the flaws I learned to correct, made me respect my work.  Throughout this year, I took great steps in transforming my English ability, helping me to understand how to use my own voice, engagingly and effectively.   When I entered room 348 in September, I thought I had it all figured out.  I had learned “the formula” in middle school, and I used that to churn out virtually every essay I wrote.  All I had to know, I thought, was introduction, body, conclusion, with topic sentences, closing sentences, supporting evidence, and a thesis thrown in there somewhere.  My natural inclination to prevent each paper from being The Most Boring Essay In The World, then, was to use flowery language at critical points.  For example, I used classical allusions and metaphors every so often, as this line from my first essay of the year (the “I am proud of being…, but it’s not without its problems” assignment): “The students and educators of the past two years have argued that to take five honors classes is to steer toward Kharybdis.”  Understandably, above the last word I found the following written on my paper when I got it back: “??!”  This arrogant style made for some decent grades, but some writing of which I am not proud.  Around the middle of the year, I noticed that I had become stuck in a creative rut.  After months of conditioning, I found that all I would do was the formula.  There was no creativity, no personality, no insight, and no fun in my writing.  Papers such as Black Boy responses made this especially evident.  I hate analyzing literature; I always have, I do, and I believe that I always will.  I believe that books and poetry are meant to be read and enjoyed (though I rarely find poetry enjoyable), not dissected.  Bob Dylan is often credited as refusing to “reveal” the meaning of his songs, for he thought that they meant whatever the listener thought they meant.  It’s just music.  It’s just art.  It’s just entertainment.  As a result, I was completely disinterested in the kind of writing done in English class, and I fell back on the kind of formulaic way that I could use while barely thinking about it.  Added to my apathy was the subject matter: racism.  Truthfully, I do not particularly care about racism.  Perhaps it is because it has been hammered into me by English and other politically correct classes for so long.  Perhaps it was the fact that almost every chapter of Black Boy had the same message, and let’s face it, that’s annoying.  Because of these factors, I turned off.  I had no reason to read the comments that were written on my papers, because I had no reason to improve.  I did not write because I wanted to write, as I am doing now.  I wrote because it was assigned, and it had to get done.  About three months ago, I had a revelation that changed my writing forever.  It came in the form of a short story about looking at another’s hands.  I chose my friend’s, because I had some moderately funny things to say at them; at least, they would be funny between us.  For example, I made light of how his hands were anorexic, yellow, and feminine.  I fulfilled the requirements of the assignment, and had fun doing it.  I wrote all of the interesting thoughts I had while I was thinking about his hands, actually made a decent point about society, and infused a lot of my own language, my own voice, into it.  The last few sentences of my paper exemplify these things well:  “Alex,” he questions apathetically, “I forget.  Who was Mustafa Kemal again?” I say to myself, back to the drudgery of school, back to this place that produced the very same cycle in which Loren is trapped and in which I may be doomed to fall. But dammit, who the crap was Mustafa Kemal?  I think that I got a B on that assignment.  I can’t find it.  Even so, I prefer having received a B on a paper I liked and that my peers liked (I put it on my blog) than a technically sound but boring paper. I enjoyed doing that so much that later on, on the plane back from the mock trials national championship in Orlando, I wrote another short story entirely for fun, and posted it on my blog.  Here, I expressed myself even more honestly, and again, my friends liked it.  When I enjoy my work and it is entertaining to others, I feel that I have done my job.  I went through a great number of assignments in English this year before arriving at my grand conclusion about English in the recent past: that being entertaining is nine-tenths of being a good writer.  I moved from formula and pretension to burning out and being left with formula, and finally realizing that I could indeed have fun while doing homework.  I accept that my grades on these papers are not the highest they could be, and that my new style (which in fact transferred almost directly from the style I use on my blog) and its colloquialisms and jokes are sometimes lost on my baby-boomer teachers.  Maybe my writing would not impress Charles Dickens, but frankly, his does not impress me.  When my generation inherits the world, its writers not be composing to entertain nineteenth-century English newspaper fiction writers.  Its writers will be composing to entertain their peers.  After I had posted my “hands” short story on my blog, one of my friends told me that she was laughing the whole time she was reading it.  That is the only grade I need.",

My eyes were hanging with tears by the time I got to the last one, which was taken at where we first met, the beach.  My fingers trailed Edison's face softly. I wanted to feel his face again.. but all I felt was the cold, dry material of the photograph. 'Edison..' I muttered inaudibly.  \nI slipped into my engagement dress and felt the smooth fabric of silk brush past my skin softly. I rushed out of the house and Selina drove me to the ROM. Selina was Edison's sister. And we hit it off right away..  I was extremely nervous. My heart was thumping hard against my chest and my hands were sweating profusely in the white gloves that went with the dress.   \nSelina glanced sideways at me from the driver seat and grinned, 'Nervous?' \n'Yes..' I said, deadpan.   \n'Don't be. It's not even the actual day yet. When I was married to Ahdi, I was really nervous too.. But at that moment when the Priest asked me, 'would you take him as your husband?'.. I said yes.. and I know I made the right choice.' She responded, all the while, her eyes were on the road. \nWhen we finally reached the ROM, Selina turned towards the backseat and reached for the bouquet. She handed it to me and hugged me, 'Good luck, Hebe.' I took the roses and nodded, smiling. I felt better after Selina's assurance. \nWe were 15 minutes early. I straightened my gown nervously and walked up the steps to the ROM unsteadily. Luckily, Selina was there to help me. She was really a good friend. Without her, I would be dead nervous now. \nAhdi, my father and his parents were there already. I could see from the look on my father's face that he was not happy to be here. He wanted me to marry his business partner's son, who was egotistic and thought every woman would fall at his feet. Unfortunately, I didn't. \nDespite my father's objections, I went ahead with the wedding, threatening to break ties with him. I was his only family, so obviously he did not want that. \n'Where is he? He's late!' My father hissed into my ear angrily. He did not like his daughter marrying a pauper. A late pauper, too.   \nI glared at him, 'He's not late! we're early.' \n'If everyone is already here, then, he is late.' He insisted, glaring back at me. \nI ignored him and looked away. The truth is, I was scared. And nervous. But more of scared.. Where is Edison? I wondered. He will be here. I assured myself. It's just the traffic. \nDespite all the self-assurance, I couldn't ignore the unsettling feeling in me heart. We waited for 20 minutes.. Where is Ed? I was really anxious now. \nSelina was calling Edison's mobile phone with hers. 'Voicemail.' She stated simply after hanging up. \nI clasped my hands together tightly, praying that nothing bad happened to Edison. He wouldn't forget today. No, I know that he wouldn't... Just as I was imagining the worst, Edison's best friend, Nicholas Tze, rushed up to us. \nHis expression was anxious and a little sad. I questioned him, 'Do you know where Edison is?' \n'The hospital called. Edison had an accident and was sent to hospital.' He said, finally catching his breath.   \nI stared at him, dropping the bouquet in shock. The unsettling feeling was confirmed. Without speaking, I picked up my gown and ran. My mind was a blank, but my legs carried me to Selina's car.   \nI looked back to see Selina and Ahdi catching up with me. 'Ahdi will fetch us there.' Selina said, she looked really worried for her brother.   \nThe ride to the hospital was silent. No one dared to say anything. Once we reached the hospital, I flung the door open and rushed out, not caring about the glances I earned because I was dressed in a wedding gown. \nIt has been officially one hour since Edison was in the operation room. Edison's parents, Selina, Ahdi, Nicholas and I were seated outside the operation room. My head was rested on my knees. My eyes were closed, but I was wide awake and felt no desire to sleep. I lifted my head and scanned around. \nEdison's mother was resting on her husband's shoulder, sleeping while her husband was dozing off. Selina was leaning on the chair wearily, her fingers interlocked and placed on her lap next to Ahdi's hand. Ahdi had one hand on Selina's lap and one hand around her shoulder. He looked as worried as Selina. Nicholas was sitting beside me, staring blankly at his shoes. \nI let my head drop again. I was praying hard that nothing would happen to Edison. He was my life, my soul, my everything. He can't leave me.   \nFinally, the lights were off and the door opened. Everyone stood up, crowding around the doctor who had just came out of the operation room. \n'We did our best.. I'm sorry. Mr Chen died due to loss of blood.' He said, his eyes filled with sympathy. \nEdison died? I sank to my knees. Edison left me.. You said you would love me forever, Edison.. why didn't you keep your promise?!?! I felt like screaming. The world had just crashed down on me. God, why did you take Edison away from me? My heart was pierced by a thousand knives and it was bleeding fiercely. \nA million words wouldn't bring you back.

Many songs and ovations later, I can look back and say that I have been taught not only about the piano, but taught about life in general, and taught quite well if I do say so.  I started lessons with a neighbor, we didn't have a piano at the time, so I went over there every day to practice.  Finally, I got a [used] piano, the one I still play today, a standing Whitney by Kimball (that needs to be tuned ;)).  I then 'graduated' from my neighbor (I got too good, ok?! :P), and moved on to Susan Holman.  She is an amazing pianist but a fairly craptastic teacher, though I did learn a great deal from her.  She was gracious enough to teach a sixth grader Mozart's Sonata in D Minor.  1+ at contest, standing ovation and even TEARS at my sixth grade talent show (I also gave a DARE graduation speech, but that's another story ;)), and a great story to tell :).  Well, finally my mother had all she could handle of bi-polar Susie, and I moved on to Susan Piffer.  Susan is one of the most genuine people I've ever met.  It's sick XD  She picks your piano form apart, though by the time I came to her I had all of the basics down, so her teaching wasn't very effective for me.  She's very friendly and honest and loving, but... just not my type ;)  I am very honored, though, to go out with her as my teacher.  Seven years of my life.  Once a week.  Going to a stranger's house and playing the piano, then getting picked apart and playing the piano some more.  I'm not going to kid you or make myself out to look like a prodigy.  At one point, I hated the piano.  I despised it.  It was hard and boring, I couldn't figure it out, I was frustrated, and I just hated it.  This is normally where people [like my own sister] give up, pack up, and later regret it.  Not I ;)  Once I learned all the notes, how they sounded with each other, chords, inversions, once I knew about everything there was to know about the sounds, it got so much easier.  I actually enjoyed the piano.  The first song I ever made up was wretched. The second song I made up wasn't much better. Same for the third.  Ah, but then something changed. Suddenly, I realized that I could a) use more than two chords and that b) the chords didn't have to be right next to each other! :O.  I find it quite amusing that I was able to not only find a lyricist, but build a chorus out of the material they graciously gave me during my last week of lessons.  I find it quite sad that the great Ray Charles passed away during my last week of lessons.  I also find now that I am not only capable, but willing to write quality songs, that the guitar is a far more portable instrument than the piano.  Thus.  My next musical adventure.  So if there are any recommendations as to what type of guitar to keep my eyes open for, let them be heard :D  For news, my grandmother was able to come to my recital reception (she got out of the hospital and is doing fairly well), my sister's team won their championship game this afternoon, and I am currently batting .620+ for my own softball endeavours, and George W.

Well, I am single, and I want to do things with you, but I *still* have a life. Just because I don't have to change diapers today doesn't mean there aren't things I need to get done. Don't quiz me on what I am doing if I turn you down. It's nothing personal. I may have planned some alone time. Please keep asking, as I would do the same with you.  3. I have the right to, on the one hand, value my alone time, and on the other hand, still want to seek out someone to share my life with, without being called a hypocrite or judged on it. I can be happy alone, but I might be happier with someone, IF it was the right person. These are not warring impulses. How hard is that to understand?  4. I have the right to expect that you will be looking out for someone for me to date. Yes, I do...Listen up: Are you a true friend? Well, the best way for people to meet is through friends. If you are a true friend, rather than doing #1 and #2 above, you will, upon meeting someone who is single and whom I might like, find out more about them and pass the info to me or see if they might like to meet me. It might be the nicest thing you can do for me.   I am trying to do this on my own as much as I can, but could use extra pairs of eyes. Dating services are awkward. Meeting appropriate people and getting to know them is HARD. Just look at the blogs of my brothers and sisters in arms.   5. I have the right to complain about dating. If you haven't been out there and experienced it in a while, don't criticize me. Instead, re-read #4. And if I find someone, I won't be complaining about dating anymore.",

The denominations I grew up in were splinters of splinter groups -- fundamentalist, dispensational, pietistic, non-glossolial, KJV only, bus-ministry-sunday-morning, AWANA clubs sponsoring, REVEREND [insert the name of the senior minister here on the church sign] churches. These were churches that would 'disfellowship' a 'sister church' because they believed in the mid-tribulational rapture of the church instead of the pre-tribulational rapture of the church. These were churches where missionaries mourned the 'cult-like presence of the charismatics' in the developing world countries they worked.   \nDo I need to clarify that I do not remain in these churches?   \nDid I *hear God* when I was in them? Probably I did, but to me it was always the voice that was speaking over and against the surrounding babble. The voice of God was the marginal, oppositional, secret sub-text, undermining the proto-text.  \nBut since then...!  \nI have tried to be faithful, believing as I still do that God has called me to the divine pursuit, but I have found it very difficult to find a tradition / a community / a place to hear God.   \nLynn and I have heard God in what's felt like waves and then we've wandered in what's felt like silent deserts for eons.  \nThe last three years in Canton has felt, in general, more like a desert. We visited 17 churches, tried to stay in three, had a wonderful homechurch experience that didn't work out.  \nWhen I mentioned to Lynn that people would be standing up in church on Palm Sunday to praise God, I thought I saw her eyes fill with disappointment. I read in her gaze -- what does that have to do with us? God is not talking to us these days. And while I wanted to have a different feeling. Those words reflected my deepest suspicions.  \nBut this past Sunday our church invited the congregation to stand up and talk about God's presence in their lives. Harry (the minister) threatened that if no one stood up, Ebeneezer might just start in (Ebeneezer is a 3'x2' boulder awkwardly placed in the sanctuary alongside the --; a boulder that Harry hauled into the sanctuary ten years ago when he arrived as a marker of where God had brought the church then).  \nPeople stood up and told stories for the next hour and I cried quietly for the whole time.  \nThe stories were about children with precarious physical conditions and horribly specific dietary needs, about losing a baby after two weeks, about losing a seventeen year old sister in the middle of a long unemployment spell, about feeling Grace while marking the fourth year of being widowed. People losing jobs, bumbling through vocations with surprising profit, finding shocking grace in small 'lowly' work, being healed from a fear of marriage.  \nThese people were (I felt astonished) hearing God in their loss, hearing Vocation in the accidents of their work (!), finding truth in the unbearable sacrifices of the quotidian.  \nWhen I first read Sacred Journey, I felt the same quiet tears of relief. That *YES* God could speak to us through the unexpected. Through what was around us. Through our accidents and mistakes.   \nEveryone was calling out Hosannah on Palm Sunday. Jaelyn, my daughter kept using her palm branch to tickle the 23 year old woman in the row before us, who I do not know. The woman was crying, but laughed every time the branch brushed her. Jaelyn's eyes were delighted by everything. When the drums were pounded she raised the branch high and swayed it back and forth. This caused our eleven year old friends David and Michael to laugh.   \nFor the first time in a long time I feel like I am MOVING. That I have a step to make. That my leg is already extended, and I cannot, on any count see where it will land, but I don't care. I want to go. I want to move.",

I was placing the bottle in when I realized I had no room for it.  This is odd because, as anyone who knows me will attest to, I do not eat.

        "blog_text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Uceba Babson used to trudge through flooded plains for more than a mile to reach her one-room schoolhouse, her lunch pail full of syrup-covered biscuits.  That was before buses and roads came to rural Pahokee, and the swampy land made getting to school an adventure. But in 1931, Babson gave up her daily commute through Florida swamps to marry a vegetable farmer.  She now has 81 grandchildren and great-grandchildren to hear her schoolgirl tales, but the end of the story always troubled her. So after outliving three husbands and letting seven decades pass since her last high school class, Babson decided it was time to go back to school.   After two years of hard work — never missing a day of class — she took part in a graduation ceremony Tuesday night, a few months after her 90th birthday. She received a rousing standing ovation, a bouquet of red roses and a congratulatory letter from Gov. Jeb Bush.   Babson — born before World War I broke out, before Charles Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic Ocean, before women won the right to vote — now has new stories of getting to school.   'I studied and studied, and then I learned I actually passed,' Babson said. 'A lot of it was memorizing. You had to remember the rules and at 90, it's hard.'   She tells of days that begin at 4 a.m. with a hot shower and water bottles to get her knees working. She drove herself in a 1997 Mercury on roads that didn't exist in her childhood.   Inspired by a book about a man who was in his 90s when he started high school, Babson dove into her math, English, science and social studies courses.   'I thought, 'If he can do it, there's no reason why I shouldn't,'' Babson said. 'It gave me a purpose and I said, 'If it takes me five years, I'm going to do it.''   She spent many hours a day studying, learning in social studies about the wars that she had lived through and in science about the photosynthesis that helped her family's cornstalks grow.   'I couldn't even pick up a magazine because I felt guilty because I thought I should pick up my books for school,' Babson said.   On her first day at the Adult Education Center, her classroom was nearly unrecognizable from the one-room schoolhouse in Pahokee she had left behind. The desks had computers and the seats were filled with people from Jamaica, Haiti and Latin America.   'We all just blended together. It was wonderful,' Babson said.   The center helps students as young as 16 study for their high school equivalency diploma and helps others take exams and brush up on their English or writing skills.   For Babson, whose quick gait and proud posture make her appear decades younger than she is, putting on her blue cap and gown and picking up her diploma is the culmination of a dream.   'This is something I promised myself a long time ago,' Babson said. 'It's been a challenge, but a wonderful challenge.'",

I understand that none of the main characters are black, but so what? Just because there aren’t any there it doesn’t make the show racist. It actually is more realistic, considering only about 12% of America's population is black, why should there be a black person in every frame or the show. Did Family Matters, the Cosby Show, or any other show about a cast of black people have any white leading roles? No! And you don’t hear any white people bitching about that. Also, every time there is a position of power on this show, have you noticed they almost always tend to be black? Like 2 out of 3 of Chandler's last bosses have all been black. When he goes to an interview, the guy is black, they do this all the time, because they cant introduce a new leading role 9 seasons into the show when they know its going to end a year later. Just a rant. I saw a comment on it in the paper the other day and just seeing what all you guys think…Just for all the angry people whose feelings are hurt about the lack of color on Friends, the producers should extend the show for another 5 years and recast with all black actors and call it 'Black Friends'. But then that wouldn't be good enough either, would it?' I think you would have to be black to understand sounds bad but its true. The phrase 'it's a black thing you wouldn't understand' plays deeply into this situation. I love Friends and I do mean love. I'm parked in front of the TV every Thursday watching, but as a Black person I am the exception not the rule. Most white people love the show because there is a character to identify with. That’s why Blacks have a problem with the lack of color as its being referred to here because where do we get to identify? Overall we shouldn't identify with the color but with the personality and that’s where we are losing out. Yes Blacks have plenty of organizations but if you can not see where those are necessary, your view of this country in a whole is very naive. I love when white people say 'But Black People have BET and UPN' (which is like saying, riding in the back is better than not riding at all right?), yes you could say that but compare that to the other 200 channels that cater to the white demographic and we are still under represented as all minority groups are in this country. Is it right for ‘The Black’ shows to be just as narrow-minded? No, it’s not. My personal opinion is that its television and nothing on TV should be taken this serious. But Art imitates life (yea I said it) and thus what does it say when one of the highest rated shows which has been on the air for 9 years and has only had 2 Blacks in main guest appearance roles (and those have been in the last two years)?",

        "blog_text": "So within the last couple of weeks, most all of the school districts in the Monroe County area of Upstate NY passed their school budgets, allowing school districts to move forward in the hiring process.  This past week, I've heard rumblings from several different schools expressing interest in me that I'm in the hunt for several positions.  Now before people start asking me to check my ego at the door, I'll stop you right there because I already have.  In my frame of mind, I try to follow the Buddhist belief of remaining in the present moment, and having expectations of the future would come at the expense of this moment (I'll save that explanation for a future post).  In short, I'm more interested in enjoying the substitute opportunities that I have for the rest of the school year.  When the Fall comes, there is nothing I can do to stop it.  Whether or not I have a job is the least of my concern.    Since the end of the school year is approaching, it's important to know that sick time for teachers does NOT roll over and accumulate from year to year.  You have something like 10 sick days and 5 personal days to use each year, period.  If you have perfect attendance for 10 years and you run into some emergency that requires a year off, you don't get to use sick days (rather, you get to benefit from tenure :) ).  So towards the end of the school year (like right around now) - teachers are taking days off left and right.    Anyways, as I am enjoying these last few weeks of school, I am encountering more and more substitute teachers.  Every time I meet one, I feel like it's easier for me to relate to them because I am also looking for a permanent job in a school.  Subbing is fun, but it sucks at the same time.  We share war stories about classes to avoid, how our job hunts are going, and things like that.  These are people that I meet maybe once or twice in my life, but we already know each other in way.  That's the nice side of me when I meet other subs.  The mean side of me wants to paint their faces with animal blood and then dunk their heads in a shark tank.  Any time I meet or even look at another sub, I feel like I'm the wife who's been cheated on by her husband and I'm sizing up the piece of trash my husband left me for.  I can honestly feel myself giving these subs the once over and passing final judgement on them within seconds.  I've judged other subs by what they wear  ('JUST A BUTTON DOWN SHIRT AND KHAKIS? WHERE IS YOUR TIE?!?!') , and I've judged by seeing them teach (don't even get me started on some of these people).  The way that I look at it, every sub that I see is both a friend and an enemy.  I want you to complain to me about your class, or about the places you've worked so that I may offer you comfort and support.  But I also want to hear about these things so that I can get a leg up on you in our 'competition', which is why you will never hear a negative peep out of me when it comes to anything related to a school district.  Oh I do complain sometimes, like when I blog or when I vent to my fiance, but it never goes further than that.    So essentially, one of the biggest fundamentals of job hunting is to find out as much information from your competition as you can so that you may be able to get a leg up on them when it comes to interviewing for potential positions.  I guess the saying that you should keep your friends close and your enemies closer is more true that I thought it was.",

Well i think i should start off by putting down what im hopeing to achieve here , why im keeping this blogg. whats it all about etc......  Well I have been fortunate enought ot recently find something that has been missing in my life for a very very long time, and something that is not at first easy to explaine. Im not like the majority of people out there and for a long period in my life ive known i dont fit in . normal life just dosent feel right for me i have a much deeper and more primal side that for far to long i needed to both become aware of and start to satisfy. so what am i yammering on about ??  well im a slave , a daddys boy and thats somethign which isnt at first easy to explain but is a huge part of who I am. I dont feel complete or a whole person without haveing something vitally important to my state of beeing ( God this is getting heaavy alreddy) I need to be owned controled and taken over completly by another man, and for those of you reading this who arnt in the bdsm comunity i no that this is goign to be a concept thats totally alien for you , and for that im very sorry. i hope youll bear with me as i fumble my way through trying to clarify all this .  There was until very recently a huge gaping hole inside me a need for something that for many years i didnt understand, im fortunate enough now to have become aware and come out to myself, which is wounderfull its given me a chance to be the person i need to be. Ive been fortunate enough to meet an incredable man, my Dad and Master, Bearfoot. Ive submited fully to his authority and am owned out right by him. what does that meen well basically I am his boy and slave, im here to satisfy his needs in every way and i couldent be more happy about it . for the first time in my life i feel totally complete and at peace. I have a long and very hard journey in front of me , im going to stumble a lot, I have alreddy and i no i will contimnue to do so. but im on a wounderfull journmey guided by my Dad and Master.   It involves giving over full controll of my life to him, all deescisions, financial controll, how i dress look act my day to day duties and responsabilitys, everything. And being owned totally. it involves Satisfying my Dads every need , be that a sexual, sadistic, or mundane house hold request . i Do it with out question or thought . total obedience. I no by now a lot of you will be eather horified or wont be able to get your heads round this, but belive me its a wounderfull and beutifull thing to give yourself totaly and completly to another man. to pass on all controll. to me it has been a case of giving up so litttle and gaining so much in return.  on wedensday 8th My Dad snaped his collour round my neck and i was finally and totally owned. and i cant tell you how proud I feel to ware this collor. well im begining to waffle here i have so much more to say but i think i need to calm my head a little before posting so illleave you with this . Im totaly new to this world but feel totally at peace and comfortable in it. I find it over whelming emotional scarey and for the first time in my life i no im exactly where i need to be. its going to be hard, its going to be very dificulyt at times its going to scare the hell out of me and im going to be pushed to places i never thought i could go , but its also going to be wounderfull and i cant wait . so keep poping in and ill keep you updated with all my hopes fears concerns happy and sad moments the mistakes i make, and the hurdles i climb for my Dad. im at the start of a wounderfull road here and i hope youll come along with me",

Surrounded by skin but there's not anything inside, feels like my mind has retreated to the back of my head and is watching with somewhat glazed eyes what is happening with the rest of the world. There's some stuff I wanted to say because I miss you. You said that you think I'm going to leave you, I suppose that means you think I'm ignoring you or not paying you any attention. Look at this from my perspective. When do I leave you? I leave you when you are completely ignoring me. You no longer seem to distinct between me being there and me not being there, except that if I'm not there then obviously you feel compelled to find me. I've been trying especially hard since the monday before last to pay as much attention as I physically can to you to see if you would do the same back. The amount of attention you paid me on my birthday was huge and you made it my best birthday ever, admittedly when I'm comparative to all my other birthdays that's not saying much but you made me enjoy my birthday which is something which I haven't done for a very long time. Now that my birthday has come and gone it's receding back into a lull. I pull you over to me when we're sitting down and you resist, your happier with me not touching you, in an attempt to get over this I know try as hard as I can to sit beside you so that I can hold you. But half the time I'm holding you it feels as though I'm some superfluous limpet and you don't even notice I'm there. I know you're insecure but I don't understand why are you so insecure. I've bee here for the past 6 months and I've not gone, I've never cheated on you and the truth is that I've never wanted to, that of course sounds like bullshit, but it's the truth and yes well raar. What I'm saying is how can I make you secure? I want you to sometimes come to me and hug me, take my hand, kiss me, maybe make the odd decision once in a while, this is not having a go and that is something you must recognise. I'm going to keep trying but it'll leave me feeling hollow and fake. This isn't related to the phone call we just had, this isn't something that's making me sad because it's the way you are and I may have to live with it but I just wanted to make you aware of things in response to your blog from my perspective.

Whoever created existence had a sense of humour, and if it was some God figure then he was a masochist for creating us, if we were intended to worship him then he's pretty arrogant. Worship has nothing to do with good, evil, right or wrong, it's to do with power. If there was a God and he was good then he would have created equals because respect can be earned among equals, from superiors it is only demanded.  I love you with all my little heart, it's all the love I can give you and if it's not enough then forgive me, for I have nothing else to give. However... I do love you.  This was all written post-phonecall so don't tell me I was lieing that there was nothing useful on my blog.  Smile, I love you.

        "blog_text": "Wednesday, January 21, 2004.  Thorn in my side: My family.    Welcome to my blog, my pyschopathic sister tried to kill herself a week ago tonight, I saved her life and today I am the family's pariah.  Still with me?  All right, if you can take that, you can take anything else I might write.    Somehow I felt I ought to be sharing all this, and what is going on. Maybe it's a cautionary tale, maybe it's interesting, maybe its a comment on what society has become, maybe I'm just whining.  At any rate, welcome to Rosenthorns.  So, let's get back to this sister's attempted suicide thing.  My sister is a psychopath. And I don't mean that in the colloquial sense, the way we used to use the word 'terrorist' to describe an energetic two-year-old, but don't anymore.  I mean, she is a severely ill psychopathic woman.  She has caused my entire family nothing but pain for all of her adult life.  She stole from my parents, lied to everyone she ever knew, cost me every old friend I ever had with whom she came into contact, stole my SSN and took my name, ruined my credit, cost me at least two major corporate jobs when I failed the background check, and cost me thousands of dollars in additional fees when I tried to buy a house. She poisoned my dogs.  She has never had a long term relationship with another living soul, but has created some very imaginative boyfriends. Real boyfriends can be identified by their restraining orders against her. This is not a colloquial psychopath, this is a clinical psychopath.  Last Wednesday night, I got a call from someone I never heard of. 'Regarding your sister,' was all the message said. I almost didn't call. 'God,' I thought. 'she ripped someone else off and is now coming after her family for the money.'  But I did call. It was the Right Thing to Do. And Pam always does the Right Thing.  The voice on the other end of the phone told me that my sister has been threatening suicide, and earmarked the next day as the day she would do it.  My other sister had told this person that our sister is a pathological liar and that she should ignore the messages. However, if she felt that she needed to, she should call up our sister Pam, because Pam always Does the Right Thing.  I told this person that there was at least a 60% chance that my sister was lying, but because the next day was our parents' anniversary, I thought it would be best to at least attempt follow through. After two harrowing hours on the phone with a completely inept San Francisco Police Department, they broke into her house and found her chock full of Valium with a plastic bag over her head and two suicide notes.  Apparently nobody in our family can say anything in less than two pages.  She was 'detained' and then promptly lost by the SFPD for another two hours, while I tried to track her. The ineptiude of SFPD is epic, but that's another Thorn in My Side.  Anyway, now it's a week later. My parents, who never were particularly good decision makers, have come rushing to her aid with open arms and checkbook. They mortgaged their home and are paying her way through everything while my sister continues to lie to them.  They are supporting her rather extravagant lifestyle while she gets 'help,' though most psychiatrists agree that psychopaths are beyond the help of their profession.  They have practically canonized her, constantly speaking in glowing terms about how she is going to get job training, how she is going to make good on all her debts, how she is going to get better and has such a bright future.  I raised a point. 'Um,' I said, 'Can you afford to be supporting her to the tune of $2000 a month?  Is there a reason she has to stay alone in her three-bedroom apartment in North Beach with a view of the bay that costs more than my home mortgage?  Do you have any time limit for this open-checkbook policy? Do you have any expectations of her?'  I explained to them there was a difference between helping and enabling, and that they were not doing anybody any good by supporting her lifestyle so that she can go out and lie, cheat and steal some more with no end in sight. I explained that help would entail a plan, with an end-date, a budget based on what they could afford, and a list of expectations.  My parents angrily told me that they would pay for 'as long as it takes,' informed me that I have no compassion, and told my sister that she should not talk to me because I am 'hysterical.'  There's another aspect to this little tale.  I have a five year old son.  My husband and I really feel that a five year old really shouldn't be subjected to a psychopath who has already shown she is dangerous to herself and to others, and let's not forget that she poisoned our dogs, not once but twice, with what two sets of vets think was some kind of detergent. My parents insist my sister is of no danger, and that I am being horrible. The words 'Child Endangerment' seem to mean nothing to them.  Meanwhile, some of my other friends have been very critical of my actions in preventing her suicide. Here in San Francisco, we are very politically correct, you see, and we are allowed to do with our bodies what we please. I am apparently a fascist because I prevented my sister from doing what she pleased with her body.  Still others have criticized me for saving her because she is so useless, she's caused nothing but pain, she wasn't worth saving, and now I've caused my family more because I had to be a hero.  I am not a hero. I did not save my sister for her sake. I saved my sister so it wouldn't hurt my parents. There's an irony, huh? I am not a willing victim, as someone suggested. I did the Right Thing. I know I did.  But damn it all, it is awfully lonely.",

On another occasion I noticed that he was outside playing in the snow with my siblings and I rushed to get my stuff on, but by the time I made it outside I caught only the tail end. Then he got up and went in. I also don't remember my dad putting me to bed or talking to me. I was mostly scared of him. I say this not as a critisism - now that I am older I understand the reason why he was the way he was - but I feel like I do not know what my kids are experiencing because, even though they tease me about being boring, I do play with them and keep the lines of communication very open. I only scare them once in a while for kicks. It is a strange thing to raise your kids is such a different way than you were raised that you cannot even relate to what they are experiencing. BUT I know it is good, so if there are any dads or would-be dads out there reading this - spend lots of time with your kids. It's worth the exhaustion!!  The other thing it made me think of was the time Marsha and I and the kids were all invited to an Island on Cape-Breton Island by some friends of ours here in Halifax. Our homeschooling at the time revolved largely around Pirates. So Marsha and I packed some candy treasure in our bags without the kids knowing. When we arrived on the Island we tossed a flag with the jolly roger into some prominent bushed by the water where the kids were sure to find it. Sure enough they found it and knew immediately what it meant. There were pirates in them waters!! We hoisted the flag and spent the rest of they day talking about the danger we might be in. The next day we planted a bottle with a treasure map on the beach which the kids also found. The map led to three smaller maps that needed to be combined in order to find the buried treasure. It took the whole day for them to find the X. The treasure chest was full of gold-coin chocolates and other treats which they devoured EVEN THOUGH they knew for certain the pirates would be coming after them. They so fell for this that it was the topic of many conversations for years afterwards. I would come home from work and casually drop something like, 'I saw some men down by the waterfront who I am sure were pirates.' This would create a level of unease and talk about how to protect yourself if the pirates found out it was us who stole their treasure. Traps were laid about the house just in case.

        "blog_text": "Well, it's been some time since I last posted. But then again, so much has happened within this time, I have had many lows (with few highs) to give me an incentive to write. My divorce became final on March 24, 2004. A day I will never forget. It's the day I became myself once more. I reclaimed my birthright..... my surname of Reagan. Now I hear some of you saying, So what?! Well, I was adopted at the tender age of 5, and my birth name became a thing that never existed, according to US law and the State of New Hampshire. I had to go to court to get my records unsealed. At the age of 45!! And then, some numb person had decided to take my ACTUAL ORIGINAL birth certificate and either lost it, or destroyed it! (I wasn't impressed, and neither was the judge!) So, he went and did something never done before.... he AMENDED my original (because now my adopted birth certificate is considered my original!) birth certificate to say at the top.... Adopted.... Was formerly Debra J. Reagan. WOW!!! As most of you know, no one can fool around with an original LEGAL US government document in any way. But, this was a first.... and the judge was so upset at the mishandling of my documents, that he decided, even though an adoption birth certificate is considered to take place of the original one, the original one is still the original one. And since my was gone, he had the right to amend the adoption one. As the saying goes, there's always a first time for everything! Now, I tell you all this because it's important for you to understand my state of mind here. And the fact that my Daddy, whom I love so dearly (even today) died in 1984. The day after his funeral, his wife and biological son, disowned me. (Not a surprise because she hated and abused me through out my life) Now, I'm alone in this world.... no family that is emotionally mine and no name that is truly mine. So, here comes my divorce, yet another failure in my life, and I decided to take control of my own ship, finally... at the age of 47! I told the judge that I wanted my birth right back, and got it! Now, I'm on a journey... to find ME!!! The me before my first set of parents abandoned me, before the State took me and changed my life forever, before my name changed and forever wiped away my ancestral lineage and family roots. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE my Daddy, and am so very happy that I grew up with such a fine, loving man as he was, and still is in my heart. But I also know, that there is something in the saying.... blood is thicker than water. And I believe that one's soul is intimately connected to it. Because my soul is singing quite loudly at my finding out who I am, where I came from, and is so greatly affecting the person I am becoming to be. My Irish roots are strong, as well as my Black Indian roots. The search is very exciting and interesting and I'm loving each minute of it. This OLD caterpillar is now exiting her cocoon and the butterfly whom is emerging, is quite beautiful indeed! My blood pulses with the celtic music of Ireland, and American Indian and African drums..... my ancestors are looking down upon me, smiling and proud that I am finding who I actually am.... and they sing through my soul.... welcoming me home.  I'll write more soon. \nIf all else fails, I will retreat up the valley of Virginia, plant my flag on the Blue Ridge, rally around the Scotch-Irish of that region, and make my last stand for liberty amongst a people who will never submit to British tyranny whilst there is a man left to draw a trigger. -- George Washington, at Valley Forge.

We had 'fought' our way to yet another consecutive LitSoc win. The next litsec would say in his inaugural speech, '... We have been winning Litsoc for n+1 years ! We've gotta win it for the (n+2)th time!... blah blah' . Oh Boy ! What a blast !  [All this is not to say mine was the only hostel that did shit. I'm sure every hostel did, does and will continue to do truckloads of shit every lit-year. The whole system is flawed. Scrap the  damned litsoc I say. Yeah ! Let people participate for personally glory. Not for the glory of their hostel. 'Aint no such thing as hostel spirit. That's what I say!]  In the middle of all this fighting, we had lost the bigger picture. We didn't know why we were devoting so much time and effort into winning. Perhaps some of my friends realized it earlier than I did (You know who you are. Good for you !) and some never really realized it. It was like waking up from Neo's dream. When I did wake up, it wasn't an abrupt dawning of facts. It was slow and painful. A large fraction of people in my hostel don't even know what litsoc means, leave alone having enthu to participate in it. Oh heck ! What the hell !  In my third year I learnt a great deal about the internal working of Litsoc. Deeper and deeper I went and it consumed me. I've never admitted it to myself but now I think this whole litsoc thing had a huge influence on my academic output. (Heheh.. Who cares ?) During this year I handled major hostel decisions in the lit-scene and also attended some litsec meetings... thanks to my good friend...oops COLLEAGUE, Mr. Bose. Yeah, he was the litsec then and he made i moved my ass a good deal so we could push our hostel to yet another victory. After all, who'd like to loose a Litsoc under his litsec-ship, especially a litsec-ship won through great pains after a four way election  ? hahahah. (I love the colleague thing btw!).  So in April 2003, we did another Mandak Litsoc win. After a huge amount of haggling, flinging of accusations, the details of which i will pass, and court-of-law-style quarreling with rival hostels and the culsecs, all of which hated us by now, we 'engineered' another glorious win, this time beating rivals Jam by 2.5 points. I was to be the next litsec of Mandak. Man, it felt good. Oooohhhh yes it did.   I learnt a great many things in the following year. My finally year at IIT and at Mandak. The most important of these was the realization that everybody in Mandak wanted to win the Litsoc (even though some of these people didn't know what LitSoc really was) but very few people wanted to do anything to contribute towards that desire. I inwardly felt we didn't really deserve to  win if we didn't have the will to. Ten or twelve people in a hostel of 250 just wasn't good enough. And so in April 2004, we broke the chain ! We lost Litsoc to a very deserving Alak. I wonder now if the loss meant anything at all to the bulk of people who live in Mandak. Hmmm.   When I look back now, i see the mistakes we made, the mistakes i made. We were blinded, i was blinded. Litsoc really isn't about winning - and I don't say this because we lost under my litsecship (but then again I wouldn't have had the chance to reflect had we won again) - its about participating and having fun ;)   (Ye hear that gape ? Its about having fun! 'course you don't understand a word of that , do you ?  Heheheh... )    Above left: Gapa. Our new litsec (enjoying a lighter moment) All the best to you baby!

'I feel'.  'I don't feel like it'... stands as a logically acceptable and highly understandable reason to not do something in my world. I find myself very confused when the world accuses me of being lazy.... I am not lazy, I just don't feel like doing somethings... thats all!! Why cant the world composed of mysterious beings born under even more mysterious sun signs understand this simple fact? I don't know if its true about most people ... I seem to feel more than I think and what is worse at times I cannot distinguish between the two. I know I am thinking in a negative way when I keep coming up with negative ideas and arguments about a situation in my head... but when I have a bad feeling... its just a feeling and isn't necessarily accompanied by thoughts. At times it becomes difficult to draw the line ... and it is at those times that I find myself devoid of any direction whatsoever. I have strong reasons also to believe that more than any form of education or professional experience.. I have learned and grown most because of what I feel. It might sound like a stupid example... the first time I burnt my hand as a kid .. I cried... but eventually I matured and can confidently work my way with things involving fire without the fear of getting burnt simply because I have lived the feeling of getting burnt... I have been there .. cried .. healed and forgotten it. Its this 'Been there ... felt that' feeling that comprises the maturity with which I do things. I have learnt that whenever I have rejected my own feelings I have lost. Yes.... making a fool of myself in front of the whole school forgetting my speech midway.. did feel very bad. I couldn't gather the courage to go up on stage till the time I kept on rejecting the feeling of being insulted. It took me time to learn to live that feeling. Once I could live it... I no longer feared it.. I could go up on stage and say my speech.. perfectly knowing that if I goof up big time again.. I will feel terribly insulted... but well I now know how to live through that feeling. The important thing is to not brand a feeling as unwanted... you have to explore what it has to offer... believe me.. pain, disappointment and heartbreaks have as much to offer to the soul as the elations and joys. Emotions and feelings aren't hurdles (like most proponents of objectivity might claim)... I think one needs to flow with them and grow with the experience. I can put full faith in providence and people because I have learned to live the feeling when your faith is shattered, I am no more scared of being betrayed by anyone...cause if somebody does.. I know how to deal with it!! I can give and receive love easily cause I know how to actively deal with heartbreaks.

        "blog_text": "Time for another short trip down memory lane...  It comes as a bit of a surprise to me that some people are intimidated by me, or rather, by certain things about me. I feel strongly that the cause of the intimidation is my vocabulary. I find this to be almost laughable, because I do not consider either my vocabulary or my treatment of the English language to be anything over which to be troubled. This is where I take a moment to attempt to explain why I have such an affinity for the language. It boils down to a simple thing: spite. Perhaps 'spite' is too strong a word, but I am at a loss for a better definition (see?). When my parents were children, they were the subject of racial discrimination. Technically, it should probably be called 'ethnic' discrimination, but most people call it racial and would be confused to hear it called what it might really be. My parents were Spanish-speaking U.S. citizens, living in central Texas. When they went to school and were caught speaking Spanish, they were punished, or at least reprimanded by the school teachers. As if that were not enough, when they were a little older and began to ride on public transit, they were ushered to the back of the bus, along with the African Americans, who were also being robbed of their civil rights. I cant say exactly when it happened, but at some point during the course of events that served to bruise the pride of a particularly proud young Hispanic man, he decided that, when he had children that they would learn to speak the language of the people who had berated him and his wife. And so, when I was able to speak and read, it was English that I consumed, and I grew to a degree of mastery of such that it was not long before I was helping those for whom English was the language of their family to better use it. I speak English very well, I must concede, but at the cost of losing touch with the language of my parents. When I hear people speaking Spanish now, I feel as if I am hearing distant echoes of my parents' voices, and those of their parents -- only I cannot make out the meanings of their words to save my life.",

        "blog_text": "Writing in this journal has been therapeutic for me.  It has allowed me to open up, to be able to talk more about myself more than I have before.  I dont know if many people realized this but I dont talk about myself much or open up as freely as most people do.  I hold back a lot of thoughts and emotions that I have towards others and myself around me.  I wish that people could know me more than they do.  My only reasoning for not opening up is that I was sheltered growing up and didnt live as much as most do.  I was inward with my emotions and there were very few people that I felt I could talk to about them.  The subject of this entry is about me opening up and this is what I want to do.  I want to get something off my chest and this is the only way I could do it.  This month is the fourth anniversary of the suicide of my friend, Priscilla Sulieman.    What you have to realize about me is that I never really had anybody close to me die.  The closest thing was my grandfather when I was 7, but I was never close to him.  Up through high school, I was so sheltered and unaware of the world that I did not understand death of anybody close.  I meet Priscilla in my freshman year of college, in 1996.  She was only 16, being very intelligent rising past some grades in High School.  She was also very beautiful, being Middle Eastern and Caucasian blood, with long thick brown hair, olive skin, and big brown eyes.  I was thinking of asking her out but she was too young!  For the next two school years, I had a few classes and labs with her.  She always gave me a smile when I said hello.  I knew she would go far. But I never really hung out with her outside of class as much as in class.which I regretted.   It was in August of 1998 that I heard the news that changed my life.  Most of the people I knew from college, including Priscilla, lived in Northern Virginia, while I was here in Charlottesville for summer vacation.  I kept in contact with my friend Andy by email, who also knew Priscilla.  It was one day that I received news from Andy that Priscilla had committed suicide.  No one knew why she did it, and I never found out how she did it.  During this time, I was home alone while my parents were away on vacation.  I was so numb from the news and did not have anybody to turn to.  I was depressed all that week that I was alone.I did not know what to say or think.  This was the first person that I knew that had committed suicide.  When I came back to school a few weeks later, I asked around with the others on what happened.  No one knew why she did it and how she did it.  The school had a memorial service for her at a local church.  It was packed when I got there so I had to stand at the entrance.  They had people who knew her best talk about her and prayers.  However, I never found out why she did it.  Since then, I wonder if I could have done something to change things.  I know it is nave of me to think I could have changed things.  But I wonder if I was some how closer to her, could I have been enough of a friend to help her out.  This thought has plagued me since then.  I lie away at night, trying not to forget her what she looked like, her smile, her laugh.  But then a morbid thought turns to what happened the day she killed herself.  I see her in her bathroom, looking at herself in the mirror, crying her eyes out, and then deciding to end it there.  I dont know how she did it so I keep thinking of the many ways that you can kill yourself.  It haunts me at night when I try to sleep.  So much that I cant help but weep sometimes that it puts me to sleep.  But I dont want to forget her.  Since that time, I tried to make the effort to be involved with friends lives.  I want to be there for anyone who needs help.  However, I am conscience of a dilemma that I have made for myself that is thinking of how much involved in my friends lives.  I dont want to push myself into someones life because I feel that I would turn him or her off from being a friend.  On the only hand, I dont want to just disappear from the scene and wait for someone to come to me.  I worry about being forgotten and then I would lose that friendship.  So it has been my solution to barely be visible to those that I have called friends, trying to not do so much or so little with them, by just sending the occasional email or joke to them, saying that Im still here.  So here is my therapeutic remedy.  I do feel better opening up on this.  It has been weighing on my chest for the past few years.  For those that are reading this, I hope you understand the weight of my story and understand me more.  I know some of you have been in this same situation.  My advice is never forgetting those close to you.  Be there for them, for you never know when it will be the last time you see them.",

I am a 25  year old girl from Maryland orginally, but bounces between 2 states now. It's been a hard year for me, my mom was killed instantly on December 11th of last year, when the car I was driving got struck head on. I had a broken arm in two places but I am still here, lonely without her. I have to say I struggle between depression and lonely a lot. Sometimes even guilt, I struggle  with the fact that she's gone and I am here alive confused on what my next move should be. I feel like God has left with with this huge burden, and I have no clue what to do with it. The feelings of guilt are the hardest for me, I have two younger sisters, one of which doesn't like me at all I think that maybe they wish I were dead instead of my mom. There are days where I get angry, mothers day and easter have been the hardest for me, Christmas I feel like I was still in shock. Maybe I am still in shock, there's this over whemling need to do something, yet I feel paralized dead and cold. I am lonely all of the time, and I feel myself shying away from old friends, my old life is just a distant thought. It's so cliche' to say I didn't know what I had, but I did, my mom  was my best friend, my world. Now that there's no one to share it with... how do I go on? It seems like death may give me comfort although I am not suicidal, there are days where I hope I don't want to wake up. My heart ache's and the day of the accident flashes through my head as though I was doomed to live with it  the truck heading into my lane, my screams filling the air when my unconcious mom was lying on the seat next to me, I often ask myself why did I have to see that, why did I have to watch her die.  There's a lump in my throat now, and tears are welling up in me... I don't want to be this person I don't want pitty, I just want my life back. Nothing will ever be the same. She'll never see me married she'll never see her grandchildren, she'll never see me be anything more than the loser I was before she died.

Or I lie there, unable to sleep anymore, but still, I'm to exhausted to move.  Of course I can't just lie in bed all day.

And there were actually two days this week, Tuesday and Wednesday, when I felt about 80% healthy most of the day.  We'll forget about the part where I fell asleep for 3 hours on Wednesday afternoon.  But those were two days out of the last three months.  And there were probably less than a dozen of those out of the last six months.    I trivialized it for a long time.  I denied it for a long time.  Then I thought I came to terms with it.  I was proud of myself for dealing so well.  I thought it was a waste of time thinking about how I felt.  But then I did start thinking about it.  It's subtle, but it's there.  I lose concentration on anything after a couple of hours.  I read at the rate of about a page every five minutes.  I lean on the side of the elevator to support myself.  It doesn't even occur to me to go to bed unless it's bedtime, no matter how I feel.    I didn't care before.  My rationale is that we all have our shit to deal with.  We have family issues and insecurity issues and financial issues and relationship issues.  I've been blessed to not have dealt with any of those problems, so I have this instead.  And there are so many others out there who have it so much worse than I do. So what if I can't go snowboarding this year.  So what if I can't dance all night at a club.  So what if I can't carry in a bottle of laundry detergent from the car. So what if I can't take the stairs up to the third floor without worrying about not being able to get out of bed the next morning.  I'll deal.  If only it weren't so fucking annoying.",

        "blog_text": "RIP Connie Wei-Luen Kao 09.05.1989 - 04.08.2002  Two whole years...how fast it's been.  Seems like only yesterday we were playing around, competing against each other, and making complete fools of ourselves.  Not a day goes by in which I don't think about how life would be different with you here, to help and to guide me, as you had done for 10 years.  We truly brought out the meaning of 'best friends forever'....and it was great.  Meeting you the second day of preschool with Anna, running around the playground and screaming and laughing, has changed my life in a way nothing else ever could.  We were the teachers' pets all the way through preschool, and we entered kindergarten together at Mesa.  I can still remember those sessions where Mattson let us do first grade work, and the worksheet about Donald Duck rowing the boat cracked us up for some silly reason.  Everyday we would mess around and have fun and grow closer and closer.  Second grade year, Wesley came, and the three of us grew even more inseparable.  The fight between you and Wesley had me running around between the both of you....and yet, at the end of the year, we all emerged as one.  We swore to be best friends forever, and only through the later years has that proven itself true.  Your smile and personality eventually led you to become friends with everyone, and though we didn't 'hang out' as often, our bond was never broken.  Our daily competitions for the better grade continued, and I remember the GATE test being pretty significant.....  Everything was going great; we both excelled in every aspect and tossed challenges back and forth, and I can truly say those challenges that you put me up against shaped my life, and I hope mine did the same for you.  Then came seventh grade year.  I had been a constant show-up at all your birthday parties, always held the weekend before the beginning of the school year.  This was the one time I turned you down to go with my family on vacation, and I regret that beyond all.  I still remember the first day of school when we settled in Mekenian's seventh grade GATE class....you leaned over to me and said, 'These are all smart people...I'm not going to be top of the class.'  Even then you showed your impossibly accurate interpretation of the people around you.  The Friday before Spring Break was a happy one; after school, we met at the lockers and said our good-byes.  How I regret not making more of our time together that day.  The Monday back from Spring Break was the polar opposite.  At first, I heard only snatches of conversation about what had happened over the weekend.  Then I heard your name.  Disbelief flooded inside me, denial took over.  Noranbrock broke the news to the class, and there was a stunned silence in the room.  I couldn't believe it.  I refused to believe.  Second period, still in denial, I was addressed by Mr. Lee again about what had happened. The seriousness of the situation bit at me....I was still refusing to believe.  Passing period, from second to third, hit me hard.  I passed by Wesley, and I saw her eyes.  At once, my fears were confirmed.  She had been undoubtedly crying, and I knew there was no way out.  We hugged but said nothing.  The bell rang.  Into third period.  The counselors were there; they came to all your classes.  It was then that I understood -- you were gone.  The truth hit me harder than anything ever had; I broke down.  Nor was I the only one to do so, more than half the class was.  I remember the questions meant to help us.  They did not console me; in fact, they hurt me further.  I realized and began to think back to all those times I could have talked with you just a bit longer, listened just a bit better, as you had always done for me.  Mekenian came over after the counseling, and she comforted me.  Nothing ran through my mind but the last image I had of you; the last glimpse of you I had....running out of the locker section towards Spring Break.  The rest of the day was pandemonium.  Chinese School, which had been your second home, and mine as well, grieved as a whole.  No one said much, but the feelings were unmistakable.  The funeral was held a week later, and attended by more than 800, all of whom had been touched by you, Connie, you, a 12-year-old girl who knew and accepted nothing but happiness and victory.  I stood on the second floor, the balcony, of SkyRose Chapel and listened to the various eulogies given by the guests, and it shocked me, though it shouldn't have, the number of people you touched within 12 years.  I had been one of the luckiest, to have known you for so long and been able to talk to you whenever I needed to.  As I approached the casket, I was numb with grief and shock, for I was not yet ready to accept.  I said my final good bye to you.  Last year, this very day, was hard on everyone.  Your garden had been dedicated on the 5th of September, 2003.  The various messages written on the table Calton had brought out brought me into remorse once again, knowing you had done so much for me, yet I did not come close to returning the favor.  Graduation came, and the entire class thought about you as your presence was felt as the names were read off.  You were honored.  We were silent.  And now, you have led me into a new direction once again; this is the most personal thing I have written in quite a while.  You were always there for me whenever I needed it, and, make no mistake, you still are.   Ten Years Just Weren't Enough 'Twas the day back to school  After the week of spring break.  Little did I know I would soon learn something  That would cause mine, and many more, hearts to ache.   The students were socializing,  Catching up on a week's worth of separation.  And then I heard the terrible news  And thought it a figment of imagination.   Came the words of my first period teacher,  'There's been a loss to the Mesa Robles family,'  'Our friend and fellow student Connie Kao has passed,'  And it was then I knew it true, and tears came readily.   Of course it was hard on everyone  Who knew of the terrible news,  But it depressed me greatly;  I had known you since the age of two.   I really couldn't see or realize what happened that day,  Teachers and friends knew the bond between you and I,  And they tried to console me,  Each patting me on the back quite fondly.   I tried to listen to my friends,  Sure their intentions were true;  Yet how to replace a best friend  I'd known since the age of two?   That day will stay forever in my mind: April 8, 2002;  And now it's been a little over a year and a half.  There is still nothing on Earth  I would not give just to have you back.  In Loving Memory Connie Wei-Luen Kao I miss you.....",

        "blog_text": "For the last couple of days I feel like I've been in trading spaces, Monday afternoon my roommate calls me at work and tells me we're going furniture shopping when I get off. We spent 2 hours picking a sofa/loveseat/end table set, I gotta say that the piece im more excited about is the Chaise Lounge Chair; its so pretty. After that Kenn dragged us to Woodys because he wanted to do scaryokee, that evening turned out to be kinda interesting. I ran into an old friend who I hadn't seen in a long while and then I kicked ass on the trivia network thinggy they have at the bar.  Then Tuesday morning, my roommate wakes me up at freaking 8 in the morning to go pick up a u-haul to go get the furniture because they wouldn't be able to deliver it until Saturday and neither of us had time to receive the furniture and assemble whatever it had to be assembled that day so off we went to pick up the furniture, my friend Mike helped us. I gotta say the room looks a lot better (see Pic)   the freaking entertainment center was a pain in the ass to put together and heavy as a MoFO! We still need to make some arrangements and buy a few things to make the room look perfect, but at least some progress has been made and the most important thing is that the WalMart futon is out of there!!  Anyways, today is my first day of class and im not to excited about it, Even though officially my first class starts at 12:30 I have to go in earlier than that to try and fix some crap at the registrar's office and then go to the Economics of Strategy class in hopes that the professor will let me add it. Then tomorrow is my long day, I'll be in school from 11 to 4:30. It's weird, normally I'd be excited about the new semester but im not, I guess like Nicole Richie said 'im over the whole college experience thing, or whatever' i just want to graduate. The other thing i have to do is go talk to my last semester's professor; i keep thinking about Art History Grad School, i'd like to get an MBA in Art History, i think that would really make me happy. Work at a Gallery or Museum and put art shows together (curate exhibitions, i guess that's what's called). Anyways, i should probably get in the shower  if i want to do what i need to do today. wish me luck today",

Work of art and product of imagination, hope and excitement, most important of all it is a labor of love... the trousseau!  Trousseaus of old were virtual gardens of paradise, juxtapositions of thousands of colors, designs and flowers in which fruit, flowers, butterflies, birds and bees, and all the colors of the rainbow were immortalized. Passionate admirers of nature and its creative power and mystery, the women of Anatolia seem to vie with nature in their handicrafts. Their most exquisite embroidery and crocheting can be observed in the 'trousseau display'.     KIZ BESiKTE, CEYIZ SANDIKTA   Eski geleneksel yasamda sandik ceyizi, kiz bebesinin dogmasiyla baslar ve genc kizin evlenmesine dek surerdi. Bunun icin de 'Kiz besikte, ceyiz sandikta' denirdi.  Sandiga ince bir don konurdu; kiz 'donansin' diye. Bu inancin nedeni, ceyizi az olan kiza 'Sen bize donsuz geldin' denmesidir. Bu sozleri hicbir kadin duymak istemez. O nedenle kiz bebesi dogar dogmaz sandiga don konmasinin nedeni budur.   Ayak bileklerine kadar inen donun pacalari nakisla bezenir. Donun lastik yerine gecen uckurun da iki ucu ayni sekilde bezenik olur. Don giyildiginde uckurun isli iki ucu karin uzerine duser. Iste bu uckurlar uzerine sembolize edilerek nakisla resmedilen desenler, dogurganligi, bereketi, aski, gucu, saglikli olma istegini dile getirir. Anadolu'nun bereket tanricasi Kybele gibi... Resimlerin bir kisminda goruldugu gibi; renkler, bitkiler, cicekler, dallar, budaklar, yapraklar, hayat agacini temsil eden ornekler, bazi meyveler, arilar, kuslar, yilanlar, akan sular, Osmanlica yazili dualar yasamla ilgili bircok konuyu dile getirir.    THE GIRL'S IN THE CRADLE,  THE TROUSSEAU'S IN THE CHEST   In the traditional life of olden times, the hope chest was started with the birth of a girl and continued right up to her wedding day. Hence the expression, 'the girl is in the cradle, the trousseau is in the chest'. The first thing to go into the chest was a pair of bloomers that the girl might be properly decked out.   Owing to this belief, a girl with a small trousseau was said by her in-laws to have come 'without bloomers'. No woman wants to hear such words. Consequently, a pair of bloomers goes into the hope chest as soon as a baby girl is born. Ankle-length, these undergarments are decorated with embroidery as are the two ends of the drawstring that dangle over the belly when the bloomers are worn. Like the Anatolian mother goddess, Cybele, the embroidered patterns symbolize the desire for fertility, plenty, love, power and health. As you will see in some of the pictures, the colors, plants, flowers, branches, leaves and representations of the tree of life, as well as various fruits, bees, birds, snakes, flowing streams and prayers in Ottoman script give expression to many aspects of life.

SKILL OF THE HAND, LIGHT OF THE EYE   As the outcome of such diverse beliefs, traditional trousseaus were produced in the home through the creative power of women's handicrafts. Spinning wheels, looms, shuttles, embroidery hoops, crochet hooks and needles all contributed to the preparation of such trousseaus, as colored silk and gold and silver wires were threaded through the eyes of needles and the light of the maker's eye fell over the whole.  Among the traditional types of embroidery, some such as satin stitch and 'broken wire' are done with fine gold or silver wire. All of them, including petit point, cutwork, drawn work, chain stitching and the French knot, are done on an embroidery hoop. Another form of embroidery, also done by stretching the fabric over an embroidery frame or hoop, involves threading the needle with strands of colorful silk and knotting them around the counted threads of the fabric.   Still another type of embroidery, 'tel kirma' or 'broken wire', is done by stretching a piece of gauze-like colored fabric over a frame and weaving thin silver or gold wires over and under it to form a pattern which is the same on both sides. The embroidered pattern is then pounded into the cloth with a stone. Eye-catching and sumptuous, this embroidery is used frequently for bridal veils.     Cigerdelen, kasnaga gerilen beze bir noktadan geen igne evresinde renkli bir daire olusturur. Igne ve iplik ayni noktadan getigi icin ortada gzle grlen bir delik olusur.

Iste boyle yillar icinde hazirlanan 'el emegi goz nuru' ceyiz sonunda gorkemli bir sergiyle topluma sunulurdu.   40 GUNLUK SERGI   Bugun de onem verilen bu toplumsal ve sosyal gelenek; kadina el sanatlarinin tum dallarini 5-6 yasindayken ogretmeye baslardi. Egitmenleri anneleri ve cevreleriydi. Boylece el becerileri gelistikce, yaslari buyudukce kizlar arasinda ornek, desen, renk, cesitli oya turleri uretme yarisi baslardi. Boylece gencler ceyiz sergilerinde yeni buluslarini topluma sunarlardi. Bu buluslar islemelerde sonsuz bir desen zenginligine neden olurdu. Ve bu ceyiz 40 gun gezmeye acik tutulurdu. Boylece kadinlar, kizlar arasi kultur alisverisi saglanirdi. Aynen bugunun sanat galerileri gibi topluma hizmet verilirdi. Bazi ceyizler toplum uzerinde oyle iz birakirdi ki, yillarca unutulmaz ve oradan kopya edilen islemeler surer giderdi.   In 'petit point', a circle of color is created around every spot where the needle pierces the fabric, which is stretched on an embroidery frame, to produce a perceptible aperture. A woman's power of imagination, search for beauty, and mysterious inner world could spin incredible fantasies, as if the flowers of happiness in the garden of her heart had bloomed in color on her trousseau collection. Undergarments, outer garments, bridal veils, towels, napkins and handkerchiefs-she adorned them all with embroidery. And so the trousseau, 'skill of the hand, light of the eye', that has been years in the making is finally presented to the public in a magnificent display.   A 40-DAY EXHIBITION   Starting at age five or six, girls were instructed in all the branches of women's handicrafts, a social tradition still valued today. Their teachers were their mothers or other women in the household and community.   As the girls matured and their skills developed, they began to compete with each other to produce new colors, designs and stitches, inventions which were then presented to the public in their trousseau displays. Their inventions resulted in an infinite richness of design in Turkish embroidery. Such exhibitions, which were open to visitors for 40 days, fostered a cultural exchange among women and girls, performing a social function similar to that of art galleries today. Some trousseaus made such an impression that they were remembered for years and the embroideries seen there copied over and over again by successive generations.     BAHSISSIZ EYIZ VERILMEZ    zenle hazirlanan eyiz zel bir trenle alinirdi. Eskiden at arabalari, atlar, develer yrelere gre hazirlanir ve hepsine anlar baglanirdi.

The trousseau assembled with such pains is transported in a special ceremony. In the old days, camels, horses and horse-drawn carts were decked out according to local custom, always with bells attached. Whoever heard their unmistakable tinkle knew that a trousseau was on the way. Nowadays motor vehicles are decorated, and honking horns have replaced the bells. In mid-morning a mixed group of men and women from the grooms side arrive at the brides house to fetch the trousseau, which they load onto the vehicle they have brought for the purpose. When they arrive, the brides younger brother or sister is perched atop the hope chest and will not give it up without first being given a tip.   In the end everything is settled amicably and, together with the chest, the brides close female relatives set off in a procession to the grooms house to lay out the trousseau, a task which is always given to the women from the brides side. The walls of the bridal chamber are hung with the hand-embroidered garments and embroidered inscriptions. Displaying the trousseau demands expertise, and there are always women in the community who possess the requisite skill and knowledge. When the exhibition is ready, the trousseau party begins with consumption of food and beverages and the playing of games. This ceremony concludes with wishes for a long and happy life lived amidst plenty in the newly set-up household.     Bir hafta sonra gelin gelince dogruca eyiz odasina alinir. Damatla gelinin beraberlikleri bu odada baslar. Sonraki gnlerde isteyen gelir eyizi gezer.  Geleneksel bir eyiz sergisini gezerken, kadinin dnyasinin ne kadar ince, sanatkr, renkli, piriltili, zarif, yaratici, ssleyici, gnes gibi, ay gibi, yildizlar gibi ruhlari aydinlatici oldugunu dsnrsnz. Bu duygular iindeki kadin el becerisiyle, gnl zenginligiyle nasil bir cennet yaratmistir gerdege girecegi odasinda ve yataginda, yoku var ederek... Kadin yaratir, dogurur toprak gibi...   When the bride arrives one week later, she is immediately ushered into the trousseau chamber, where the new couple?s life together commences. Anyone who wishes may come to see the trousseau in the days that follow. When viewing a traditional trousseau display, you realize how refined, artistic, colorful, scintillating, elegant, creative and decorative the world of woman is, illuminating the soul like the sun, moon and stars. Suffused with such emotions, women have created a virtual paradise in their bridal chambers and beds with their manual dexterity and rich imagination, creating something out of nothing. Woman creates and gives birth, like the earth itself...",
        "scenario": "In traditional Anatolian society, girls from the age of five or six are taught embroidery and other handicrafts by their mothers and female relatives.

        "blog_text": "Much of the morning today was spent thinking about a man you just could not meet every day. Bill was not even his real name. For some reason he just seemed to look like a 'Bill,' so that's what everyone called him. When I met him on W High street about 10 years ago, he was about 74 years of age, and he was kneeling down outside his home pumping up a flat tyre on his bicycle. I can still picture him now. About 5 foot 2, with grey hair and glasses. He looked at me, and I looked at him and there was this silent moment of recognition. Then he said the most fantastic opening sentence, 'Oh, I'm just pumping up my tyre!' and he slowly nodded to me as he said it, just in case there was any doubt. I was caught off guard by his simplistic and patently obvious statement. Now,  that  was the way to start a conversation. Draw people in with intrigue. Why did he say something that I already knew? I could see he was pumping up his tyre. But, that's what Bill was like. He'd never go the predictable generic route when you talk to people-Oh, talk about the weather, or ask the person how they are. He always liked to throw you a ball you couldn't catch. 'What do you think about this?' he'd say, as he pulled out a newspaper cutting. Everyday, that I saw him I felt more and more of an affinity with him. He didn't do, 'small talk.' Bill would always be pottering about in his back garden when I called. I'd open the gate to access the small block of flats he lived in, and hear the sound of his footsteps, and immediately it would make me smile, because I knew he was there and we could talk. He'd just say, 'Richard...,' and then launch into whatever he had been thinking about. Gradually, he allowed me more and more insight into his fascinating life. He often talked about the war. He'd worked in Royal Ordinance and had built bombs. However, he never talked like many war veterans, bandying phrases like, 'Fight for your country,' or 'bring back national service,' he saw war for what it was-a terrible and evil cloud that discoloured humanity. The thing that I remember most about him though was his complete disregard for following any specific pattern or formula when it came to conversation. That's how conversation between friends should be. No falseness, or formula. Whatever entered into Bill's head, he just went with it. We'd talk for about half an hour every day on subjects like friendship, history, family, village life - all sorts of things. Anything he learnt from a book, he wanted everyone else to share in that knowledge, so he told them, whether they liked it or not! I wanted to believe that Bill enjoyed our conversations as much as I always did. If I ever arrived early or late, he'd never be there, which made me suspect he was lonely and deliberately found something to do in his garden when I called. When I left, I asked my replacement about 6 months later how Bill was doing, and I explained where Bill lived, and all my replacement could say was, 'Who's Bill?' They'd never even met...  For me, he was quite simply a man who you did not meet everyday. I still wish I could talk in that pure, undiluted, straight from the mind manner that was his specialty; unrestrained and unburdened from the custom and social expectation of tedious conversation. He died several years ago, and I miss him. I think it must of been my colleague Heather Cartwright's sudden death last weekend that got me thinking about the past and the people that I've known. I've known some wonderful people.",

We were walking through the park by Lloyd's center to catch the Max downtown -- Ezra running ahead as usual -- when a homeless guy caught my eye.  Head half shaved, half dyed, metal sticking out of various holes all over his face, tattoos all over his arms and face, classic punk clothes.  Early 20s.  You can see him in your mind's eye, I'm sure.    He was sitting on the edge of the sidewalk with a piece of cardboard in front of him.  On it was some of the coolest looking craftsmanship I have ever seen.  In his hands were a pair of pliers and a small chain that he was making, fastening little metal rings together.  Also in front of him were two other pieces of cardboard that had been neatly lettered in black and silver ink: 'Hand Made chain malle jewelery' and 'Don't just walk by.  At least take the time to say hello.  I'm not invisible.'    That second one caught my eye.    I called Ezra back and stooped to see his wares that were spread out for sale.  Using needle-nosed pliers he was forming intricately patterned chains out of all different sizes of copper and steel wire rings.  Perfectly even in size and perfectly shaped, the rings were connected to form bracelets, necklaces, and keychains.  He didn't look up.  I thought of telling him that it was really cool stuff and leaving, but decided to see about striking up a conversation instead:  'How's it going, man?'  His voice surprised me -- nasal and so quiet I could hardly hear his words.  'I'm kind of discouraged.  Nobody's buying anything.  Everybody stops and says, 'that's really cool stuff, man' but nobody's willing to buy anything.'  Hmmm.  He told me that he had learned his craft from a friend of his from Alaska and that he was more than willing to take special requests.  He could make them seamless, fastening them permanently around your neck if you like so that the only way to get it off is to cut it off.  Don't worry about the copper, it's great as long as you don't get it wet.  Get it wet and it will turn your skin green.  His hands were busy with his work the whole time.  People don't understand, I'll work with budgets.  It's not like it's that much to pay for something that takes so much work.  At least I'm not just begging, you know?  I make the clasps by hand, too.  Except if you want it seamless, then there's no clasp.  I made one for my girlfriend, a big thick one for her neck.  It was real nice -- I could have sold it for forty bucks.  I picked one up and fingered it in my hands.  This was some of the coolest stuff I have seen in a long time.  I asked him the prices and he pointed out the $10 bracelets, the $15 necklaces, and the $5 keychains.  I cursed inside at my lack of money to spend.   I couldn't say strongly enough how much I wanted to tell him that I appreciated his art, that I wished I had a basement for him to work in, that maybe I could help him get set up to sell his work in a shop for what it's actually worth instead of for the pittance he's getting.  I wanted to tell him how much he is loved and how much value I saw in him and how much there is out there for him to experience.    Instead I handed him a five dollar bill for this piece of handmade craftsmanship:     Melissa handed him the apple she had been saving in her bag to stave off morning sickness later and we left.  Sometimes you just wish for more, I don't really know what else to say.  And sometimes you need to turn those wishes into action, and you don't do anything about it.

        "blog_text": "Quarter-life crisis\nEto na nga ata ang krisis na kinakaharap ko sa ngayon. Sa buong buhay ko, ngayon lang ako nafrustrate ng ganito. Kung meron mang peak ang frustration ng tao, ngayon yun para sa akin. Nanonood pa lang ako ng TV kanina kasi kakagising ko lang. Tapos, biglaan na lang, sumagi na naman sa isip ko ang mga bagay na isinasantabi ko. Yun bang pag-evaluate sa naging buhay ko sa lumipas na 2 taon. Reality check kumbaga. \nBigla na lang sumakit ang dibdib ko. At ilang minuto pa ang lumipas, lumuluha na pala ako nang di ko namamalayan. Hindi ko maipaliwanag yung sakit na naramdaman ko kanina e. Hindi ko na maalala kung kailan ako huling umiyak ng ganun. Pero ang alam ko, habang humahagulgol ako, hinihiling ko sa Diyos na bigyan ako ng direksyon. \nDireksyon. Yan ang unang kinaka-frustrate ko. Magda-dalawang taon na nung grumaduate ako ng B.S. ko. At magdadalawang taon na rin pala akong nagtatrabaho sa NIP. Subalit kung tutuusin, walang nagbago sa buhay ko mula November 2002. Walang manipestasyon na umasenso ang kabuhayan pati ang kaalaman at pagkatao ko. \nHindi naman sa umasa akong yumaman sa loob ng dalawang taon. Sa totoo lang, kung di lang talaga kapos ang pamilya ko, hindi naman big deal sa akin ang sweldo. Kung gastos ko lang ang pag-uusapan, kaya kong tipirin ang isang libo sa isang buwan. Ang mas malaking issue sa akin ngayon ay ito: Makalipas ng 2 taon, hindi pa rin ako lubusang nakakasiguro na tama ba ang lugar na kinalalagyan ko sa ngayon. Inaamin ko na nakipagsapalaran ako sa pagkuha ng M.S. degree dahil inakala kong wala akong pupuntahan matapos grumaduate ng B.S. Isa pang dahilan ay dahil sa ito ang karaniwang landas na tinahak ng mga ka-batch ko. Yun bang kumuha ng masters habang nagtuturo sa NIP. Pero ngayon napagtanto ko na di naging tama ang desisyon ko. \nHalos lahat ng ka-batch ko ay patapos na ng masters ngayong sem. Marahil isa pa ito sa kinakafrustrate ko. Higit sa inggit sa estado nila, mas umaangat yung duda sa isip ko. Pag tinitignan ko sila, para bang siguradong-sigurado sila na ang pagiging 'physicist' ang gusto nilang mangyari sa buhay nila. Samantalang ako, ni hindi ko talaga makita ang sarili ko bilang 'researcher'. Hindi ako kampante dahil alam kong di sapat ang alam ko ngayon (academic man o experimental) para ituring ang sarili na physicist. Sa katunayan, dahil sa mga ganitong realisasyon, ayoko na talagang tapusin ang kurso ko. Hindi ko rin nakikinitang matatapos ko ang thesis ko sa loob ng 1 taon. At kung papalaring matapos ko man ito, ano ang susunod na hakbang? \nIlan lang yan sa mga gumugulo sa isip ko ngayon na di ko masolusyunan. Kung sa tingin ko ay ayaw ko na itong buhay ko ngayon, may pupuntahan nga ba ako? Mas pipiliin ko bang magsimula ng panibagong landas kahit na konting pagsisikap na lang ay kaya ko nang tapusin ang M.S. ko? Mas importante ba sa akin na nare-recognize ang skill ko sa field na pipiliin ko? Kaya ko nga bang talikuran ang buhay sa Physics na 'kinagisnan' ko na dahil di lang ako masaya at kuntento? Mababaw lang ba ang pinanggagalingan ng lahat ng mga frustrations kong ito? \nKung kilala mo ang pagkatao ko, at may ideya ka sa mga prinsipyo ko sa buhay kabilang ang mga bagay na tunay na nakakapag-pasaya sa akin, malamang alam mo na ang sagot sa mga tanong ko. Ang balakid nga lang talaga, hindi ko maisip kung paano, kailan at saan ko sisimulan.",

        "blog_text": "Dusted Days 3 (1995)  I had gone for lunch with my parents. I do believe it was a weekend and if I am not wrong the lunch venue was either 'Ghim Moh' or 'Alexandra Village'. I cant remember which for the life of me.   Putting myself psychologically in the context of the story, I was definitely over influenced by the music I was listening to. Nirvana and early Pearl Jam. Very angry music. Very 'I'm misunderstood. Rebel yell', kinda stuff.   Plus, those years were pretty much the most powerful years of the Generation X/Grunge/Slacker movement. It seemed that in that generation, a kind of anti-establishment/anti-corporate youth ethos was created. Ironically, so much of the wave that took the Gen X/Seattle scene to the rest of the world required the use and channels of big business and corporate highways.   But I bought it. I bought the whole farm. Bought the 'I'm so angry at everything'-schtick. Living in Singapore, I was dissatisfied with many  things, examples,  1) Anger at the pecking order of my school, where I was almost constantly ostracised for being fluent in English where everyone else was fluent in a mother tongue. Between getting beat up, laughed at, shunned and every other kind of peer harrassment, I pretty much gave up on secondary education. There is little incentive to study when you are surrounded by brutes and your mind is preoccupied with not having to get throttled after school.      2) Anger at Singapore. Societal things seemed to irk me. Like the introduction of R(A) films, to the ridiculous bans on films and texts, to the overbearing authoritarianism and self-serving cronyism of those who claimed to be influential and free speakers of 'the Arts and Music'. That really got my goat. I remember being so angry when copies of Nirvanas In Utero album were sold in the major stores in singapore and 'Rape Me' was bleeped out and stuff. Things like that used to really get me into a furore.  3) Anger at my fellow sheep, I mean man. Lets face it. Singaporeans are generally meek when it comes to voicing opinions regarding Government behaviour and legislation. The sadness lies in the fact that the routine and manner in which the Govt has muted public opinion has become one where the public themselves have grown ambivalent to so many issues. Simply because either;   a) They are scared to be vocal,  b) They simply dont care enough to be vocal about it or;  c) They ostracise those who are vocal, hushing them up in a rhetoric of 'haiyah, why care? make too much noise go jail. Dont care lah, no big deal'  4) Anger at the cost of living. Singapore is expensive to 'Live' in. When I say that I mean, having a life beyond just being able to exist. Having enough to indulge in one or two favourite activities.  So because of these and a few other factors like my Dad getting shafted at work for being a good old 'Salt of the Earth' kinda worker instead of the brown-nosing intellectual who is useless in practical situations, and overall dissatisfaction in the quality of my life at that point in time, I said something which must have had some, if not a large bearing on where I am now.  I uttered the words (approximately)  'You know what Dad, and Mom. Why dont we just go. Why dont we just leave Singapore....'  I proceeded to present my argument, quoting my Dads disappointment with work, presenting the case of me struggling at school with my second anguage, presenting a pretty detailed version of some of the points that I highlighted above. It was one instance when I was not interrupted in my presentation of the case to my folks. I do not even recall any other time when I have not been rebutted, stopped or simply told off for speaking at such length on any subject of serious importance.  Essentially I 'character assassinated' Singapore. Using as many fronts as I could from macro to micro issues. Everything from the Social-Authoritarianism to the banning of chewing gum, to the disadvantage of those who were more artistically gifted rather than academic, in a place like Singapore. Singapore the evil PAP machine, Singapore the 'You cannot' society. Singapore the stifling, money-making, industrial machine.  'Lets just go, lets just fucking go'.  I had hit a nerve I guess, because for the next 8 years, my parents really fought tooth and claw for PR status in Australia. Application after application, tallying of points, seeing agents, medicals, repeated appeals, coping with changes in application policy on the Australian legislative side. A million and one things. Even till 6 months before we got the PR (Finally in 2003), we had no clue whether we were getting it or not. Writing to the minister even (Back when ministers basically 'aye' or 'nay'-ed visas for applicants)  I will sidetrack abit here.       During this time of course, I had the opportunity of studying in Australia. I was in Perth for about 4 years and then in Melbourne to live with my sister for awhile. It is an experience, studying abroad. I would recommend it to anyone with the means/desire to go.   Then I began to see the flipside of migration.   Being Asian, moving to a Caucasian-heavy country does have its issues too.   1) It will take a long time before Asians are well and truly regarded as first class citizens or residents of Australia (If that ever happens at all). Never heard a comment about Chinese and Chinese food yet? Come be a minority here, and experience it for yourself.   2) Because of Australia being a country that is supposedly very tolerant on issues, they do not penalise stupidity. It is not a joke. Stupid is rife here. You have social imbeciles and delinquents, spraying any damn public thing with graffiti, trash, slurs. You name it,you got it. People dont respect public property here. There is no fat jail/fine if you spit/pee/litter/vandalise/squat, thus you get public stupidity.  3) Where Singapore is a majority White/upper-blue collar country, Australia has more spread in social strata. And it has a welfare system. So you do have the homeless, drug-addicted, psychotic and simply-no-goods more present in society.  4) Crime. Forget about walking to 7-Eleven for smokes. Opportunities for weird shiet going on are there. Maybe not like New York, but still...  5) A longing for the sights, sounds and tastes of home. They will always be sensual longing for 'back home' like food, familar places and such.  So its funny when I am in Singapore and people dont ASK me how Australia is. They TELL me.   'Australia good right? Everything cheap over there, servings very big right? I heard Australia girls very pretty. You like Ang Moh or not? Marry one lah. House cheap, Car cheap. If I go I buy WRX liao ah..' And so on and so forth.  When I am in Australia, this happens, 'Food everywhere? Any time of the day or night? Wow! $2.00 for any kind of food? Thats awesome. No crime? No guns? No welfare? No littering? Get anywhere in Singapore in one hour? By public transport? Sentosa? Wow'.  And the Australians ask me if I liked it better in Singapore.  Truth is, neither feels like home to me anymore. Having lived in both places in spurts and intervals of 6 months to a year, I have found nothing truly feels like home anymore. You meet people, friends and just when you start to settle, you gotta go ,again and again. College, Uni, Mediacorp, Melbourne, Lycos, Melbourne again.  So do me a favour. Dont ask me which is better. Cause I always say the same thing.  Neither is better, neither is worse, The more I know about the subject, the less I know.  'Everywhere I roam, where I lay my head is home'.",

        "blog_text": "The thought just occured to me that perhaps I really do need to move home.  I have no doubt that things will start to turn around soon anyway.  But perhaps adding that safety net of ever present unconditional love will aid the process.  Of course there are many things which would have to take place.  I would have to inform my landlord of course.  I am not bound to a lease here, but they were kind enough to give me this apartment, and I am not out to betray that trust/kindness.  But on the other hand, perhaps I need to start being a little more selfish, and deciding what will make my life better.  Then of course, Mom and Dad would have to say yes.  And it is fair to say that most of my stuff would have to go into storage, and I would be happy to pay for that in place of the rent I am paying here.  It was just a thought I had.  In fact I have it alot.  Part of me just doesn't want to admit that my old psychologist was right.  That I am better off at home.  It is true that I hate being in the environment where people do things for me.  But I also hate being in the environment where I have all the control, it is because of that that I have spent the past 72 hours holed up in here fearing to go outside and to have to face people.  Aside from getting horribly unhealthy food I have stayed in, slept the long days, ate the awful meals, frustrated at my inability to stop myself, and yet pleased that I am succeeding in my own destruction.  Are there two me's, I sometimes think to myself.  Are there more?  What is it like to have more than one personality?  Must they both manifest in ways that are obvious to other people?  I'm not a psychology student.  I have no idea.  When you sit alone at 4am thinking these things, there must be something truly wrong with you.  I live out every day hoping that that one event will happen, that one thing that will change everything for me.  Of course life doesn't work that way.  Epiphany's are hard to come by, especially for those who seem to not want to have one.  Paradox, you say?  Well perhaps, although likely not in the truest meaning of the word.  But since I don't know the truest meaning of the word I can use it in this way.  So I call myself a paradox, either because I believe it to be true or because I think the word sounds cool.  One of the two.  The first thing that any counsellor or psychologist or what have you will ask you is 'How long have you felt this way?'  To which I answer always.  Or at least as long as I have memory, but it has been getting worse as I get older.  The follow up question is usually 'Why do you think you feel this way?'  To which I respond I don't know.  Because I truly don't know.  I hardly have the right to be this way, nothing particularly tragic has ever happened to me.  I don't know how I became this way, and I don't know why, and if I did know why...why on earth would I be seeking counselling trying to find the answer to that question.  More inane ramblings.  I'm trying to figure out if I should just stay up all night or should go to sleep and set my alarm early as though I were just going for a nap.  The problem there is that I know what will happen if I go to sleep.  I will set my alarm, and it will wake me up, and I will simply get up and turn it off and crawl back to bed, after having reset it for the time I need to be up to go to work.  And it will go off again, and I will turn it off, and I will rest my eyes, and low and behold I'll wake up with only 20 minutes to get to work on time.  That is what happens.  I am so predictable.  My eyes feel tired but that might be only from looking at this screen.  I slept for a very long time yesterday.

Without you these past two years, I know I'd still be back there listening to my parents fight or you'd still be dwelling on your grandmother's death. I might still be sitting at the top of the steps waiting for Allison to come back. Maybe you'd be back in your old house with the pool, shining your soon-to-be-taken graduation present. I don't want to lose the friendship we had but that's what scares me. When we started dating, we stopped being friends, I never wanted that. I still want to joke and laugh and giggle and wrestle like we did. I want to run to you and cry in your arms and know that everything will be ok and leave at the end of the night feeling better than ever, but maybe not so much. I wouldn't want to put you in any situation that would hurt you. And I'm sorry that the one time I decide to, it's this...but sometimes you gotta let it go.",

So lets be honest. Its often ugly, but its better than wrestling with it alone. I was raped & you think to yourself bo-fucking-ho. So many girls complain & cry about it & so did I. Believe me, I have spent more than my fair share of time crying, wondering why, going to counselor to 'talk about it'. The details are pointless. All that matters, is that for a while, I had my feeling of control, my sexuality & my pride taken away from me. So I became angry, a part of me still is. Its strange how you can be having sex & be somewhere else in your head. Anywhere but there, because apart of you is still scared, even though it happened years ago, these memories come flooding back, all at once. Afterwards sitting on the edge of the bed crying, telling him not to touch you. & trying to reassure him at the same time, that its ok, its not his fault, YOUR the one who is still fucked up, after all of these years. and I think to myself DAMN. How did this happen? How did I get here? Why can't I be close to anyone? Why do I feel so far away. Its like every time my parents would scream at me. I would go somewhere else in my head. A buffer zone, b/c there, they can't hurt you & they can't touch you. But the point to all of this is that I don't want this shit to define me. I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me. Worse shit happens everyday to a million different women. I just want to escape it. I can't watch movies like Gothika because they bring back fucked up memories. Its so hard b/c you want to be normal. To be able to watch these movies & then just turn it off. But instead it brings back associations that you buried long ago. I know I am going to have nightmares tonight. Sometimes I am really scared & I guess thats why I am so cold towards most men. Why I don't like for them to touch me, or hug me. Why I don't like to cuddle & I am distant. I refuse to let this shit define my life, but it sucks b/c every once in a while it comes back. You feel sick to your stomach & suddenly you are reliving the moments you always wanted to forget. I just don't want to relive this shit on my own, at times I want to reach out & talk to someone about it, so I could relieve some of the stress...but where do you start? It happened years ago, its over with, but just not for me.",

        "blog_text": "Today was supposed to be an easy day.. One more day on my way towards the weekend. I have been feeling so sick and tired and droopy thinking maybe I have mono. So today my grandfather passed away. He was eighty eight years old. He was all that I ever looked up to and all that I ever strove to be. I mean he was the icon. Frank Schubert was the last civilian lighthouse keeper in north america. He lived in a cottage house in Coney Island, Brooklyn, NY manning the lighthouse . He was quiet and humble, lived simple but was funny and classic in the old time way. He watched football and baseball and loved to go bowling or play golf. No matter how old he got he could still kick our butts. He was the biggest thing to me, he was the only one who I ever cared what he thought or mattered to. That may not make any sense but if you knew Frank Schubert you would know him as a guy who was always there willing to help you, not only by giving you money or food but by showing you how to work, to build, to fish or cook. I am so happy that I could spend all 23 years of my life growing up with him . We built picnic tables and benches, we built coffee tables and picture frames, we even built a dog house for my puppy. He taught me how to golf and bowl, always being patient with me and really guiding me, adjusting when I lost my temper. He was a real man and someone that I will miss for ever. It is rough knowing that my children and my brothers & cousin's children will never get to meet the man who was so bigger than life. All I can say now is that he is up in heaven with my grandmother who has waited so many years for him to come to her. I just wish people would know who he was all the good and the very little bad. He was stubborn and we have all inherited that trait from him and he maybe did things differently his way was not always the best and probably could have been better. Frank Schubert was always himself never bowing down for anyone and never giving up his stance, no matter how wrong or right he was. He was a beautiful artist, creating masterpieces of woodwork, and paintings. I finally feel like man, maybe his passing is forcing me to stand up and move up in the world.. or maybe it is just giving me the strength to harness my power and talent and creative mind and go out and become the man he wanted me to be. I love frank Schubert and must say that he will be missed forever by me and by many other generations to come. Rest in peace and may st.peter and jesus welcome you with open arms.   Liz sent me this prayer and I wanted to share it with everyone so that they can remember to keep Frank Schubert in their prayers.   O Christ Jesus, when all is darkness and we feel our weakness and helplessness, give us the sense of Your presence, Your love, and Your strength. Help us to have perfect trust in Your protecting love and strengthening power, so that nothing may frighten or worry us, for, living close to You, we shall see Your hand, Your purpose, Your will through all things. Amen.",

        "blog_text": "MOPSY 1 Wandering aimlessly seems to be a thing of pleasure for her, these days. Marianne’s sense of romance lets her connect collapsing in a graceful pool of cloak and limbs with skinning the soles of her feet on a hot sidewalk, and getting one more concussion from fainting along the way. Her hallucinations and the wild heat aid her. She smiles faintly when I struggle to pick her up, fluttering her hand at me as if to say she cannot do it herself, but that it is not worth the trouble. I think she is worth the trouble, and know she tries not to grunt when I put her across my shoulders and carry her home. Sometimes the walk home is very long, and I see that it is a large distance she has walked. Then, there are more and more frequent pauses as I stop to catch my breath, and listen for her slow breathing. Sometimes she has only just made it around the corner of our street, and then I turn around to see the curtains falling back down, the neighbors pretending not to have been watching. I would not look at them if I were Marianne, but I think she does. I think Marianne sees a lot of things I would not want to see if I were her. When she is back on the drooping couch, she does not look at me. I intend to fix the sofa; I will give it proper cushions with full ends and upholstery that doesn’t remind us of nineteen eighty-two. I will take away the brown-flowered curtains in her bedroom, and find clean white ones to go in their stead. The rugs should not be faded, the bed should not sag and creak the way it does, and there should be neither linoleum nor a plastic table cover in the kitchen. Marianne never thought that being an invalid would mean old red and green and beige and pale blue flowered sheets to hide the stains from when she could not keep herself from coughing in the night. She did not think there would be coughing in the day, too, and that some of it would be done in bed. I never ask her why she walks barefoot out the door sometimes, so long that I must go find her. I would not want to sleep on a tired, springy bed with stained sheets either. I do anyway. Finally, Marianne looks up at me from the couch. I am sitting in the armchair across the room, watching her and waiting for the present moment. She wants to ask me what we shall do this afternoon. Anything you like, I can say, giving her the decision. She will not be able to make up her mind, and we will turn the cushions backward on the sofa to redistribute the old fluff inside. There will not be anything worth watching on the TV, and we will be admittedly too lazy to pull out a CD player, so we will just sit. My arm goes around her shoulders, she slouches against me, and everything is just the way it ought to be. I will have to push her away, then, because her skin is too hot and I am afraid that I will begin to burn if she does not let go of me soon.  Sitting on the sofa this way will only make new sofa memories over the old ones, and I do not want to revise the past. I will not suggest or move or even look to sitting with my arm around her on the left and left-middle gap cushions because I remember when her skin was cool. She did not cough so very much then and coughing rubbish up was rare. Marianne and I are quite well matched, I think. The neighbors say so, and they laugh. Mr. and Mrs. Chotky have their prejudice intact, but I happen to know that Marianne is not going to ask me what to do this afternoon because she does not want me to pull away from her. She knows what I am thinking. This is good. Even fevered people can be soul mates. Even fevered people can read minds, if they could before. There are many things that Marianne can do, these days. She can walk half a mile, in shoes, without fainting. She can, usually, dress herself. She can manage our calendar; every so often she will update it with colored crayons to mark the days in which we will go to a park or a museum or Ikea to sit on the furniture. I am teaching her to make pancakes from the bag, and she is teaching me to bake brownies from the box. Sometimes she has trouble with the flipping and the mixing, but that is why I am here. My arms are fairly strong, she says, though my culinary genius does not yet extend beyond pre-packaged food. I try not to remember that she does not have the energy to stand and work for longer than it takes to make boxed brownies. She particularly likes the interval between opening the box and eating the brownies, when she can watch me become befuddled and laugh. You’re learning, she says, you have to be the one to sort the process out. I laugh too, of course, and if the brownies are miserable because I forgot the yoghurt this time, we laugh again. She can laugh a lot, these days. One day, I bring her a book that I have bought in the subway station on the way home from work. I have a part-time job in an architect’s office as a kind of gopher, only they pay me more because they know my girl is terminally ill. We deny that it is terminal, but accept the money anyway. Perhaps someday I’ll get a real job there, and move up the totem pole? Twenty-six and I’m only starting off. I think we’ll be okay. Marianne protests that she is not okay- She does not really want the book I brought today, or the cards from yesterday, or the disposable camera from the day before. She wants me home, of course, she wants to be well again, and she wants a bottle of Lysol to clean her sheets with. I tell her that she might not want Lysol for her sheets, but she is adamant.  In the end, we strip the bed and dunk the sheets in Clorox. We soak and drown and inundate the sheets with Clorox. The sheets are now slightly closer to white than they were before, but have mostly faded into beige. She is begging me for brooms, for vacuums, which we have, and for heavy duty window cleaner and ammonia based cleaning products, which we haven’t. Formula 409, while probably toxic, does not smell the same way ammonia does. It is also advertised as biodegradable, and I thus see it as a good investment. Marianne does not think that Formula 409 will rid her house of the old invalid smell. Twenty-six and this is how it ends, she says. Then she looks at me solemnly, and points out in all seriousness that she intends to scrub her soul of disease with ammonia. I do not want to laugh, because she may honestly intend to wash herself with floor cleaner, and if I laugh she will swallow it just to spite me. This must be stopped. I snort accidentally, in the effort to breathe calmly through my nose. Again, I snort a little, and my mouth is twitching, so is hers, she is laughing a little, then I am, and then we both are, as ever. Marianne flips to the first page of the book I have given her and shows me that a) it is a romance novel, and b) the main character is intending to scrub her soul with something or other. She had begun reading while I was searching for Clorox, and found it devilishly amusing. I begin to wonder if she is honestly as tired of living in a sick house as I am, or if she’s only made that up to use a line. Shame upon me, because of course she’s tired of living here; Marianne is here more often than I am. Marianne is always here. On Saturday morning, I make a feeble attempt to sleep past nine. I do not like venturing into the real world at 6:45 daily to make money- some days I am still a teenager. Marianne is a teenager too. 8:45 AM and she is sitting on my bed, considering shaking me awake, considering staring at me until I wake up, considering doing neither, and finally just staring out of sheer nervousness that I might die if she shakes me too hard. You are fragile, she says. I wake up, of course, and ask her if I have kicked her in the night. You are fragile, I say. Then I want to kick myself, because of course she has her own room, own bed, now, with Clorox-ed sheets. I must kick myself again and again, to remember that I am not going to forget sleeping with her nearby when her skin felt white and her rubbish landed in the pot by her pillow. It is all right, of course; a slip of the tongue at 8:45 is forgiven by her because we are going to make pancakes again. She will be a fast learner and a fast talker when she gets tired. Marianne has stopped getting cranky when she is tired. She is tired often, I think. When we are getting ready for bed, Marianne often sits on the bathtub ledge to watch me brush my teeth. She is very philosophical, then. You know, she says, having toothpaste on your nose is like having banana on your chin. Here, I want to laugh, but doing so while brushing my teeth opens my mouth dangerously wide. I think that’s why she says the things she does, to see toothpaste dribble out of the corner of my usually neat mouth. She strikes me as so young, then, or at least so fun. It’s funny that you connect the two, she says. Twenty-six and that’s just where we are, love, twenty-six. She pauses, and I stare at the mirror, brushing heartily away; thinking. I can’t say I’ve learned something from her. There is no lesson from her sickness, and I don’t want there to be; lessons mean closure, and we’re not finished yet. We’re going to make her well, we’re going to move across the country, and we’re going to be young and beautiful doing it. I grin, and lose a little toothpaste out the side of my mouth. I think we’ll be fine, I say. Twenty-six is a good place for us.",

        "blog_text": "I have made a decision.  It took a long, hard think but I finally made my decision.  I am not voting for President Bush.  Part of the reason is his policy towards homosexuals.  He claims to be tolerant and mindful of equality for all, but it just doesn't jibe with the evidence.  The man has shown no tolerance towards homosexuals.  He has done this through simple inaction and a refusal to even acknowledge their existence.  He refuses to even mention the terms 'gay,' 'lesbian,' and 'homosexual.'  The President ignores them and treats them as though they don't exist.  How can you truly care about a person's rights and equality if you don't acknowledge them?  But this issue is only one of a larger problem that has arisen since the beginning of the Bush candidacy in 1999.  With President Bush's election came the ascension of the Religious Right.  The Religious Right has always been a part of the Republican Party ever since the late-1970s.  President Reagan's election helped establish them as a prominent wing within the party, although they were not one of the dominant wings.  The wing became dominant with the 1994 congressional elections and the retaking of Congress by the Republicans.  The rallying organization at the time was the Pat Robertson brainchild known as the Christian Coalition, then headed by Ralph Reed.  At the same time several leaders of the Religious Right published books, including Our Hopes, Our Dreams: A Vision for America by Gary Bauer, Steeling the Mind of America (a collection of essays by prominent members of the religious right), and Ralph Reed's own book Contract With the American Family: A Bold Plan.  This was the high point of the Religious Right's influence.  They were the influence in the Republican Party and one could not even dream of being elected without their approval.  But the 1996 reelection of President Clinton saw the slow decline in the Religious Right's influence.  They hurled everything they had against President Clinton, the one person they saw as the leading example of America's moral decay, and they lost.  It was a big blow to them, but it would not prove to be the last.  The largest blow came in the disastrous results of the 1998 congressional elections, which saw a major shift against the Republicans in congress despite forecasts to the contrary.  This resulted in the resignation of the champion of the Republican cause, Newt Gingrich.  With this defeat the already weakened Religious Right shrunk back to the prominence it held when it first entered the political fray in the late-70s.  Despite their decline, they remained in the background.  They were still an influence in the party, but they successfully operated under the proverbial radar.  Many simply ignored them, considering the group defunct and out of the picture.  After much concern I even declared them gone.  We were all wrong.  They never seemed to play a large role in President Bush's campaign, but it has now become apparent that they were operating in the background there.  One should have expected this with President Bush's declared religious beliefs.  Now reports have surfaced of Bible studies being held in the White House on a regular basis, not to mention Attorney General Ashcroft's fundamentalist beliefs and the Bible studies that have accompanied him to the Justice Department.  Then there's the social conservatism that has permeated the Bush Presidency.  It is completely in line with the Religious Right's views.  The best example of this is not only Bush's silence concerning homosexuals and homosexual issues, but his endorsement of the Federal Marriage Amendment.  The Federal Marriage Amendment would codify, in the Constitution, that marriage shall only be between a man and a woman.  At least, that is what has been claimed by its advocates.  In actuality it is much more.  The FMA actually states, 'Neither this Constitution, nor the Constitution of any State or Federal law, shall be construed to require that marital status or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups.'  Supposedly President Bush and other supporters of the FMA believe civil unions and other contracts are perfectly fine, and that only the institution of marriage should be reserved for men and women.  If this is so, however, then why outlaw 'legal incidents thereof?'  The current language would make not only gay marriage illegal, but civil unions and all other contracts between homosexual couples as well.  This betrays the true beliefs of the FMA's supporters, as well as President Bush's.  Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas recently wrote in the National Review Online, 'If the movement for civil unions and same-sex marriage succeeds, we may well be dealing a fatal blow to an already vulnerable institution.'  They can claim no more that the only target is gay marriage, but all legal contracts that would give homosexual couples the rights heterosexual couples have.  The FMA has no chance of passing.  There are too many opponents.  But was it always the true intention of the Religious Right, its most ardent supporters, actually to pass such an amendment?  According to its most prominent members, no.  Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council recently said in a New York Times interview, 'Social conservatives are looking at this issue so we know who needs to be educated on this issue or removed if that is possible.'  The goal was never to win the vote, although that would have been an added bonus.  It was a measure used in the goal to remake the Republican Party into a fundamentalist Christian party.  It is designed to bring about the transformation of the party into something resembling the Constitution, American, and American Heritage parties.  Their conservatism is focused on the social aspect, one that would use the government to enact and enforce what they deem to be the morals of America.  These morals would, of course, be based on their brand of 'Christianity.'  This will destroy the party.  It will relegate it to third party status.  That is unless a resistance movement can be formed.  It is unclear whether this will be done since this is an election year and many Republicans fear that any deviance would cost them.  Many have already declared their resistance.  The rest can walk a fine line and use the Religious Right, then betray them after the elections.  But the Religious Right is still acting stealthily.  The upcoming Republican Convention is filled with moderates and liberals.  This has been designed by President Bush and his advisor Karl Rove to show the nation of the Republican Party's diversity and the broad support for President Bush.  The Religious Right has already expressed concern over the lack of representation, but this concern has been lukewarm at best.  I'm not unconvinced that this is some sort of ploy on their part; some sort of deception on their part designed to conceal their coming coup d'etat.  The only way of stopping their plans may be the defeat of President Bush.  Unfortunately I don't see that happening.  The worst thing that could happen is a Bush landslide, which is what I feel will happen.  If this is the result come November, it will be interesting to see what happens when the Religious Right declares victory and comes out into the open.  The lines are being drawn, and the resistance is forming.  The Republican Party has some great moderate voices, including Giuliani, Hagel, McCain, and Schwarzenegger.  I only hope that they take a stand and rally their supporters to fight the coming civil war within the party.  If they don't, then the party will be doomed.",

Psycho-analyze away, but it helps me to talk and it helps me to feel that I don't have to keep something as a deep dark secret.  Jessica and I were talking about what our biggers 'what ifs' were, and this is what I said:   Leading up to that day I wasn't feeling great at all, I mean physically too, not mentally, but my parents didn't help, you could go up to them with a bicycle halfway up you ass and they'd still send you to school... my marks weren't very good either, despite me getting tons of extra help from my friends... I had just failed two big tests in math and I knew my final mark was going to be crap.   And around then some of my friends were really cutting into each other and I tried to step in a be a peacemaker, but then it just ended up getting them all ganging up on me...   So I was feeling pretty crappy, and on top of all of that Reena and I had been fighting so I was pretty volatile around then,..   The thing that set me off was this huge fight I had with my parents the night before, they're going on and on with me cause I complained about my brother and sister saying shit about me and that backfired big time cause then my family ganged up on me ...   So it really felt like everyone was against me and I had my back against my wall, I was physically and emotionally exhausted, so I took the cleaver from over the refrigerator that night and I took it to my arm.   Two and half hours later (that's how long I went at it), I was lying on my bed with my blood all around me and my head spinning from the loss of blood, and like I said, all I was thinking about before I went unconscious was 'God damn, god damn ... Reena' and then I slipped into unconsciousness...   It was sort of surreal when I was unconscious because it was like I was aware of something, but not something in this world, it was like I was in limbo or something, idn. I felt like I was suffocating like I was being crushed before I went unconscious, but after I felt just like, empty.   I don't know, but when I woke up that morning it was a scramble to cover up all the blood on the sheets, because my parent's would have finished the job if they saw the blood.   I don't know, all I can think of in retrospect, is 'what if I had? how would it have made Reena feel?' God damn, it would have hurt her so very much...    To move forward, I think I really have to take a look at my past and look at it long and hard, to see what I've done wrong.  A lot of my past has remained my evil in a closet, something I didn't want to touch and something I didn't want to remember.  But how can I learn the lesson I am to learn from my past if I don't reflect?  I still don't know what I was supposed to learn from my suicide attempt though...  I was reflecting back on it, and these lyrics fit the mood and feel of that memory well, I think:   'Scuze me while I tend to how I feel These things return to me that still seem real  Now deservingly this easy chair But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair  Don't want your aid But the first I've made For years can't hold or feel No, I'm not all me So please excuse me While I tend to how I feel  But now the dreams and waking screams That ever last the night So build the wall, behind the crawl And hide until it's light So can you hear your babies cryin' now?  Still the window burns Time so slowly turns And someone there is sighing Keepers of the flames Do ya hear your names? Can't you hear your babies crying?

I was six the last time I was at a funeral.  My Grandpa Joe, whom I didnt know all too well but always gave me Oreos, was sick and passed away.  I remember the coffin and eating M&Ms. My other grandparents took me home early because I was trying to get into a fountain.  So I guess when I went to my other grandpas memorial last week, I expected to be told to leave halfway during the service.  I did most of my crying before it started, right after I noticed the sign that said, Service for Charles A. Buel, December 12, 2003.  Thats also my dads name and I totally freaked out.  And then I thought I saw my grandpa walk in, but it was really his best friend, Chester.  I told my mom and she started to cry.  (I would like to point out that she cried/practiced origami on tissues during the entire service, even though she said she was done crying before we left the hotel.  She is a liar.)  My dad gave a good eulogy and didnt cry.  Chester had a Top 9 list of things people remembered about my grandpa.  I looked really good (this comes into play later, when I captured the hearts of several old men).  It was a nice service.  The reception was at my grandmas house.  The bartender had just had his esophagus removed and his assistant had two hearing aids.  Revered Temme hit on me and were taking a trip his native Australia soon.  Harold the Flirt was all up in my business, as well as the business of my mother and Mrs. Temme.  Chester took me aside to tell me about his granddaughter living in sin with a boy in Italy.  There was so much food (SO MUCH CAKE!) and a lot of bad vodka going around.  (My grandfather used to put crappy liquor in nice bottles because he said the old people around there didnt know the difference.)  Grandpa would have had a good time.  Isnt it sad that the time you spend grieving with family is the time that the deceased would have enjoyed most?  Our splintered little family, barely held together by marriage licenses and very little blood relation, finally quit hating each other and had a really good time.  It turns out that we were just fighting over Grandpa all those years.  Its a waste, really.  There are pieces of him all over the house (and I dont mean actual pieces  his ashes were at the funeral home; Grandma didnt lose him like we thought).  His diabetes kits are in the guest bathroom; liquor dating back to my parents wedding is still in the garage.  Nobody who really knew him well sits in his chair and there are golf clubs all over the house.  It felt like he went out for bagels, running an errand or two.  I could hear him say my name and feel his puckered kiss on my cheek; I saw him sitting next to my dad and holding his hand at the service.  All of his friends, most of whom I hadnt ever met or hadnt seen since I was very small, said that he was so proud of me.  But really, its me whos proud of him.  I just wish he knew.",

Through my times in high school thus far, I’ve come to the obvious conclusion that I, Jeff Kammerman, am a stress addict.  It’s really not a chosen habit, but rather one, it seems, I can never avoid.  Through a twisted, disturbing combination of perfectionism and procrastination, I manage to turn seemingly simple assignments into the Ironman Triathlon.  A worksheet, put off until the period before it is due, suddenly becomes a frenzy of desperate writing, yet I can’t do a mediocre job of it.  Every answer must be checked, every ‘t’ crossed and ‘i’ dotted as the clock ticks down to the last seconds.  Finally, the last question is answered as the bell rings, and I can breathe.      Now, you may be asking yourselves, “Why on Earth does he care that much about a worksheet?” and in truth, I usually don’t.  I’m too relaxed, laidback, some would go as far as lazy, to let a minor assignment worry me to that point.  But, ironically, it’s never the minor ones I put off.   It seems to be the journals, the papers, and the projects always become night before endeavors.  I’d like to clear something up though – it’s not only in English class that I procrastinate, just usually.  And that is not because I don’t care about this class by any means; rather, it’s because I do care.  Procrastination is a strange, strange disease that, in my dealings with it, causes a person to reverse his priority list.  All pressing tasks are put on hold for things that don’t really need to be done.  For example, before I began the essay you are presently listening to/reading, I finished a Computer Science project, practiced my horn, enjoyed the company of my friends, and took my dog on a long walk.  If I hadn’t had been procrastinating a major essay, that would seem to be a fairly productive day.  But of course, that would be too good to be true.  I had only delayed the inevitable, and in the back of my mind while I pretended to be industrious, I knew my time was ticking down.       I wish I could explain to you why I procrastinate, why I bring all this stress upon myself, but I honestly can’t tell you.  Instead, I’ll share with you the time-tested excuses that have served this purpose long before I began procrastinating.    The most popular of these is the ever famous “I work better under pressure.”  We’ve all heard it, and I’m sure some of you have used it yourself.  However, this excuse is just that, an excuse.  I know I would do a much better job of something if I began it weeks in advance, checked it, edited it, and added the final touches for its presentation to the public (or just Ms. Liscum).  But, if I start it the day of and work late into the night, my sense of judgment is a tad bit impaired.  I’ll think an essay that’s not (to put it colloquially) a piece of crap, is A+ material.  It is seemingly my finest piece yet, and I did it under a time constraint of a day.  I guess I do work better under pressure.     Also, I’ve been fond of the “I’m afraid I’ll do a bad job” excuse.  This logic just doesn’t add up.  I’m worried that I’ll do badly; therefore I’m not going to do it until as late as possible.  This way, I’ll have a good excuse if it’s a mess.  “That paper, goodness, I threw that together at 10 o’clock last night.”  It’s as though a person’s procrastination gives him/her the right to do a horrible job.       The worst part of these excuses is that they’re usually not told to other people – they are saved for myself.  I use these justifications to let my lazy side convince me I can put it off.  Major essays, journals, Region Band audition music, and even simple worksheets are put off as long as possible, because after all, I work better under pressure.  I should know better by now, but it seems I’ll never learn.",

I consider politics and religion two very touchy subjects. And so while the driver complains about the increase in gasoline prices or FPJ losing the presidential race, I just nod my head, give him sympathetic looks but absorb everything he's saying. As one who studies consumer research, it's highly important for me to be observant of these things.  It's also difficult to engage in a discussion with the driver, as my opinion is most of the time poles apart from his. It was especially hard during the election fever. I would just bite my lip and listen to the driver campaign for FPJ. Though I wanted to do my part in convincing him that there were better presidential bets, I just kept my mouth zipped. After all, my life was in the hands of this stranger driving the car.   This morning was no different. The taxi driver complained about the fare reduction in the other regions of the country, complained about how the jeepneys had it going great for them. I listened to him intently as a researcher. But there was one more thing he said that struck not my brain anymore, but my heart:  'Kaya nga ako, nagpapasalamat na ako na wala akong sakit. Kahit na maraming problema diyan, basta walang sakit, masaya na ako. Basta nakakakain ng tatlong beses isang araw, nakakapamasahe, basta walang sakit. Pinapasadiyos ko nalang.'  I looked at him and wondered if he was an angel in some way. It was as if he was telling me exactly what I needed to hear. I myself have been pretty preoccupied with problems such as budgeting, our furniture, my yoyo-ing weight... but when he said those words, I felt my heart ache with a bit of shame and optimism at the same time. Here was a man who had not lost hope. Here was a man who strived hard everyday. Here was a man who was thankful for things we normally take for granted.   He was right.

Reasons I am quitting smoking: \n-Smoking is not a 'sin', but a Christian who smokes is not a good example to friends, family and others . . . I want to be able to share my faith with others and not be embarrassed or feel guilty about smoking.\n-I want to be free from addiction in my life.  I don't want any substance or sin to have control over me.\n-I will save approximately $50 a month - money I could use to buy CD's, books or other fun stuff\n-I don't want to feel like a 'second class citizen' anymore\n-For my health and to have a better quality of life\nIf you've quit smoking before, what worked well for you and what didn't?  I haven't really tried to quit before.  I was really sick with strep throat 2 weeks ago and, as a result, I didn't smoke for 6 days.  I decided it would be a good time to quit because I already had one week behind me, but I don't think I wanted to quit bad enough.\nWhat improvements and changes can you make?  I can go in the office or out on the balcony to study and do homework\nWhat will be your most challenging situations, and how do you plan to handle them?  My wife does not want to quit smoking.  I know she will help me to quit and support me in any way she can, but the fact is that she is still going to smoke.  It will be hard to resist smoking when I see cigarettes and cigarette boxes (full or empty) around the apartment.  When she smokes around me, it will be difficult to resist casually lighting up with her. Driving in the car, I will have urges to smoke ... but if I don't have cigarettes in the car I will be okay. Going out to the club and when I drink . . . I should stay away from those types of environments for at least a month\nWhen I'm at home with not much to do on the weekend ... I plan to take up eating Ben & Jerry's ice cream more regularly again.  If I am really fiending for a cigarette I will eat some nummy ice cream, followed by some kind of activity to make myself busy (homework, going for a walk, playing with the cats, going for a short drive, playing computer games maybe?) \nAt school, I might be tempted to go out for a smoke between classes or on break ... I will not allow myself to go outside where the smokers congregate during school.\nWhat can you do to change your environment to promote breaking the associations you have to smoking?  Avoid going out to the smoking area on breaks and lunch at work\nTalk to my wife about not smoking around me and not offering me cigarettes (not even giving me cigarettes if I ask for them)\nWhat do you like about smoking?  It was new and interesting when I started 2 years ago\nAt first, I liked trying all different kinds of cigarettes and I liked making my own cigarettes (sort of a hobby)\nI like smoking when I drink . . . I don't know why, they just kind of go together\nPart of me likes the rebellious aspect of smoking and being a smoker\nI like casually smoking while I read, study & do homework\nI like smoking while watching TV - I used to not even watch T.V. but now look at me ... debauchery!!!   \nI like to drive with my windows down and good music turned up loud while I have a cigarette\nI like the social aspect ... do I really?  What does that mean?   \nWhat do you hate about your addiction?  I hate the smell of my clothes and wondering if other people think I smell like an ashtray . . . I don't think I do but ... \nI am 26 years old and a married adult, but my parents, family and in-laws don't know I smoke (or maybe they do?).  I hate hiding part of my life from them.  It's such a stupid little thing in my mind, but I know it would make my parents and family very sad if they knew I smoked.\nI think I'm a fairly intelligent person, but smoking is bad for me and a horribly stupid thing to do.  I feel stupid knowing how terrible smoking is, but I still do it anyways.\nWho can you count on for support?  My wife will help me in any way she can (sans-quitting herself), I know she will stand behind me in anything that I want to do.\nMy friend, Darick - he smokes occasionally, but he's not a 'smoker'.  He will be cool with me quitting and he's someone I can talk to about it.  \nWhat benefits do you envision in your smoke free life?  I will have more money to spend on other things (CD's, books, coffee . . . maybe even put some in savings)\nI won't have to live with the guilt of being a 'closet smoker'\nI will have more energy and have a better chance at living a healthy life free from the complications that smokers face\nI won't feel like a bad Christian for smoking . . .

When it sees me coming, I swear, it must be all like, 'Oh, goody, here comes Denise... time to go on the fritz!' I mean, my computer seriously hates me! Now, I'm not exactly a computer person. I've never been what you'd call 'user-friendly' or anything. But, for the life of me, I cant think of what I did to make my computer despise me so much! Whoever set it up, instead of putting in anti-virus software, must have accidentally put in Anti-Denise software! I'm pretty sure The Purchase Orders Dept bought it used, which would explain why it's so darn screwy. Whenever I try to type in user information for a new call, the keys always get stuck. And whenever I try to get archive info for a current call, it totally doesn't want to let me into the program! I'll be waiting and waiting for, like, two minutes while it groans and grinds before, finally, the screen comes up. I'll be like, 'Well, it's about time! What were you doing, surfing the Internet?' And then there are the times when I'll want to print out an email from a user, and it simply won't do it for me. I'll be like, 'Come onnnnnn! Are you trying to give me even more curly hair than I already have?' I am telling you, if there's a meaner computer out there in the world, I haven't met it yet! Yup, that darn computer of mine is having a great big laugh at poor Denise's expense. Lots of times, I'll be online, e-mailing a friend or checking out the Dancing Hamsters if I need a pick-me-up, and the screen will just completely freeze. I had no idea computers could have 'one of those days,' but go figure! There's nothing I can do but unplug the thing, plug it back in, and start all over again. Don't get me wrong; it's nice to have a new computer. But sometimes I think I'd rather go back to my sweet old little one than spend all day fighting with Mr. Moody here. God I hate that bitch! Jesus Christ. Where should I start with this ignorant cow? Actually, let's start with me. I am a brand-new, state-of-the-art Dell Dimension 4100, although, if all you had to go by was Denise, you'd think my name was 'Tweety Bird Sticker Receptacle.' She's got me faggoted up like a 10-year-old girl's notebook. Never mind that purchase orders screwed up and bought this colossal ditz of a helpdesk operator more computer than she could ever possibly need for logging a call. (As if 40 unused gigs of hard drive are necessary to a reminder that a call is still open from the 11th.) I'm powerful enough to monitor a cooling tower, but that's not even what I'm bitching about. I'd rather be owned by some acne-scarred teenage girl who only used me to write shitty poetry, so long as she actually read the manual that came with me. 'Programmed in some anti-Denise software.' Holy, I want to kill her. I feature a one-Gigahertz Pentium III processor and 128 megabytes of RAM. And this broad is whining that I'm not fast enough. A Lamborghini isn't fast enough if you don't know how to shift, brainiac. And, believe it or not, you actually have to exit a program when you're done with it. Not just close the window. You actually have to select 'Close' from the File menu. Or, better yet, Alt-F4 on your keyboard. I'm not gonna take the fall just because you left RealPlayer, AOL Instant Messager, Microsoft Word, ACT! 2000, WinAmp, McAfee First Aid, and the sound- and video-card software all open, and you're trying to open Excel! All that stuff costs RAM, dumbass. Maybe if you'd check the system tray once a month. The precise reason I'm 'groaning and grinding so much' is that your stupid catalog of open programs is so taxing to my RAM that it forces me to open virtual memory, which is gonna be slow as hell no matter what computer you're on. And, hey, Denise, if you're having trouble with sticky keys, maybe you should think about not eating so goddamn many bags of crisps while you're at your desk. (This Einstein seems to think the area beneath my keys is a gateway to an interdimensional netherworld where crumbs are magically whisked away, never to be seen again.) Oh, and technical wizards who roamed the Earth generations ago came up with a magic fix-all for a printer that doesn't work: Turn the thing on. That cable connecting me to the printer isn't a friggin' power cable. You actually need actual electricity to actually flow into the actual printer for it to actually work. Now, as for system freezes: Maybe if you didn't install that gay-ass shareware inspirational-saying screensaver, you wouldn't have had so many software conflicts. But, with the damage already done there, you could at least hit Control-Alt-Delete and click 'End Task' to close down a frozen program. That's Control and Alt and Delete, all at the same time! Isn't that fascinating? Oh, before I forget: If I do freeze up, my reset button is located in the front. Press it and... voila! Do not unplug me and then plug me back in. Do you have any clue how much that fucking pisses me off? (Why did I even bother asking you that? Of course you don't. You're Denise, the world's dumbest helpdesk tech.)

Little did I know that my life would be changed forever... The dinner was fun! We had the whole restaurant to ourselves. Since we had a group of 30, F & A's didn't take any other reservations. We had a whole table of family - Kitchie, Damon, Heidi, Abby, Mike, Auds, Ben, and Alan's parents. Then a whole bunch of our Santa Clara friends came by and some Berkeley friends too! Dinner was pretty good... I had the 7-seasoned fresh catch (which was salmon that day). Towards the end of dinner, I see my mom and dad walk into the restaurant! I was really surprised, because when I left the house, they were already in their pajamas getting ready to go to sleep!!! So I was a little confused, but was starting to think of why they were here.... Hmm.... my whole family, Alan's whole family, our close friends, and Ben and Auds taking pictures all the time and even taking a video of the night?? Suspicious. Also, before I left the house, I heard Alan call Kitchie on her cell phone. Now why would Alan call her, I thought? And I was evesdropping when Kitchie tried to secretly talk to my mom and dad about 'something'. Anyway, after dinner, Alan stands up and starts making a thank-you speech. He quoted a poem on friendship and made a toast to all his friends, he thanked his parents and toasted them. Same to his sisters, MY parents, and MY sisters... And last .... GOD. It was pretty funny when he said 'God' because I, and probably a lot of other people, thought he was gonna toast me. But after thanking God, he started to tell the story of how we met 4 1/2 years ago... how his eyes didn't shy away when we first met, how he wanted to get to know me better, how I asked HIM to be my boyfriend when we were driving back from Jack-in-the-Box in Berkeley, how I am the 'wind beneath his wings', how he always asks me 'When are you going to ask me to marry you?'. (By this point in time, I kinda knew what was coming. I started tearing when he was saying all these things to me. I noticed that everyone on the sides was gathering around us, waiting with their cameras in hand for something to happen.)

        "blog_text": "Why is it when a person tries to make positive changes in their life they encounter resistance and criticism at every turn? I've been trying to put me first more often and I'm being called selfish or worse for my trouble. It's not like I don't do anything for other people. The opposite in fact. Until about six months ago I was doing too much for others and not taking care of myself. My hobbies, my needs, my desires were all pushed to the side to clear the way for the needs and wants of others. I never seemed to have time to myself. I was obviously such a push over it never occurred to my husband or in-laws I might have a problem with my Father in-law moving in for five months. I didn't have a problem when I was told 'a few days' but unless I'm not as good at math as I originally thought five months is much longer than a few days. Those five months were difficult for me personally and caused many problems in my marriage. I held on to my patience and my temper with an iron grip and even restrained myself from shouting my joy to the world when my Father in-law finally went back home. When my Father in-law left I realized I needed to make some changes for myself. It wasn't uncommon for six months to pass without me spending any time alone. I'm not talking about being the only person awake in the house. That doesn't count because I had to be careful not to wake the others. I rarely got to eat a meal without interruption and even bathroom trips were not private. It seemed every time I decided to relax by soaking in a bubble bath the entire household ended up in the bathroom talking to me or retrieving things they needed. Locking the door worked to a point but then I was treated to a door pounding 'Mommy, I need to potty' serenade and a puddle to clean up when I got out of the tub. Once or twice I lost my patience and my temper and ended up screaming that whoever walked through that door next would get a face full of water. When that happened I was always greeted with 'What's your problem anyway?' No problem I just wanted some privacy.   I made a New Year's Resolution to take better care of myself - physically, mentally, etc. I gradually changed my diet, replacing junk with fruits and vegetables then I squeezed in some exercise three days a week. I even bought a book of baseball tickets. The idea was to go ahead and pay for them so I would actually go to the games when baseball season started. If I waited to pay at the gate I didn't think I would actually make it to a game. I like baseball though I don't follow it as closely as others. I hadn't been to a single game since I got married because there always seemed to be something more important to do. I'm happy to report I have been to one game so far this season. My husband doesn't like any sports so I talked my brother into going to games with me. I got rid of 11 boxes and 5 bags of clutter. In March I participated in a Writing Life Marathon Challenge. I wanted to get back to my writing and the challenge helped me focus on finding pockets of time in my day that I could use to write. The challenge goal was 50,000 words between March 1st and March 31st. I wrote 63,230 and learned how to make time for things I cared about. All through that challenge I was making little changes. I claimed a corner for myself and moved my desk and filing cabinet there. I picked a corner in a room that isn't frequently used in the hopes I could use it to escape occasionally. I unsubscribed from email newsletters I never read, cleaned up my favorites list and deleted/blocked some toxic people from my instant message buddy lists. I stopped answering the phone every time it rang too. All those small things have really made a big difference and although I'm not finished changing things I'm already happier.  Unfortunately those changes invited criticism and rebukes from people close to me and people who know nothing about me. When I bought the baseball tickets I was scolded for wasting money. I considered that $50 an investment in me and was pleased with the deal I got. Paying at the gate 16 times would cost at least $96. I was told that money would have been put to better use buying things for my children. My children have closets and drawers full of clothes and more toys than they need. They are fed three meals and two snacks a day. I know this because I feed them. I tried to brush the criticism aside but it made me wonder if I was overlooking a more immediate need. I hated second guessing myself like that. I had just recovered from that minor incident when my Granny felt the need to attack me verbally.   She brought up the 14 months my Mother was homeless and told me I should go straight to hell for not honoring my Mother. She wanted to know what kind of person I was to let my Mother live in a metal storage shed that long. Then she told me I have been selected as the caretaker for my oldest brother should anything ever happen to my Mother. He's lazy. He could do more  than he does but my Mother enables him. I was told I need lessons in compassion and humility and the best way for that to happen would be for me to allow someone I thought was beneath me to move in with me. I have two older brothers. The oldest one I can tolerate in very small doses. The other brother is one of my closest friends. He writes poetry and shares it with me and he's the one I talked in to going to baseball games with me. Granny told me the younger brother won't be responsible for the oldest one because they would fight too much. I have a younger sister too. She wasn't selected as the caretaker because 'her life doesn't need to be disrupted.' As a final insult my Granny told me it was common knowledge I will be taking care of my Father if he should ever need it. Common knowledge to everybody but me. I was angry with my Granny and my Mother for planning my future for me. I was furious with my Granny for knocking down a door I didn't want opened. My Mother's 14 months in that storage building were painful for me. I spent many nights crying as the wind howled outside my windows and every day I dealt with the knowledge that I could change her situation with four words 'You can stay here'. It would have been easy to say those four words to her but it would have disastrous. My oldest brother was living with her and any invitation extended to my Mother was assumed to include him. I couldn't let him stay here. I had children to protect. He's a convicted pedophile so I never told my Mother she could stay with me. My friends sympathized with me and understood why I chose to let my Mother stay in that situation. My Granny told me I shouldn't judge my brother and that there is such a thing as being convicted of crimes you didn't commit. I didn't bother to tell her I think my brother really did it. She wouldn't have appreciated that. I know the victims. I know the details of the case. All 4 victims gave the same story in separate interviews without specific prompts from investigators. On top of that he plead guilty. I know I could have ended the conversation with my Granny at any time by hanging up the phone but I wanted to get it over with. Hanging up on her wouldn't have stopped her, it would have only postponed the conversation. When she was finished chewing me up and spitting me out she told me she had been wondering what kind of person I was and she didn't like the answer. I called the brother I'm close to and talked to him for a long time after my Granny finally hung up the phone. Talking to my brother helped but I still felt raw and wounded for a week afterwards.   During the Writing Challenge I participated in I read some negative comments about me. In the last week or so it became obvious few people on the board were going to meet the 50,000 goal. In reality I was the only person who did but others hit personal goals and it wasn't a contest anyway. I was lurking on another board when I stumbled across a post saying only one person was going to make it and that was because everybody else was busy with 'real jobs' or freelance work. I was furious at first. This woman had some nerve posting that. I may not get paid for taking care of my three kids 24/7 but it sure as hell is a job and I resent that opinion. I've had to deal with variations of the 'you don't get paid, it's not a real job' thinking over the past three years. When I did the challenge I wrote two or three hours a day, usually after the girls were asleep or when they were happily playing. I was never out of sight or hearing and I certainly didn't neglect them. Reading that post took some of the joy out of my accomplishment for a little while until I decide to assume she was just jealous.   My sister has called me selfish for refusing to babysit when it's inconvenient for me and for agreeing to keep her kid if she'll keep mine for the same length of time later so I can have a break. She wouldn't drop everything to keep my kids for me but she expects me to drop everything to keep her kid for her. It's what she's used to and she's making it clear she doesn't like the new rules. Hopefully she'll learn to follow the new rules soon. In the meantime I'm hearing 'selfish' or 'bitch' in the same sentence with my name more often than any other time in my life. It's actually funny sometimes.",

Here I hang on the edge of a cliff, swaying slightly with the wind, looking occasionally down to the blank depth below me. The ground is so exceedingly far below me that the colors of the landscape twist and turn, blurred into a marred image of the desert I have traveled and loved. The arms beside me are burned with dried blood from my callused, cracked hands, and I feel weak and empty. That drive to fight for what my life has become has leaked out of my being and slowly dripped to the dust below, the fervent will to survive has slowly left me as I become more and more tired and as my body seems to grow heavier and heavier. I came to be here because I had grown to despise the dank landscape behind me, yet I refuse to fall because I can't quite see the world below.   This is one place you can not stay. Eventually you will have to either crawl back on to the ground above you, the monotonous existence serving as the usurper of a life once vibrant, or you will have to fall and give your self to the land below.

I shed my masks, my facades, the costumes that have become my person; I stepped out of these self-made beauties.  And yet, it was not a loss. I had not given up to see my opponent laugh and fly with victory, I had simply made a move I had lusted after and feared for a long time. I allowed my body to jerk limp, thrusting my self into the cavernous space below me, twisting and turning. The wind blows against my bare back, beating me as I grow faster and faster until I reach terminal velocity and simply fall. I am terrified but free, scared but ecstatic to move my hands and arms and feel the beautiful elation that comes with change.   My release is anything but glorious, however; my eyes are drained and the vivacity that has possessed my face for so long is no longer present.

I haven't felt stable or secure since I told her that she had given up so much for a life I don't respect or enjoy, since I told her that I'm not sure I wish to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. My passion is this doctrine, this philosophy, the leaders and the community, but I cannot bear the sight of what my family has done for it. I could never live for this the way they do, I could never bear such unhappiness in the name of service. I love her and I quake in the sight of her ability to be truly selfless and live for her children, her family. I see the wisdom in her rules, in her kindness, in her passions, but I don't know if I want to live in Utah anymore. I don’t know if I want to live with her anymore. I don't wish to play for those at school that I work so hard to convince; I will not create for them. I create for no one.  I create for no one. I write for no one. I live for no one but myself.  Breath has never been this satisfying; the pain induced by this icy wind has never been more bittersweet upon my lips. The freedom to relax and to lie limp is mine, as I fall I can move in ways I never have before. My body, however, is still as lifeless as before, my eyes still tired and apathetic, glazed and fatigued. Even with this change, I am not excited, just curious: curious to see where I fall.",

I dare whoever's on this blog to read this article. And I dare you to read it with a mindset that is outside of your privileged, white, middle-class paradigm. Understand that you don't understand the issues here - you can't even begin to relate. So before you try to perpetuate this caste system we have in America, get your facts straight.   \nWhat If There Are No Bootstraps? \nAn Interview With Leon Dash About His Book, 'Rosa Lee' By Chris Harold    \nRosa Lee is the story of a woman who upon first glance personifies every stereotype regarding inner-city poverty. Washington Post reporter Leon Dash deals straightforwardly with many of the stereotypes without himself falling into an ideological category. Dash, who won a Pulitzer for the book, followed Rosa Lee and her family for four years, hunting for clues in the world of the inner-city underclass. \nDash follows Rosa's day-to-day struggles and traces her family history; what he finds is fascinating and heartbreaking. Rosa Lee's grandparents carry their bottom-rung social status and their sense of racially-limited options with them to Washington, D.C., where they seek to escape the harsh life of North Carolina sharecroppers. Uneducated and unskilled, menial labor and domestic work are their only means of survival and the grandparents pass this emphasis on to their children. The cycle continues as Rosetta, Rosa Lee's mother, educates her daughter by preparing her to survive the only way she's ever known, teaching her to wash, cook and clean. Dash thus follows an unbroken line of poverty up from the South into the vastly different circumstances of Rosa Lee's life in the inner city.   \nRosa Lee refuses the path of domestic work because she is unwilling and afraid to be at the whims of white employers. Then, acting in part out of adolescent rebellion, she becomes pregnant with her first child, Bobby, at fourteen. She has another, Ronnie, at fifteen, and then marries at sixteen. The marriage lasts only four months. In all, she has eight children by six different men. She begins shoplifting as a way to have nice things she can't afford. Her first contact with drugs is also the result of needing money. Of her eight children, two Eric and Alvin—somehow escape their mother's legacy; all the others follow her into drug dependence (Rosa Lee is a heroin addict), criminality, poverty, and in the case of her eldest son and daughter, the contraction of HIV. Her oldest son, Bobby, dies of it. Finally, in 1995, so does Rosa.   \nIn all this horror, Dash's book shows the mystery of sin and responsibility as it works its way through generations. That Rosa Lee and her family were sinned against is evident in Dash's tracing of the family's roots (the discovery, for instance, that Rosa Lee's older sister was conceived when her sharecropper mother was raped by a white overseer). Yet equally clear is that Rosa Lee also bears responsibility for her choices. As our understanding of Rosa Lee as a human being deepens, the inevitable questions come. We interviewed Leon Dash and asked him some of these questions.    \nDid your greatest shock come over Rosa involving her own children in crime?    \nWell, I was familiar with the oldest child in an underclass family becoming part of the parents criminal activity, or providing money for the family by some illegal means with no questions asked by the parents. But all of Rosa Lee's children were brought into her criminal activity. It was for what she always called survival. Rosa, for instance, would buy a brick of marijuana and her children, right on down to the youngest, would sit around the kitchen table and cut this brick into what is called dime bags.    \nAnd you found this to be true of other families, this passing on of criminal behavior?    \nYes. Its part of the Urban Institutes definition of the underclass, that the criminal behavior is generational.    \nBut you say Rosa Lee would call this her way to survive. Did her government assistance fall short?   \nI knew from a past project I had done on teen pregnancy that welfare assistance is not enough to cover the necessities of life. I had seen firsthand that these families on welfare would regularly have no food in the house by the end of the month. This was also true for Rosa Lee and her family.    \nIf the government made you poverty czar with full authority to change things from the ground up, what would be the first thing you would change?    \nEducation is the single most important thing. It has not been working and this is not just a blip in history. Rosa Lee went to school in the 1940s. She, her children, grandchildren, and now her great-grandchildren have not gotten an education that would help them. Three of her five grandchildren can't read. Rosa Lee dropped out of school in the seventh grade because she was pregnant. But pregnancy aside, could she do seventh grade work? No. She couldn't even read. The problem is that the educational system is approaching children from the inner city in a conventional manner, attempting to teach these kids as if they were kids from middle-class schools. The educators refuse to deal with the real educational difficulties these kids bring with them to school.    \nHow would you deal with it?    \nFirst, you can't put a teacher in a classroom with thirty aggressive, attacking, and profane kids and expect that teacher to teach. You have this middle-class teacher in with these kind of kids and they just drive her nuts. So, instead, have only five kids with a teacher. You must provide a situation where learning can actually happen and not just a teacher being the sergeant administering discipline and keeping order. And I mean this has to happen starting in kindergarten, not just junior high or high school.   \nBut when I talk about these kind of things, people get very upset. They say it is unfair to send a disproportionate amount of their tax dollars to go to support these underclass kids. Why should they? What I try to say to these people is that you're going to pay for it in other ways—in prisons, in police, welfare, or even by having your car hijacked.    \nThe poverty czar then would need to appeal to self-interest to see his reforms through?    \nIf this poverty czar proposes these kind of educational reforms, he'll probably have to resign before he's out of office. He will become a lightning rod for these issues people are angry about. It's like talking about religion or politics; opinions about this are really charged with emotion. People don't want to pay more taxes than they have to; they want to have more money for themselves. So a poverty czar would just have to know he'll never make it to the end of his term. The best he could do is raise these issues and get things moving in the right direction. But, of course, what we really need is the political will to deal with these kind of underclass issues. Right now we don't have that. We need to have people in politics who are willing to sacrifice their careers to deal with these issues.    \nCompassion could give us this political will, but how are we going to be inspired to this kind of compassion, especially in this time of politically scapegoating the poor?    \nI don't know. Honestly I don't. We need a charismatic leader, but we don't have one. I just don't know. I was giving a talk recently and a man stood up and said regarding Rosa Lee, Why are you so sympathetic with this person? He was one of the angry ones. I said that I didn't really see myself as sympathetic. I mean, I had learned about how Rosa Lee had prostituted her eleven-year-old daughter, Patty. Who wouldn't be repulsed by such a thing? Of course I'm not sympathetic to that. But, I said to him, I guess I'm just not as eager to condemn her as you. I can't judge her as harshly or easily as you.   \nThis man was one of the haves who cannot understand the have nots, who simply see people like Rosa Lee as morally reprehensible. These haves keep telling the have nots to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. I'm here to remind them, Hey, these people don't even have bootstraps! Give them a break!    \nSo the problem is that these haves don't understand that if they grew up in the same circumstances from the time they were born, they might not be the person they are today?    \nAbsolutely. I would not be who I am today had I grown up in Rosa Lee's circumstances. There's no way! And that's what I try to remember and tell others, Hey, there, but for the grace of God, go I.    \nWhat main insight do you hope the average middle-class American would gain from reading your book?    \nThat there is an underclass. That it is growing and it's a problem for all of us.    \nWhat practical steps could the average middle-class American take to help with the problems of the underclass?    \nMentor one child. Tutor one child. Alvin and Eric, the two of Rosa Lee's children who made it out of poverty, both had mentors (Gartrell Franklin and Nancy McAllister) who helped them at crucial points in their lives.    \nIf you could go back in time to when Rosa Lee was young, do you think that kind of intervention, mentoring, might have made her story come out differently?    \nIt's funny, Rosa Lee used to say to me, Mr. Dash, I wish I would have known you when I was younger. You could have helped me. But I would tell her that I didn't think when she was a young woman she would have listened to me.    \nCould you give me an example of how Rosa Lee's limited range of choices counter the simple solutions offered to her?    \nIn Rosa Lee's case, what jobs are available to her? She can't read. There are few jobs for you if you can't read. She can't work at any kind of hard labor because she's an older woman in poor health. So in a case like hers, simply moving someone off welfare will not guarantee he/she will get a job. People also don't want to deal with the history behind this, the whole history of racism that has played its part in lives of those like Rosa Lee. Fifty-seven percent of the underclass are black.   \nAn especially haunting moment comes when Rosa Lee remembers her grandfather who was a poor sharecropper from North Carolina. She recalls how he never laughed, and one day she asked him why. He says, We had such a hard time down in them sticks I guess I just don't see nothin to laugh about. And Rosa Lee didn't understand this answer.    \nRight. That shows how the effects of racism came down to Rosa Lee without her even understanding what happened to her. Her mother Rosetta raised her according to what she knew from growing up in the South, which meant if you were a black woman you learned to do domestic work to survive.    \nDoes racism continue to play a part in the poverty of the inner cities?    \nYes, it does. One explanation is that people see poverty as a minority problem. This I think is due to the fact that the main media are located in urban centers and the reporters are simply too lazy—quite honestly—too lazy to go out and show the other faces of poverty in rural areas. Although the majority of those in poverty are black, there is still a large population of whites who are in places like southern and western West Virginia, Kentucky, and also in the upper peninsula of Michigan. So then it's difficult to get funding for all who qualify for programs like Headstart, which is a proven program, because people don't want their money to go to what they see as a primarily minority problem.    \nYou point out that as we become more of a technological society there are less and less jobs for low-skilled workers. As a result future generations such as Rosa Lee's grandchildren and great-grandchildren, trapped in the cycle of poverty, will have even fewer opportunities. If there is no intervention in their lives, what do you see in the future for them?    \nI was quoting there from the Swedish sociologist, Gunnar Mydral. He predicted as far back as 1962, in a book called Challenge to Affluence, the emergence and growth of the underclass which we are seeing today. As far as what will happen in the future? The underclass, according to the Urban Institute, is growing at a rate of 8% (that was how fast it was growing at the 1990 census). Now some sociologists are beginning to refer to the underclass as an undercaste. That's because they see the dividing line as so definite, they don't see any way for movement out of that underclass. The divide is that great they don't see any solutions to this division. So this trend is growing and it's a problem that's not just going to go away. Also you must remember that these people in the underclass—2.7 million in 1990—they don't even appear in the unemployment statistics.     \nHow is that?    \nThey have never held a job long enough to be considered employed, or they have never been employed, so they aren't considered unemployed. So this group is not even represented in these important statistics. They're invisible.    \nNear the end of her life, Rosa Lee is received back into her childhood church with open arms. Do you see anything more that her church or churches in general could do for those in poverty?    \nYes, I think especially mentoring and tutoring programs are important. They can show a child another way of life they might never see otherwise. Mentoring and tutoring are two tremendous ways to help.",

(Psalm 86:1)  'For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.' (Psalm 109:22-24)   Every one of us must turn and face the fact that we are in deep Need!

We cannot expect God to heal us, refine us, or use us until we admit to Him our need.    I, as a homosexual teenager, had no more need than you do right now.  You are needy, broken, dropping flesh everywhere you turn.  Your eyes are wasted away within your head, and your bones are weak within you.  Fall down (it is all you can do) at the foot (feet) of the throne that is also a cross, and spit up your need.  He is waiting to take it.",

I am also not supposed to act like her daughter, 'the ball-busting career bitch', I am not supposed to show that I am pained by all this effort that I am making and she is not returning.  I told her that she couldn't smoke, and if she was going to, she was not to put out the special glass ashtray she truly believes is Waterford crystal. She was to empty my former bedroom of Camels, half-empty gin glasses, half-finished cross-stitching projects, and anything else that might be wont to cause me visceral pain. We agreed that none of the neighbors needed to hear about how large my brownstone is or how much I make each month, because it is twice the size of their duplex and twice what they make in a year.  'Elaine,' she smiles, flinging small flecks of ash into the forbidden ashtray, 'whatever happened to your marriage?' She knows what happened, she knows that I walked in on my husband sleeping with my 'administrative assistant,' that I divorced him and fired her and let go.

She looked like the duchess of some portion of the United Kingdom, with cheekbones that could slice meat. She never coughed, and when she had to, it was moist and delicate.  'I am looking for a sign,' she explains. I don't even ask because I know it. I know she's been drinking and she promised she wouldn't and that's just another thing in a chain of promises that never happened.

        "blog_text": "My mind goes blank sometimes as I sit and day dream about days gone by. I find it hard to believe I am now fourty eight years old and still living in the very same home I grew up in. My father is 76 years old and lives on the first floor with my oldest daughter who is now 22. My mother past away ten years ago. I honestly believe it was the hardest thing I ever had to go through in my life.   Growing up I wasn't very close to my mother. As a matter of fact we bucked heads a lot but as I grew older and had children of my own we became the best of friends. As a matter of fact there wasn't a day, in the last twelve years of her life, that my mother and I didn't have lunch together. I worked at home while I raised my family and my mother worked the 3 to midnight shift. It wasn't an easy shift for her but she did it all the same. She went to work to make a better life for our family when I was about ten years old. She stopped working about five years before her death. I still miss her every day. Now when I think of her I remember how wonderful it was getting to know her as an adult. I see the hard times she had to endure and I understand all she went through in her young life, her marriage and in bringing us up right.   I was married to my first husband for eleven years and I have to admit they were tough years. We had three children by the time we split up just six months after my mothers death. I knew it was coming for a long time. My only regret is it didn't happen till after her death. She worried about me everyday. That's why I think she made sure she saw me every day. She was afraid if she didn't something would happen to me. I honestly believe my mother was more than aware of the abuse and negelect I put up with every day of my life. My husband didn't know how to be a husband. He had no role model to go by since his father wasn't that great a husband either. People used to get so frustrated with me because I always went to his defense but I believed I was his wife and that is what a wife does. Unfortunately he didn't feel that was what a husband should do so he went about his business and enjoyed himself on a daily basis.   I think he thought I was oblivious of his extra activities but he was dead wrong. As a matter of fact the person who opened my eyes to his games was my mother. She found out he was cheating on me and instead of ignoring it she called me, had me over in the evening for coffee, and let me know what she knew. The rest of my family was there for support but they only screamed at me when I said I wasn't leaving him. My mother just stood there and looked me in the eye as if to say I understand. She told them they couldn't expect me to just walk out. She knew I how I believed in my marriage vows. I tried for years to keep it together and she stood behind me and supported me every way she could. I know she hated seeing the saddness in my eyes and she prayed everyday I would be free of him but ultimately it was my decission to leave or to stay.  I guess when my mother died I no longer had my best friend to go to who would make me feel better. I sat in my house night after night remembering her love and warmth. Anger grew inside of me because my husband was not home. The person who should have been helping me through the toughest time of my life was with someone esle and would return home as if nothing was wrong. One night, as I sat in my room alone again, I talked out loud to my mother as if she were there. I asked her to help me get the courage up to do what I knew needed to be done. I admit I cried for the loss of my mother and for my marriage but at no time did I cry for the loss of my husband, at least not the man I was now married to, the man he had become. Some how over the years he changed and became his father, cold, uncaring, and mean. I longed for the man I married but I knew he was lost forever. As I spoke to her I could almost feel her arms go around me as warmth encircled me. I knew then that she would always be with me and hear me as I speak to her. Even in death she gave me the courage to go on and not to let him destroy my life.   My mother was my best friend. She was always there for me. Even now I can feel her presence and her strength. I don't think I have ever met anyone stronger then she. She died, at the young age of 59, from lung cancer. Her fight lasted eight long months and I often think about the pain she endured. Even with all she was going through she worried about the well being of me and my three children. She made my father promise he would be there if we needed him and he was and still is.   Her support and love over the years gave me the courage to find myself and explore what I like about myself. That was some thing my ex husband was able to tear apart over the years. She encouraged me to go for a job as a pre school teacher which I did and I loved. I taught for five years before I had a car accident on, what would have been my mothers birthday had she lived, March 4, 1998. Since then I have not taught pre school but I have gone back to writing. I think my mother was the only one I ever showed my work to. She always encouraged me to move on it and believed one day I would get a book published if I just believed in myself. Now I have a wonderful husband who believes in me the same way she did and encourages me to work on getting my novel published. Over the past three years my children have started to read my work as well. I think next to my husband of four years, they are my biggest supporters.   If my mother was here with me today she would be my best friend and supporter. She would push me to do what was best for me and to take care of myself so I would be around for a long time. Whenever I feel scared or sad I think about her and I feel her presence all around me. I know she is watching out for us for I truely believe she is my guardian angel.   Just the day before my mother died I was in her hospital room with her enjoying an old Fred Astaire move. Mom was in a coma but I sat next to her bed and held her hand, talking softly to her about the movie. I talked and believed she listened because I asked her if she liked the music and would like to get up and go dancing. My mothers feet started to move as if she was dancing and I could feel her squeeze my hand. The nurse came in to give her medication and I told her what happened but she insisted it had something to do with her pain medication. I knew better. Before the nurse left the room my mother opened her eyes and pulled off her oxygen mask asking for Toni. The nurse asked me if I was Toni and of courses I said I was. I moved closer to the bed and tried to put her oxygen mask back on her but she fought me. She had to talk to me. Her eyes wide she took hold of my hands and looked me in the eyes to tell me she loved me. Those were the last words my mother, my best friend, ever said to me. She closed her eyes that day for the last time.   The next day she died at 6:30 pm just two days after Thanksgiving. I am so glad, thankful, I got to hear her tell me she loved me but more importantly I am thankful I got to tell her I loved her.",

We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.  We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.  We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added years to life not life to years. We've been  all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We've done larger things, but not better things.  We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.   These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete.   Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever. Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.  Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent.  Remember, to say, 'I love you' to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you.  Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again.  Give time to love, give time to speak, and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind. AND ALWAYS REMEMBER: Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.  If you don't send this to at least 8 people.... who cares? George Carlin",

Nobody nobody nobody! NOBODY!   I hate her. I hate her. I. hate. HER!   But I got what I wanted in the end. And it was magical.    She was on the stage, acting out one of the highlights of the play. Solo.    Perfect .   I regally walked to the stage, to where she was. You should have seen how I walked; the audience thought I was part of the act. That’s how great an actress I am. She had noticed me coming her way, so she stood up to face me. Uncertainty had clouded her eyes. I stopped a few inches in front of her. I took out my silver dagger. I buried the dagger into her abdomen.   She didn’t see it coming.   I felt her warm blood trickling down my hand after the dagger’s blade went in. It would have gone deeper, except that the hilt had blocked it. I felt elated… ecstatic. The blood inside me rushed to my head. I felt heady and wonderful at the same time. I felt my nerves come alive, making me aware of a thousand sensations… and more.   I twisted the dagger. She had groaned with pain, and that groan of pain made me want to do more. It beckoned me to do more. I stabbed. And stabbed… and stabbed… and stabbed. The audience gasped; they sat at the edge of their seats.    Finally ! I had gotten the attention I had richly deserved. I-   Where are you going? I’m not done yet! No one leaves the greatest magician of Midgard! No one, I say… NO ONE! Come back here you bastard! Come back this instant! If you don’t… you will pay! Oh, how you will pay! I will kill you! Kill you, I say!  No – don’t lock the door. I was just kidding. I didn’t mean to say that. Please… I’ve more to tell. Don’t… please don’t!   DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNN’T!            \nThe old man closed the door on the screaming young harridan with great relief.   \n“I tell you, Moinna. That is going to be the last time I’ll clean that crazy woman’s room.”   \n“It’s not like she’s going to bite you. The girl is chained with iron manacles, for Odin’s sake.”   \n“Who did she kill?”   \nMoinna adjusted her spectacles and looked at the old man with shrewd eyes. “It’s confidential.”   \n“I know that. But I’ve heard her say the same things over and over again ever since I’ve been assigned to clean her room.” The old man looked at Moinna with pleading eyes. “Please.”   \nMoinna hesitated.   \n“Okay… okay. The girl was supposed to be a lead role in a play. But, a week before the play, she started to act strangely. She was replaced by another girl, the one she killed, as a matter of fact,” Moinna took another breather before continuing.   \n“Rumor has it that the girl, the one she killed, had hypnotized her. My guess… that was the time  she  started to go crazy! What a pity,” she shook her head. “So… she killed a girl. Oh, I’ve heard of that. Wait…” the old man frowned. “So you mean the girl inside the room is the… is the –”   \nMoinna nodded and said regretfully, “…is the princess.”      \nEnd.",

        "blog_text": "Today I have one of my days off from work and home alone.  I decided to get serious about me and my future. For all who reads this please understand... that my future always includes my children. But I have to make me healty inside and out.  I know I can do this with my children living with me through it all. I honestly feel that if I am healthy then my children will be.    I tend to make these lists for myself to accomplish some of my goals and maybe one or two things on that list gets done. Currently, some of those things on that list need some real attention and I keep getting scary signs that I cannot ignore anymore. I am not happy with the way I am living my life or my health. The fence that I am on is getting to be a real bitch to balance anymore.  It is a false sense of balance. I do not reccomend this for anyone to live by. But in order for me to change and get off the fence I have to start with one step at a time. It's gonna be slow but I will do it.    First lets tackle my health. I woke up and sat down infront of my computer and I saw this thing I left as a reminder for myself to do. It is a reminder from my health insurance to have a mammogram done. I am 41 and have not had this done yet.  I know how wrong this is but I am scared.  I hear other women say how painful it is and I freeze. The thing that changed my mind today is a coversation I had with one of my customers this weekend.  She is a cancer survivor and her cancer was found early from her mammogram. She told me...'I put mine off too even though I knew cancer was in my family, I wised up just in enough time to have a new life that I am thankful for every day.'   Life is definately more important than being scared.   So I made my appointment today for next week. (the earliest appointment I could get) This is one step closer of feeling proud of me today.   The next step.  Why am I blowing off things like this that are so important to my life. I do know the answer to this one.  DEPRESSION! PRESSURE! STRESS! I need to dig deep inside me and pull out what is stopping me from moving forward with my life.   For example not getting my resume done.  Oh I typed one a million times but I destroy them. I see myself on paper and automatically put myself down. 'Whos gonna hire me. Too many holes in my employment.' I have asked for help from some family and friends with my resume but they can only help so much. I am the one who has to do it not them.    I cry alot more than I admit to anyone.  I hide alot of feelings. Only a few people in my life know how I really feel. Only one of them lives close to me. My personal life with relationships is horrible for me right now.  I really cannot talk about it on here.   So the step I made towards this today is I called a psychological center today to find a good therapist. I am waiting for a phone call back to make an appointment.  I need to be fixed. I need help.  I give up!  This is too much for me to handle alone.   Third step. Temporary things help me cope like purging.  I have been cleaning out this house throwing so many things out that should have been thrown out a long time ago. I have a rule if it hasn't been useful, played with, doesn't fit, is broken,or is ugly it goes out the door.  I find we accumulate alot of junk.  I have to give some credit to some of those TV shows that are cleaning out houses.  They have inspired me to clean out and get organized. It feels good to actually find a room that you can enjoy when all the junk has been thrown out. Very cathartic!   So today I would say is a three step proud day for me.",
        "scenario": "A 41-year-old woman is home alone on her day off, reflecting on her life, health, and well-being, and taking steps to improve both her physical and mental health.",

I realize I need help to get better for myself and for my children. Taking this step to call a therapist, even though it’s hard to admit I can’t do it alone, is necessary if I want to regain control of my life and start healing.",

        "blog_text": "Friday night... It was the eternal struggle between stupid and smart... Between good and evil... I lost...   I went out with Heather (here at work) and Jackie (nail-tech). We started out at a local sports bar, just a block away from Jackie's house. I drank 3 B-52's. They are sort of like Kahluha and Cream. I recieved 2 phone calls and had to shout to be heard.  We left there, went back to Jackie's house where I had 2 glasses of wine. I was waiting for them to get ready, because, let's face it, I'm as good-looking as I'm going to get at this point. You can't improve on perfection... right?   We went from Jackie's house to downtown Eugene. I had a boiler-maker (beer w/ a shot of whiskey) at Original Joe's. We walked over to Jogger's. I had a screwdriver and shouted obscenities at people who were sucking at karaoke. I still can't believe we paid a $3 cover to listen to people suck at singing. After 20 minutes, we left and headed to Quacker's Last Stop...   I made the mistake of talking to geeks in a Pontiac who asked me where the party was. Their faux ghetto was worse than mine. I told them the party was wherever we went, but they were not allowed to follow... They tried for a couple of blocks but gave up. I shouted obscenities at them as well. We arrive at Quacker's. Heather keeps calling her friend Mark, to get him to hang out with us. I'm guessing that I'm not enough for her at this point. Or maybe I am too much... This cute blonde that was outside of Jogger's talking to us is now at Quacker's. I'm convinced that she's a friend of either Heather or Jackie. Unaware of the power of being stupid drunk.   We sit at the bar; my stool feels like it's going to fall apart. I ride it like a bronco and order myself a Long Island Ice Tea. I'm sucking it down, telling the bartender that he's a fucking genius. Heather and Jackie are talking to the blonde about her loser boyfriend. He walks up and announces that he doesn't want to marry her, I feel like knocking his teeth out. Instead I quietly lean over to Heather and shout, 'He's a fucking loser!' Offended, he walks away, mumbling something extremely mature. His girl is in the bathroom sobbing.   This Albany Firefighter is hitting on Jackie. She shoots him down; she leaves to check on the blonde. The Albany Firefighter moves on to Heather, tells her that she smells like bubble gum and that he wants to chew her. She tells him to fuck off or something equally as brilliant. I ask him if being an 'Albany Firefighter' gets him laid a lot... Without waiting for a reply, I shout that I bet it doesn't. Disgusted, he leaves mumbling something equally as mature as the last. Heather leaves me at the bar, she's actually afraid of these assholes.   I continue to suck down liquid courage. Mark and 3 of his friends arrive; I hear the commotion, look over my shoulder and check them all out. I've seen Mark before; the other 3 are unfamiliar and equally unimpressive. I finish my 1st Long Island and stand at the table that they've arranged themselves at. I am now drinking water. I feel mouthy and buzzy but all together OK. I am introduced to everyone. Yes, Mark... Cheeser... Russ... Oh yes, this is Shawn... I shake hands with all of them, but my first impression of Shawn was... He has eyebrows like a bitch. I nearly said it, but he was being nice, I didn't want to fuck the group up. We got to talking. I was really into listening to Shawn. I have no idea why; he wasn't saying anything that was worth a fuck. He's sitting across from me. I'm spilling all sorts of information about myself, mainly the fact that I'm freaky as shit. He kept saying, now THAT'S what I call a lady! I still thought he had bitch eyebrows, but the alcohol was telling me to fuck him.   Periodically getting up to empty the bladder although, I can't really feel anything at this point, other than the extreme muscle cramps that are accumulating in my calves. He heads to the loo with me and we have our arms around each other. I can't remember ever looking at his face, which leads me to believe that I didn't care to. I decide that it's a good idea to get another Long Island because I can still pick myself off of the toilet. The night starts to get fuzzy... I suck down the Long Island and notice that Shawn has gotten himself one as well. I can't remember when, but at some point, he switched seats with someone and ended up next to me, first on my right, then on my left. It's when he was on my left that shit got nasty. Damn my ambidextrous hands!   When he was on my right, we did flaming Dr. Pepper's. I let mine get out of control, it started burning the table, Shawn was quick enough to dunk it into the bigger glass, and I downed it like a dirty bastard. Right after a toast of 'Are you in?' Various glasses of beer happened, I can't remember whose glass I was drinking out of, I didn't care...   Shawn was on my left now, a shot of something clear and bitey was in front of me... I still don't know what it was. I asked several times, was told to shut-up and drink it. This seemed logical, so I did. I felt my head lean over on his shoulder, I felt tired and sick. He smelled like my ex. I kissed his neck and my left hand landed on his thigh... Ooops, yep, right up to his package. I heard him say 'Whoa! That’s nice.' I believe he was just about as fucked up as I was at that point. I remember that I kept giving him a fun time outside of his pants. I was told later that I was talking dirty to him as well. Telling him that I wanted something hard for my birthday. This doesn't sound like something I'd say... Even drunk... I'm cleverer than that. I remember picking up his right hand, which he gave over without a fight. He was very willing. I started sucking his fingers. I don’t even know where they had been, fuck, that’s disgusting.   I think we were about to leave; everyone was over at the bar again. I followed. Stuck my hand right between the back of Shawn’s legs. A shot was set in front of me; I’m told it was a Creamy Nipple. I held my mouth. Shawn told me to drink it. I said, “No way dude; I’ve reached my limit.” I really had reached my limit, but it was about 5 drinks ago. I’m such an amateur.   I remember being outside with him at one point. I asked if I could kiss him. He said that it wouldn’t be right, that he was married. I said, just a peck then, a peck on the lips. I tried to figure in my head where he thought a kiss was out of control but getting an outside the pants hand-job was not… I still don’t see it.   We went back inside. I found Heather and shouted, “Don’t let me do anything I’m going to regret!” She asked, “What makes you think you’ll regret that?” I thought, what woman in her right mind WOULDN’T regret that!? I started wondering how the fuck we were going to get home. I was scared and felt so stupid for getting so drunk. I went to the toilet again and washed cold water over my face in a futile attempt to sober up. When I came out, everyone had gone.   I stumbled out to Heather’s car. I don’t know how or why Jackie’s petite little ass found it’s way into the front seat, but it did. I shoved myself in. Shawn between Heather and me. I was not in the mood for anything at this point. I had reached my zenith in tolerance, both with alcohol and with bullshit. The music was loud, Heather wanted to hear “Sweetest Thing”. I felt the gorge rising in my throat, but fought it down and thought of water and sleep… The next thing I know, I hear Heather shouting “No, STOP IT!” I look over to see Shawn has his hands on her tits. I pause in thought and then scream at him. “Knock it off you stupid fuck! She’s in love, don’t touch her! I’ll fucking kill you if you don’t stop” He stopped and patted me on the thigh, “It’s OK”, he said, “Show me some love.” I felt the tears streaming out of my eyes. “FUCK YOU!” I shouted. “She’s lucky, she has love, it’s beautiful, and she doesn’t deserve to get groped!” He was trying to calm me down, but I just wanted to rip his head off.   I remember shouting at Mark to slow the fuck down. Then we arrived at the security gate at his “community”. The drunken bastard in front of us couldn’t get his code in, we all laughed at this and Mark shouted out his window and told the guy he would let him in. The Camry lurched its way up onto the lawn. It struck me as pretty funny that we were in a gated trailer park… It seemed ghetto fabulous.   I was relieved to have gotten there alive. I knew that Mark was pretty fucked up; he admitted later that he shouldn’t have been driving. Everyone started vacating the car, someone opened my door. I think it may have been Jackie. As soon as I pulled myself out of the Camry, I noticed that everyone else had made it inside, other than Shawn. He told me that he wanted to “toss an arc” outside. I told him to piss on his BMW. He considered, then, told me he didn’t want to. I laughed. He was about to unzip his jeans when he got shy. I just let him know that he didn’t have anything that I wanted to see at that point anyway.   I staggered past him and felt him tugging on my shirt when I headed up the steps to the house. A blast of heat, it must have been cold outside, although I didn’t realize it. I immediately bent over to admire an extremely plump cat that wound it’s way around my legs. I could hear Shawn drawling on about what the deal was. I loudly announced there was no deal, there was just life and made my way to the biggest sectional couch I had ever laid eyes on. It looked like heaven and I was extremely focused on getting there and no where else.   Somehow, Shawn was standing next to me; I don’t know how the hell he’d gotten there so fast. He was asking me how I planned on laying down. Sideways or on my back. My response was, “Fuck, I don’t know.” I sat down. He whined, that it was very important that I tell him. I lay down on my back, someone handed me a pillow, I grunted in gratitude. I looked up at Shawn as if to say… you’re still here? I tell him he should back the fuck off and make to sit up; my left foot is all that hits the floor. He laughs, “That’s for traction!” I continue to ignore him, someone hands me a bottle of water and 2 aspirin, I tell him that he’s a god.   Shawn vacates the living room, wanders into the master bedroom where a waterbed awaits him. Soon everyone has picked a bed and or a bed partner and has left. Russ is the last to leave the kitchen as he is reading a newspaper; I’m guessing he’s the one who hooked me up with the water and aspirin. I make an attempt at conversation but only a grunt escapes me as I pass out.   I wake about an hour later; Russ was kind enough to leave a light on in the kitchen. I open up my mobile phone to it’s notebook and begin writing. I realized that I love you very much still. I just do. No compromising. You are the love of my life. Shaun .A.R. This took me about 15 minutes… I tucked my phone back into my pocket, feeling very satisfied with myself. I pass out again.   I don’t think I was asleep very long as the pulling back of my tongue woke me. I was scared, I was in a stranger’s house and I was about to vomit. I tried meditation… mantra: you will not puke, you will not puke… it worked for a short while, I sat up slowly… stood up slowly… started walking very careful not to jumble my insides towards the bathroom. There must have been some seismic activity somewhere on planet earth because my guts felt it and recoiled in retaliation. I puked all over the wall and front door and the linoleum patch. I heard it splatter and winced at the thought of having to clean it up.   I stepped away and towards the bathroom once more. I made it in, shut the door, flipped on the light… Oooo… bright… this must have caused some chemical reaction in my body because before I could reach the toilet, I filled up the sink. Then, as soon as it had began, it stopped.   I looked up at myself in the mirror. I had managed to vomit on my right boob and my hair was dank with it as well. I nearly started to cry as I looked over the bathroom and myself. Most of it had landed in the sink, which of course, was refusing to drain. But the smell, the sheer stink of it… it was just impossible. I made the brilliant decision to take off my shirt. My bra abandoned an hour before was tucked in my pant’s pocket. I rinsed the puke out of my hair and grabbed a towel off of the towel rack.   I made my way, half naked, back into the living room to try and mop up my expelled dignity. After franticly making the attempt and soiling up one bath towel, I threw it and my shirt in the washer. I went back with another towel and some carpet cleaner and went to work on the wall and the bit of carpet I had not aimed for. I stood up in disgust, I realized this was not going to happen, not tonight. I worked between that spot and the bathroom sink. It was now drained with a bunch of yuck in the bottom of the bowl. Yes, I had to touch it… I scraped it out and threw it in the toilet. I went back to the washer, which by this time had run it’s cycle and put my shirt into the dryer.   Exhausted, I made my way to Russ’s bedroom, he was gone, I would sleep there for an hour or so. I wasn’t about to go on the couch again, not half naked. I pulled my shoes off, landed on my stomach and somehow managed to pull a blanket over me. I heard someone get up and shut my door, saying something about wandering drunks. I later learned that Heather had asked Mark to get up and check on me.   6:24am, the door to the room I had landed in is flung open, Heather tells me that we have to go, Jackie has to go to work. I do not know how I mustered the strength to sit up and put my shoes on, but I did. I walked somewhat swiftly to the dryer, with a towel I had picked up somewhere around me to retrieve my shirt. Heather asked what the hell I was doing. I grunted that it was a long story, while in the little laundry cove, I struggled with the still damp shirt. I walked back to Russ’s room to get my phone off of the nightstand and noticed that Shawn had taken up residence on the couch. I felt very lucky that I had used the bedroom. On the way back out the door, I pointed at Mark and said “Flowers.” Then I added, “Kick Shawn in the sack for me.”   We all piled into Heather’s car and I began recounting the night’s events with my yellow fleece vest gathered around me. I think someone had a window open because it was absolutely freezing in that car. I was still drunk. I was nauseous, I remember thinking about driving home. I was silent.   Jackie mentioned stopping at Starbucks and I wanted to hit her in the back of the head. I just wanted to go home and continue sleeping, the less time I had to take in getting there, the better.   We arrived at Jackie’s house and I asked Heather if I could follow her part way home. She said she’d wait for me. I sat down in my car, started it up, immediately turned off the radio and cranked the heat up. I just thought over and over in my head, if I fuck up and get caught like this, I may as well shoot myself.   My car finally warmed up and the windows defogged, I crept out of Jackie’s driveway and followed Heather out of Springfield. Minding the speed limit the entire way and staying completely focused on the road in front of me as well as my surroundings. It was 7:30am. We parted ways around The Blarney Stone, she took I-5, I couldn’t bare the thought of driving faster than 40mph. I went with HWY 99. My hands were clenched on the wheel the whole way home, I arrived just before 8am…   I left everything in my car except my phone. I made my way in the house, used the toilet, washed my hands and removed my contact lenses, which I fully expected to be wielded to my eyeballs. Luckily they were not. I regarded myself carefully in the mirror, my hair still pulled back. My nose piercing had suffered, it was either puke or puss, I didn’t care which, I washed my face.   I made my way to bed, my dog sniffing me the whole time, I had failed to realize it. She was both extremely happy to see me and extremely put out because she had to vacate my bed. I lay on my side, her nose examining my feet and legs. I pass out.   I wake up at around 10am, gagging on the smell of myself. I decide it’s time for a hot shower. Nearly passed out in there, 30 minutes later, I wrap my head in a towel and pass out in bed again. I woke up when my mom came home at 1pm.   I feel better now, but I do not think my internal organs will ever be the same again.  I can't believe some people do this shit all of the time...",

        "blog_text": "I suggest you read this WHOLE story before you can call me names... And I think I should tell my story before you start to judge me...   I'm starting from what I can remember from July 3, 2001. Actually it started way before. My father and mother were constantly fighting. My mom and dad once in a while would come to me and ask my opinion on them getting a divorce. Of course I hated the idea. My mom told me that my dad had a problem; a problem with money. I didn't understand her at first, but afterwards, I knew. She also told me that 'they' were going to take me and my brother away. Later did I found out that 'they' was the government, because apparently the money problem somehow involved us. This is just the beginning though. My older brother and my dad had problems. I don't know what kind, but it always ended in a fit and crying. I would cry every night because I lived in what I would call a demented family.  On July 2, 2001 was my fathers birthday. My younger brother, me, and my father went out driving in the country just because it's kind of a 'thing' we did. But this time we almost drove to Iowa, which scared me for some reason. I had a gut wrenching feeling the whole day. We went back to Rochester and decided to eat at the restaurant 'Grandma's Kitchen' to celebrate my fathers birthday. Then we went home and my dad went to one of his daily meetings. My older brother had lock himself into his room, trying to avoid my dad. Once he knew my dad was out, he packed his bags and left. It was his running away from home. I was in the shower at the time; I got my info from my little brother. My dad didn't get back till after I was in bed, like 10-ish. He came into my room because he found out my older brother wasn't home. He was turning beet red; it's either because he was mad or about to cry. He asked me where he went. I said I didn't know. My little brother told me that he left with a guy, one of his friends I'm guessing, so that's what I told him.  The next morning was Wednesday, July 3. I was awake but sleeping at the same time. I heard a weird kind of choking noise. I thought it was my older brother coming home and crying into my dad's arm. But it was my dad crying. He kept saying he was gone, he was gone and I knew he was talking about my older brother because he never came home. Then my dad came to my room and sat on my bed and said 'You know that I love you, don't you?'. I just sat there and nodded. Those were the last words he said to me. My dad got up and got dressed. My mom was worried he would do something stupid. He was telling her not to worry. Then the phone rang. It was my brother. My dad went outside to talk to him. He was asking him to come home. Their conversation ended and my dad said he was going out. My mom begged him to stay. He still went, and that was the last time I saw him.  My mom was so scared that she had to call the police and told us to pack our bags. We were going to leave the house that I've been living in for the longest time. Then the police came. They were asking my mom questions and stuff. One of them came up to me and asked me how I was and stuff like that. Then she told us to go downstairs. I didn't know what was going on. My little brother was so upset that he couldn't stop crying. I told him everything would be OK. It was a very long time till anyone got us. It was my older brother who came to get us. I was so glad to see him, but that was my two seconds of happiness. We went into our living room and there were all these people I've never seen before. I went and sat next to my mom. One of the police men kind of looked up and said straight forward 'Your dad has passed away.' I burst into tears right after he said 'away'. That was the hardest and longest I've ever cried. I thought that I would never here those words until my dad was really old. But at fifteen years of age, I heard them. I found out that my dad committed suicide; that he threw himself under a moving train. No one told me, so I had to find out from the newspaper. I've never been happy since.   Because of my dads death, we had to deal with his money problem. He was over $10,000 in debt. We had no way of pay this back because we were poor to begin with. So we had to go through this whole legal system to sort it all out. We would constantly get calls everyday and night from credit card companies, wondering where their money is. Now it's been reduced to once every 2 months, or not even. We're still struggling with money, but we're surviving.  So before you think about suicide, or that you hate your parents, or that you have a bad life, think. Don't judge people. Ever since this incident, I had to get counseling. I was known to have depression, and still do. It's no joke, because depression can deprive you of so many things, like my dads life. Because he had depression, he just felt like he couldn't live anymore. It's so hard for me to tell this story because I've never told anyone before, not even my closest friend. I'm trying to choke back tears, but it's to hard. I sometimes think that I should have died instead of him, but I know that I still have friends and family to back me up. So I've told my story, maybe this time you'll understand not to judge and call people names.",

        "blog_text": "Ouch.  Sunburned neck.  I always think about putting on sunscreen; I realize the dangers of skin cancer .  My dad had skin cancers on his neck and hands which were, fortunately, treatable.  But in the time when he was exposed to the sun continuously, people didn't wear sunscreens.  Plus, he was fighting a war in sunny North Africa and Italy  and didn't really have much time to think about slathering on some SPF.  But I do resolve to be more active about putting some on rather than just thinking about it.  Keeping some in the car might be a good idea.  Duh.  I love auctions.  I'm almost addicted to them.  My favoritest of auction companies is Braun and Helmer .  Dad took me to them when I was very young and I thought that it was like a toyland of 'stuff'.  Dad also taught me to wait for a good bargain all the time.  So auctions seem to be a sort of raison d'etre for me to find a good bargain.  Saturday I got a 32' Quasar TV for $110 and Sunday I got a garden tractor with a drag, mower deck, and front blade for $150.  It's an older tractor, a Sears model, and it's been pretty well maintained.  I went to the auction on Saturday with an idea towards getting one of those cool zero-radius-turn mowers but it went for $4000.  There was a Ford 1910 (model #, not year) tractor that went for more than $7000.  I'm convinced that I should be going into the tractor restoration business.  There was even an old Farmall Cub tractor in really rough condition that ended up going for $1800. (The picture is a different tractor)  In contrast, the auction yesterday had a beautiful 1972 Lincoln Continental with 57,000 original miles that only ended up going for $3250.  When we went back to pick up the tractor, I found out that they pulled the car from the auction with the view that it was really worth more than that.  I agree with that but it means that the seller has to start over again and start marketing it.  I don't think he was totally happy about that but he didn't find out until the end of the auction.    I think that one of the reasons I like auctions so much, other than to find way cool deals, is to sort of get a piece of the history of other people.  I find myself wanting to be the caretaker of the things that people no longer want yet someone liked well enough to buy or make.  There are items that we think are ugly today yet were considered high-fashion in their time.  And we feel connections with the mundane.  The guy who owned this tractor hadn't used it regularly for several years, as he'd bought a newer and bigger one.  Yet, when it was wheeled out for the auction, his daughter was upset that he was getting rid of it, saying that she'd grown up with it.  As an aside (aren't all of my blog entries asides, really?), I was upset with my sister for giving away the old Allis Chalmers tractor that I grew up with.  It's the first thing I ever drove, the sound lulled me to sleep on many summer nights as my dad would mow into the darkness, it's a part of my childhood.  Never mind that it was ancient, it was ours.  It was mine.  There are little knicknacks that are parts of our lives which are part of the 'background noise'.  Things that are in our world for our entire lives and when they go away we feel their absence.  A particular piece of furniture; an old table lamp; even the way a room is arranged.  We get used to them and they become part of that noise.  When they change, so changes the noise.  It's different -- not quite right.  It's a little out of tune.  I guess that when I buy that little knicknack, I try to bring a sense of harmony into my own life and allow those who grow up with something and wonder what's happen to it to imagine that it's gone to a good home.",

        "blog_text": "Music has always come first in my life. I grew up playing music, I still play music, I'm always thinking music. As I've learned to hone my musical skills I've picked up some rules-- rules that musicians should follow to ensure their musicianship is at its highest quality: \n-If the line you are going to play can't be hummed by a listener, or get stuck in someone's head, it isn't worth playing. It is forced and insincere. \n-There's more than one way to say what you want, but there is always one BEST way. \n-Be concise. Only play/be concerned with what is necessary. Intricacies are meaningless and only impress the naîve. Dmdim^6sus9 does not matter. It is simply Dm. \n-Just as a bike, a bus, and a car are all different means of getting to a single destination, technique is just a means of saying what you want to say. It should not dictate the music that you play... You drive your car, the car does not drive you where it wants to go. You control your music, do not let the rules of your music control you. \n-There is no breaking tradition, there is only evolution. There was a point when tradition wasn't tradition. There are people who want to keep it bebop, but at one point bebop wasn't tradition. People like Dizz and Bird were really streatching it. \n-People ask 'How can I learn to improvise [better]?'-- They don't realize that they most likely improvised that question. They werent thinking nouns, pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions, etc. You say what you feel, but it's because your vocabulary is big enough that you have a lot to choose from, and you can actually make sense with what you say. Improv is about building a musical vocabulary so large, so well, that you con't have to think about what you're trying to say, you just say it. When you do think about it it's like walking; when you think about walking you trip. (I could go on and on with this) \nMusic is a language, as any other language. From being a musician, from following these rules, I am able to find my voice. I take this same approach to my other native language, English. When I write (and talk, in most cases) I try to use English the way I use music. I try to be musical. The most important thing is sincerity-- Am I saying what I truly feel? Am I saying what I truly mean?-- Without sincerity all other skill, all other conventions are useless. Speak from your heart and hit them in their soul. With music you can't just go back and unplay what you just played, nor should you if you could. It's about the moment, as cheesy as that sounds. It's about how you feel and what made you feel that way, right in the context of then and there. That is why 90% of all my first drafts end up being my final copies. I may go back and change words but I still try to keep the exact feeling I was shooting for in the first place. There is a place for eloquence and there is a place for absurdity. For instance: A jazz concert is no place for the sazophonist to get up and take a stand-up comedy solo. However, there are instances where what you say or write can and should be [terribly] out of place. Doing this can work to accentuate or reinforce what you are trying to say. It's like how many heavy metal bands incorporate acoustic guitars, and even orchestras, into their music. It makes for a more profound effect. Finally, and most importantly (to my style) is my use of grammar and punctuation. Almost always, I will say something a certain way (ie use a specific word, or use a certain conjunction) because I mean to do exactly that. You'll find lots of alliteration, repetition, and odd/unconventional comma use (among other punctuations) in my writing, and it's usually there because that's exactly how I want it. It makes things sound rhythmic and adds a tasteful melody. But, I never intend to sound lyrical, only musical-- melodic, rhythmic. I picked this up from jazz pianist/composer Dave Brubeck, who used words, names, and lines of speech to write melodies for his instrumental songs. Just like in music, every word has a timbre (colot), but that color can depend greatly on the words/notes preceeding it and following it. Each word has its own feel-- a staccato, a crescendo, a cascade-- it's all a matter of finding the right one for what you have to say and how you want your readers to feel.",

        "blog_text": "The following letter was read by the author at this year’s In Celebration of the Muse, Cabrillo College. An Open Letter to John Ashcroft, Attorney General of the United States. On January 28, 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft announced that he spent $8,000 of taxpayer’s money for drapes to cover up the exposed breast of The Spirit of Justice, an 18-foot aluminum statue of a woman that stands in the Department of Justice’s Hall of Justice. John, John, John, you’ve got your priorities all wrong. While men fly airplanes into skyscrapers, dive-bomb the Pentagon, while they stick explosives into their shoes and then book a seat right next to us, while they hide knives in their luggage, steal kids on school buses, take little girls from their beds at night, drive trucks into our state capital buildings, while our president calls dangerous men all over the world evildoers and devils, while we live in the threat of biological warfare, nuclear destruction, annihilation, you are out buying yardage to save Americans from the appalling, alarming, abominable aluminum alloy of evil, that terrible ten foot tin tittie. You might not be able to find Bin Laden, but you sure as hell found the hooter in the hall of justice. It’s not that we aren’t grateful. But while we were begging the women of Afghanistan to not cover up their faces, you are begging your staff members to just cover up that nipple to save the American people from that monstrous metal mammary. How can we ever thank you? So, in your office every morning, in your secret prayer meeting, while an American woman is sexually assaulted every 6 seconds, while anthrax floats around the post office and settles in the chest of senior citizens, you’ve got another chest on your mind. While American sons arrive home in body bags and heat-seeking missiles fly around a foreign country looking for any warm body, you think of another body. And you pray for the biggest bra in the world, John, because you see that breast on the Spirit of Justice in the spirit of your own inhibited sexuality. And when we women see our grandmothers, our mothers, our daughters, our granddaughters, our sisters, ourselves, when we women see that statue the Spirit of Justice, we see the spirit of strength, the spirit of survival. While every day we view innocent bodies dragged out of rubble and women and children laid out like thin, limp dolls and baptized into death as collateral damage, and the hollow-eyed Afghani mother’s milk has dried up underneath her burka in famine, in shame, and her children are dead at her breast. While you look at that breast, John, that jug on the Spirit of Justice, and deal with your thoughts of lust and sex and nakedness, we see it as a testimony to motherhood. And you see it as a tit. It’s not the money it cost. It’s the message you send. We’ve got the right to live in freedom. We’ve got the right to cheat Americans out of millions of dollars and then just not want to tell Congress about it. We’ve got the right to drop bombs night and day on a small country that has no army, no navy, no military at all, because we’ve got the right to bear arms, but we just better not even think about the right to bare breasts. So now, John, you can be photographed while you stand there and talk about guns and bombs and poisons, without the breast appearing over your right shoulder, without that bodacious bosom bothering you, and we just wanted to tell you, in the spirit of justice, in the spirit of truth, John, there is still one very big boob left standing there in that picture. -- Claire Braz-Valentine",

        "blog_text": "Tonight I was planning to send out a large email to my friends and family.  My email program was set to add people to my address book automatically, so it was full of email addresses that I didn't expect to be using.  Online shopping stores, marketing email accounts, subscriptions for which I didn't sign up.  I had known about the problem for a while, but because I usually respond directly to emails I have received, I didn't worry about it.  Tonight, however, I decided it would be a good time to clean the flotsam from my address book. I wasn't prepared for what I would find.   I started at the top of the list, checking the names and deleting the entries I knew were duplicates or old email addresses, along with the entries that I didn't recognize.  Not quite halfway through the list, I was stopped by an entry that I didn't know how to deal with.   The entry was the name of my friend and high school computer teacher, Paul Soik.  The email address was valid.  The person was a friend.  Initially I decided to leave it, move on to the next one. But then I stopped.   Paul had passed away over a month ago.   For only the second time in my life, I have discarded the contact information of a friend who has died. It's a disheartening feeling.  I know I'll never have need of this information again but I still feel guilty, as if I've thrown away the friendship and memories along with the phone number and address.  Even though he is gone, I still think of Paul as a friend.  Why am I throwing away a friend's number?   A part of me is glad that I feel guilty.  I hope I never get used to removing friends from my address book. I hope I never have to remove the number of someone who is still here.   Twice recently I've had conversations with people who act as if friendships and personal relationships require constant maintenance or should be discarded.  'If they don't talk to me why should I talk to them?'  Is that really how it is?  Do people really stop enjoying someone's personality, their company and companionship, if that person isn't giving some predetermined amount of attention?  I don't understand that attitude at all.   There are people that I haven't seen or spoken to in years who I still count among my friends, and I would hope that they count me among theirs.  In fact, only two days ago I received a phone call from a friend that I haven't seen or spoken to in over a year.  Between us, It was almost as if no time had passed at all.  We had a lot to talk about of course — a lot had changed in our lives — but we knew that our friendship was still the same. It's comforting to have a relationship with that kind of timeless consistency, consistency that isn't a product of diligence or perseverance but of choice.  We choose to stay friends.   I'd like to think that I could call any of my old friends and they would be happy to hear from me, regardless of how long it has been.  I'd like to think that old friends still think of me fondly from time to time.  I'd like to think that the people I've met in my life will grieve a little bit when they remove me from their address book; not because I'm no longer a friend, but because I'm no longer here to talk.   Rest in Peace, Paul.  You've still got friends here.",

I carry the memories and friendship in my heart, but performing this act underscores his absence in a very real way. I grieve as I do it, but I don’t want to become numb to these losses; my friendships matter deeply to me, regardless of constant contact. This pain means I still value those connections, and I never want to stop cherishing my friends—even those who are gone.",

        "blog_text": "It is the most beautiful and wonderful thing, but there is a dark side, a side we do not see. The side of when the love is gone, the absence of it and the fear you have that one day you will have to endure that absence. I fear I will not be strong enough. I sit and realize that 18 hrs away is driving me mad as I sit here alone watching tv, playing games, reading, making jewelry, eating, pacing, anything to keep me busy. It is funny that in me a know that I don't NEED Nathan to the point that it is a bad thing but I also know the luxury of seeing the world in color, instead of black and white and now when I go back to the mediocre past in which I once inhabited I am falling apart. I sit alone here, I can't turn to Jessica who is in Connecticut with Justin, I cannot turn to my parents who are in Arizona or my sister who is with them, not even my other sister who is with her love in Ohio. The world is suddenly empty and my house so large and spacious. Of course the dogs keep me company but it isn't the same. I guess I should go out to stay busy and go shopping or go just join the world but the world is a scary place and instead I sit here in hopes that the phone will ring and Nathan will be on the other line telling me he thinks of me. I know he thinks of me all the time but I never tire of hearing about it. I should be being productive and cleaning or sorting or something but instead I sit in constant despair until my other half has returned. I need to sign up for some art classes or make more friends to fill the time. It is funny I am so alone now and bored but in just 2 days my family will return and I will be full of not a lonely but a chaotic pain. I will suffer the intolerable cruelty of listening to my family quarrel and my sister will be sad at some point and though I try to console her as does my mother then there is my father who just breaks down sometimes and gets so frustrated that I am reminded of crying in my room when I was 6 years as I heard my mother cry and I wished I could do something. Nathan is my prince charming and has come to save me, but this isn't a fairy tale and though I can pray that the ending will be happy I will still have this pain. Then there is my mother who has no one to turn to. She was so stressed this May her blood pressure got to 210 over something and I had to take her to the hospital. I worry, she watched her father die from a heart attack there, and I don't want to see her suffer, she needs a shoulder to cry on, but so do I. No wonder I go to therapy once a week, but anyone who goes knows that it never seems to be at the time you need it, for some reason the moments that you encounter your psychiatrist/psychologist is one of the moments in the week that you are ok. And so now I cry as I set down the phone, I hoped it was Nate but instead it's the Democratic party calling for donations. Can someone tell me why life is the way it is, I wish everyone could just give and be kind but instead we have hate and pain and sorrow, and it eats me up inside. But yet I hate to sit here and cry because then I am hurting the one person who brightens every moment without effort and I hurt my Nathan, for when I cry he feels my pain and then that hurts him and it hurts me more, but I hold back my tears and smile to know that he is happy so once again am I. For if I dwell in sorrow I bring him it would only bring him more sorrow and thus continue this painful circle. I will see him in 2 hours most likely but it is never enough, I feel so greedy, and needy but I guess that is who I am, I just hope it is good enough, not for the world but for Nathan. It is hard, no matter how much I heal and continue I hold these scars in my soul and will carry them, because in reality dropping all of my baggage and sorrow would mean starting again and that is even scarier, because even though it may be less painful somehow this painful world is comforting because it is what I have always known. Yet I love it when it is gone when I am in Nathan's arms and there are no troubles, the weight is gone, and for those moments I am truly happy, I guess I am just terrified of the thought that this feeling that I realize is more than any other I have ever felt could one day end and that is terrifying. It is scary to admit it but when I look back on everyone I have ever been with thought I loved or even perhaps did love, it was nothing like this, not even if I took what I had to them and put it to the 100th power would it compare to this to the way it feels when my lips touch Nathan and I feel him quiver in my arms and I know for that moment why we are here, why the world is so hard, because in fact this love is here. So if by chance it is all gone when I woke up tomorrow, this month and a half with Nathan in my life would have made years of suffering worthwhile but I don't want to go back ever, not now that I am here. Why would someone leave heaven to endure hell, that's the way it feels, I would never give this up, I would sooner throw all my possessions out the window and run away from it all then give up this feeling give up this love this passion that has taken me over. I sit here and type, I tell myself to stop but I can't express it not in a million words. I want to come on and just say what I've been up to but am overwhelmed with this feeling to share with the world the hope that exists that is there. So for those of you who have endured and read my long and senseless ranting take with you these words of advice, whatever pain you have undergone and continue to undergo there is hope there is love, when there is war and hate and murder there is love and hope so never give up, dream and enjoy every second because on one day you will look back and those little moments like singing along in the car and feeling awkward because you know your voice cracks and the person next to you can't take it, remember those moments are the moments we live for, those are the true moments that we truly LIVE.",

        "blog_text": "bakground:  my dad, who will henceforth be known as padre, has been bowling for many years.  he taught me how to roll, he taught my brother, my sisters, small villages ... basically any creature with an opposable thumb and an ear has learned something about bowling from padre.  unfortunately, he has never thrown a 300.  nor, to my surprise, has he ever won a league.  me and league titles go together like spic and span, but never for padre.  going into tonight, we were 1 game ahead of second place and in control of our own fate.  we had just played this team 2 weeks ago and taken 4 of 4 from them.  we decimated them.  they had every reason to want to permanently damage both our families and friends. additional bakground:  padre had been having what he might consider an 'average year'.  padre's average this year is a 208.  only to padre would this be an average year.  he had been showing signs of breaking out a few weeks before, but then just last week his neck was bothering him, and he just wasn't himself.  it was tough to watch padre not be his superhuman self, but i learned that that was all part of the show.  when padre absolutely unearthed all 10 in the first frame tonight, you could tell something was up.  i then proceeded to watch what could only be described as a herculean display of 10 pin annihilation.  ball after ball eviscerated the pocket leaving nothing behind.  there were no lucky breaks, no cheap ones, no jersey, nothing.  every time i saw his ball zip toward the pocket i had to protect my eyes to make sure that no pin shrapnel jettisoned into them.  pins on other lanes started falling, and to top it off, another local bowling alley had to cancel its league night due to unexplained pinfall.  what was i to do but try to keep up with him?  i was only playing john henry to his steel driving machine, only in this version the steel driving machine wins, and then turns john henry into a railroad tie.  padre threw the first 9 strikes in the first game, then decided that bowling was a trivial sport and went 9 spare, strike, for a 279.  i could only stand by and watch and strike.  i rolled the first 9 as well, but finished short with a 278.  our team won by about 50.  after an effort like that, you always joke and say, 'guess you'll have to get them all next game.'  then padre, the smoothest motherfu**ker in the whole joint, went out and tried to do just that.  i tried reasoning with him.  i tried showing him pictures of the families of the pins that he was mercilessly slaughtering, but there was no reaching him.  he continued to plunder the pocket to the tune of 10 strikes in a row, finishing with a 289.  i wasn't even close, posting only a 245.  at this point, we had completely wrapped up the second half championship.  we won the second game by 200 pins.  when dad and i talked about this week following the previous week of bowling we both said something like, 'we're going to have to bring it all next week.'  then padre did.  no, f that, not only did he bring it all, he asked for everyone else's and brought that.  then he just mashed the pins for about 2 and a half hours.  at the end of the night, some sort of kryptonic force caught up to him and held him to a 203, thus capping his night at 771.  i was in awe.  i have never seen anyone so locked in.  i'm pretty sure i've been that locked in, but when you're doing it, you can't see it happening.  it just is.  i rolled a 769, and while the scores may look close, it really wasn't.  the last game didn't count for anything, except a potential 800 series, so padre i think finally showed some mercy.  padre will tell people that i'm better, and if you add and divide, that may be true.  but in the clutchest week of the entire year, to come out and throw 19 of 24 possible strikes, i'd have to say that's pretty f'ing good.  damn padre.  damn",

'  and what would i say when i came face to face with my Lord on that day?  what would i say to the one who bore the sins of the world?  '  im sorry, Lord.  you died for ME.  you gave ME salvation.  you gave ME hope.  yet i was too blind to see.  i just couldnt live with the pain of life.  i couldnt handle it.  though you bore the pain of the world on that cross.  i couldnt bear the pain of one single lifetime.  this is how i repay you, Lord.  this is the fruit of your sacrafice.  me.  the weak pathetic soul that gave up.  '  how could i do it?  how could i spit in the face of the Christ by giving up the gift he gave to me?  my guilt saved me that night.  and i now live each day with a different view of life.  i am not afraid to die.  nor am i afraid to live.  i am thankful for what God let me see.  i am thankful for the experience of near suicide.  it has made me stronger and wiser.  but i still feel the guilt of what i nearly did.  i live everday with the shame.  i feel so terrible that i live while other good people die and suffer.  people who never would have through Gods gift away.  why cant it be me?  why cant i suffer for them?  i was the one who threw away His gift.  they dont deserve the pain.  i have known for so long now that i would die for anyone.  to save one life... i know i could give mine.  i feel so humbled in the presence of my friends from church.  because i know that most of them would never dream of throwing away their gift.  i feel so ashamed to call myself one of their friends... and i have never told anyone.  ever since that night... i have felt so unworthy of the second chance i have gotten.  i am blessed.  because i now can see both sides of life.  ive seen the joy of life and the emptiness of life.  and i can now help.  and thats what i intend to do.  i want to spend the rest of my life helping those who have no hope.  i want to give them a reason to live.  that is my goal in life.  if i can help just one person... then this second chance God has given me was not in vain.  all that i have just told you is my darkest confession of what i almost did.  it is what haunts me everyday.  deep inside... in the back of my mind i know its there.  this that i have shared is  my requiem",

        "blog_text": "It's something unpredictably,  But in the end, it's right.  I hope you had the time of your life.' -Green Day, 'Good Riddance'   there are some things you have to know about the DC trip.   40 eight graders take a trip to DC and NY at the price of $1600 and some other expenses for souvenirs.    Day 1     at 4:15 i called janis and told her we were coming to pick her up. the car ride was icy cold. i could feel my stomach twist. my skin hummed with eagerness. we met at the airport around 5:30 at the United terminal, San Jose.   my stomach still feels knarly and i take some pepto bismol. anyway, we check in. my partner is teena davis. i’ve known her since like.. 1st grade..? prolly. she’s really cool and i couldn’t have asked for a better buddy. we check our bags and Mrs. Chavez gives us our boarding passes so we head to the gate. teena got stopped in security cause she had 40 hair pins in from grad. night. good times, good times.   we were all sitting around in the gate.  maya brodkey, ryan juntado, sarah rorvick, lisa vechionne, amanda yabarra, des cook, cerena barros, tessa libby, kate kahoano, kevin grassadonia, delia guerrero, nathalie servin, kevin deming, miguel dolores, teena davis, des cuneo, lizette lopez, jessica llanos, angelica solis, neil osterman, stephen mccon, elena rossman, miki burns, augustine perez, aaron melim, janis dinkins, lexi tenney, aly rumpanos, matt starkey, isais dolores, ashlee dominguez, kassie dogherra, ben fisher, jaime sanchez, ashley sanders, scott glass, dan.. um.. something, maddie flood, valerie getts, roxy rafi-tarie, elena jin and michele chelman.   anyway, we’re all sitting waiting for jocelyn zimniki to arrive at the airport.  now dont get me wrong, jocelyn’s one of the coolest people i noe, but at this point we are all a little angry at her.   she shows up and check’s in and before you noe it we’re on the plane, sweeping off the ground. daredevil played on screen and some of the kids (mikaela) watched it in espanol. ha ha. we ate fruit, took pics and when they turned the fasten seat belt sign off we got up and PARTIED! seriously, the walkways were crowded with kids.   it was crazy! we swapped CDs, played cards, read magazines, desiree cuneo (who i sat next to) even broke her chair.. you noe, the normal stuff. (i was also sitting next to teena.)   when the movie ended a blooper/comedy show came on and then NBC was up after that. lexi sat behind me and we were listening to the grease soundtrack, cause she played Cha-Cha in a play. “it’s raining on prom niight!” i brought that CD just for her.   uh oh! we hit turbulence half way into the flight. the second time we all were rushed to our seats. teena ended up with Maya and Matt behind me, and Maddie was next to me. Des still stayed by the window.   we still swapped CDs, and my graduation mix made elena and mikaela cry. aww. i was having tons of fun and we werent even in DC yet! des shuffled cards while maddie fiddled with the air vents.   the stewardess came around with soda. one ginger ale please. maddie and i took turns throwing pretzels at each other :-D.   the captian turned the sign off and we all moved around. Matt ended up sitting next to me. Des was figuring out her new digital camera, and matt played his gameboy.   we’ve landed at our gate, D16, in the Dulles airport. just imagine, 5 hours ago we left gate C2 at San Jose. I wonder if anyone got there bag sent to Cuba.. ha ha.matt and i had the same time on our watches.. and miki said something about making out with her cheek..? oo yeah, those blanket that had been touched by naked bodies!   we got our bags and yummy candy and then we stepped out into the humidity of the East Coast. it was a relief when our AC’d bus drove up.   We drove passed some famous sites, the Potomac, the Washington Monument, Smithsonian, White House, Federal Reserve and the Department of the Interior (don’t ask...)   There was a parade in front of the White House. lots of military vehicles and what not.  we passed more sites, a car being towed, a bus of old people, American History Musuem, the National Achives and the IRS!!   Starkey made a funny quote “Some people are smart, some people are not…”   our chaperones for the trip were Mrs. Chavez, her son and daughter: Mike and... um... the daughter. and also our librarian, Gayle Rorvick! She’s really cool.   we drove into Union Station and peered at the top of the building. Fire, Electricity, Freedom, Knowlegde, Agriculture and Mechcanics. all things that helped man evolve from the primitive beast he once was.   we j-walked to the train station, where we found a REALLY COOL food court. we bought pizza and talked about how Nathalie got hit on!! by an old guy!! that’s when i first met nathalie. well.. not first met, but first had a real conversation with.  Nathalie and and I got gelato ice cream. mm. and then i bought a pint of lemon ice cream for our room. Ahh! Mrs. Chavez said it would melt before we got back. we had to eat it super duper fast. I ate with Matt, Kassie, Nathalie, Janis, Teena and Aaron, but left to go shopping with Jessica and Amanda. I took the ice cream with me :-D.   We looked at books and finished the ice cream. we even saw a really cool train! we met up with Aaron, Matt, Kassie and Teena on the way out. Jessie said she’d she me on the bus and Matt was like “or in hell!” Then Kassie and I walked back to the bus taking pictures along the way.   on the bus we sang “Baby Got Back” and then our tour with Hopi got under way. We drove to the Jefferson Memorial and i got some cute pics of Miki, Elena, Elena and Lexi. there was a really big ledge too.. Jocelyn almost walked off it.   then we headed to the to the Roosevelt Memorial. Hopi (our tour guide) asked “do we need a bathroom break?”, Jaime yelled “NO! We got cups!” and then Miki was like “Not all of us are like Kevin..”   the FDR memorial was really cool. there were a bunch of waterfalls and we got a bunch of photos. it was really hot tho.. if i stayed outside any longer i would’ve friend like bacon. Matt said the Washington Monument looked possesed.. and then he said sweat was good hair gel. lol.   i’ve known matt since preschool.. more or less. he was friends with my cousin Kalie. his mom knew her grandma or something... yeah.. anyway, he was prolly my first best friend.   anyway, there was a bunch of rain and lightning. rorvick and i were gettin’ pretty freaked out.. Matt said a bunch of things “Guys take showers so they don’t smell worse,” and “Maybe we could hit the guy who didnt make a california avenue.”   we went to a supermarket to buy stuff for our room. in line, Matt, Aaron and I stood behind a drunk guy in a dress! he was buyin’ Burban! lol. then we got back on the bus and it started to pour like never before.   when we got to the hotel, Karen checked us in and we went to our lucky room. 509!! Mike came by and gave matt his medicine, and then we got ice to chill our drinks.   Kassie and Teena and Ashlee came up to see us when this creepy old man came over and said “I will not tolerate loudness, I have two 8 year olds in a bed and I will not have you waking them out. One loud noise and *snap* I’ll call the front desk and you’re outta here.”   we spent the rest of the night talking to everyone on the phone.   some hot gossip?   Tessa, Kate and Cerena got a security gaurd assigned right outside their door.  Des Cuneo, Nathalie and their room buddie have a fridge! They said we could store stuff in it...  Kassie, Teena and Ashlee got their phones disconnected!   kassie came up to get ice and i saw tape on our door and thought mike had sealed it, but he didnt and anyway, teena sealed it and we got ready for bed. Mike came to tuck us in and that’s when we found out he hadn’t put the tape on! he talked to us about tomorrow and about our “traumatizing” run-in with the old red neck.   everyone went to bed and i stayed up, in the bathtub, writing in my journal.    Day 2    we ended up talking until 2 the night before. the red neck was banging against our wall, but we weren’t being loud.. lol.. in the morning we woke up, showered, and went down to breakfast. I had eggs and cereal.   then we walked to the lobby and found a handicapped bathroom! it was so cool! it opened by itself!! and then we rode the escalators. then on bus, we heard about how elena rossman ran into her closet mirror because she thought it was open.   elena is awesome! i’ve known her since 5th grade... maybe longer.. yeah , i think longer. but anyway, shes really nice and fun and friendly. one time i threw a phone book at her and it hit hurt in the head. i bought her candy though! lol..   we headed to the Veitnam Memorial and we all got carnations to put out for soilders. our first stop was the Korean War memorial. 19 soilders lined up on the tundra. next we visted the Veitname Memorial, with 58,226 names cast in stone, the place felt lonely. empty. names. all names.   i left a carnation under Micheal A. Walter’s grave thinking he might be related to Cooper... that kid is so perverted.   anyway, we walked to the Einstein statue and took pictures. there was a rumor that if you touch his nose, you will get smarter. i touced it... twice... just in case. we got back on the bus. woo, that AC relieved me. oh yeah.. miki is goldylocks.. and janis is a hyena? i dunno, those two are crazy. Hopi had a bunch of sweat stains on her butt... lol..   George Pataki and Chris Cox. New York Senator and California Representative. I met them both! We got out of the bus and headed to the front of the Supreme Court building. thats the judical branch. these hairy guys came up to us.. i think they were making fun of people who wore fur cause they were dressed like cave men.   anyway, we took pictures and i told tessa that her family had come to resuce her from civilization. “Smile and say FAMILY REUNION!” yeah.. you had to be there...   then we went to the Library of Congress. there was a naked statue of Neptune in the front. with a 9 incher! Inside the library we saw a bunch of books and there was a really cool zodiac floor! Nathalie and I love it! There was even the first book ever printed!   we walked to the capitol building and I met Chris Cox from New Port Beach! He shook my hand! It made my day. we went in the building and we saw TONS of priceless artwork. it was amazing. De Soto, Columbus, The Pilgrims, Pocahontas, The Declaration, Saratoga and Yorktown were some of the paintings.   we also saw a bunch of statues and learned a lot about the capitol. then we met george pataki. on the capitol building lawn, there was a protest. “Circumcision is wrong! The foreskin is not a birth defect!” boy, that prolly made the jewish boys behind us very happy. oo! alec is jewish!   yeah, back to story. oh we went to McDonalds next and we have to eat EVERYTHING we bought. I ended up eating everything everyone else didnt want too.. Fries, Milkshakes, McNuggest (Nathalie calls them “Muggets”) and more fries. i left them a souvenior the janitor will never forget. Kassie said “we should take a picture of the fries!” and kate was like “just look in the toilet tomorrow!”   Next we stopped at the White House visitor center. I picked p some stuff for Mr. Sullivan AND! i got a coloring book! yay! we walked back to the bus and stopped at the White House. I got a stick from the lawn! it was really cool. and i saw the West Wing! That is a really good show...! there were a lot of squrriels too.. we walked past Alexander Hamilton and the Treasury Building and we even saw a monument to General Sherman! it reminded me of Gone with the Wind.   we then went to the Holocaust Museum and watched a story about a boy named Daniel. it was really sad. there was even a little walk through thing and Lisa V. was my partner. Lisa is really cool.. and really nice too.   then we went to the old post office and went up a glass elavator. it was ok, the veiw was kinda weird, but hey, i had Kevin grassadonia’s booty scrunched close to me for most of it, so it was great. coming down the elevator, teena scared me to death. we left the old post office and headed to..   THE INTERNATIONAL SPY MUSEUM! way lamer than it sounds... i got a cool shirt tho. and i beat kevin g. a lot though at this weird game. ha ha i won. we got to climb through an air duct too! it got really boring.. but then there was this thing where you could see ur house on a satelitte! it was awesome! i bought a sweet t-shirt that says “Deny Everything” yay!   it started to rain and we got back on the bus. soon we stopped at a pizza place. matt got cheese poured in his hair and i made kassie laugh by saying “Cheese Me” when the waiter came around. Well we headed to the Lincoln memorial after that. we took a bunch of pictures and learned a lot about old Abe. He was really tall...   we went shopping at this little place with a bunch of street vendors and the rain began to pour. we got back on the bus and headed to the Kennedy Center for Fine Arts. there were flags from every nation except Lybia, Iran, Iraq, Cuba and North Korea. we also got to see into an opera and we saw a hall of states. then we went up a balcony and took pic.   Next, we drove to the Iwo Jima memorial, where Janis and I were the tour guides. fun stuff. we took a bunch of pictures of the six soilders raising the flag and then we just wanted to go home and sleep.   when we got to the hotel, Janis and I used the phones to try and call Ellen. it as busy, but we met these 2 girls and janis gave them her room number. When i got to my room, the door was open and Aaron and Matt were gone, probably getting ice. Lexi and Elena called and told us to go downstairs to a party.   we brought candy and soda and MM they had cheez-its. we also got to raid Mrs. Chavez’s room and get free food. then we went back to our rooms and tried to get to sleep. but instead we ended up talking until three. we were really tired in the morning.    Day 3    FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH!!   today was the trip to Arlington national cemetery. after a quick breakfast we were taken into a world of sad sculptures and gravestones. we visited the eternal flame and the tomb of the unknown solider. the hike was a long one, but the changing of the guards was.. for the most part... worth it. it was kinda dramatic.. but it’s to honor the dead so i guess its ok. i liked it.   all in all arlington was good. after the cemetary, we headed for the washington monument. we rode the elevator to the top. well, the 100 floor. the look down was 500 feet! it was really cool, we got to see so much! after the monument we walked to the Smithsonian where we said “Aloha” to our tour guide.   we got to travel around the “Mall” which is the term used for the block on which the Smithsonian museums sit. We breaked and picked buddies. Ashlee and I headed for the Natural history museum and headed all the way down to the food court. we got soo much food!   i’ve known ashlee since kindergarten..? yeah, she’s really cool and funny. and she likes to read a lot, so if i ever read a book then her and i can have discussions about it.. its funner than you think :-D   anyway, after we looked at a bunch of gems and the Hope Diamond. 52.27 karat from India. there were a lot of crystals and stuff and i got a sweatshirt from the american history museum. we went across the street and walked down to the art museum. we bought a few bottles of soda. we took pictures in front of a fountain and then went into the air and space museum. thats where we met up with Janis, Nat, Valerie, Ashley and Lisa.  Nathalie and I ditched Janis and Ashlee and hid behind a fence thing that we thought was tinted (we can see out but they cant see in) Janis and Ashlee were walking aroundon the floor below. suddenly they look up at us and wave. Nathalie screams “I THOUGHT THEY COULDN’T SEE IN!”   we continued walking and we got in a WW2 plane! how fuun!! we checked out some rooms with planets in them and we looked at some space shuttles too.   at five we met matt, ben, aaron, janis, ashlee and everyone else in front of the museum. it was scorching hot but the bus came soon and we drove to the Department of Printing and Engraving. we saw moola being made and we checked out the gift shop.  on the ceiling there were motion censors, and my head almost set them off.   after the money place we drove outta DC. we drove to virgina and stopped at the pentagon mall where we went shopping! ee! ashley sarah and I went to abercrombie and then viki’s. it was so much fun! they had really cute undies in fcuk. then we went back to the bus, running through the rain to get to it.   back at the hotel, we all got dressed in our bathing suits and went down to the pool. i sat outside and wrote in my notebook since the rain had died down. i walked with elena back to the lobby but i realized i had forgotten my key. we went to the front desk to ask for another one, but they wouldnt make one for me.   teena walked me back to the pool and we got aarons key. i went into the elevator and teena said “be right back.” so i held the elevator and this guy came in and was like “going up?” and i was all “yep..” and then a while later he got out and teena came back and got in and he was like “going up?” and she was like “sorry.” by the time i got back to the 4th floor, elena was done showering and we all hung out. it was another hall party! i went in kevin’s room and we talked and yeah, it was fun.   i ran back up to my room and slipped a note under the door for aaron and matt. i also brought candy downstairs. the hall party was gettin’ hot and i ran back to my room to get soda right when matt and aaron got back. matt and aaron went down to the party but at 10 we had to get back to our rooms and tuck in.

Lost in the University of Nowhere in Wherethehellami, OH. Computer science major, psychology minor. Six feet tall. Afro. Navy-blue colored contacts. TMK-esque fashion (black denim, turtlenecks, t-shirts, all-around corporate billboard, RCR/Cingular hat from early 2004). All nice, but where is TMK now?  It's noon, and TMK's at  Joey's  drinking a Budweiser. The bar is empty, unless you count the forlorn near-dropout chick (from his Psych Hist 313) sitting at the opposite end of the bar flipping through her wavy black hair.  TMK sits there, staring off into space. He wonders what became of his apprenticeship; the memories are blurred, too much alcohol and wine.  He thinks of his lost friends, all of them. His first thoughts are of Sathya. Not much had changed between them, really, in the last ten years, probably after the Sanity Incident in mid-2003, which effectively stopped things. He hasn't heard a word from her in the last three years, and the last he ever did hear of her was something jumbled, but involving some guy named Phillip in one way or another. The thoughts drift to Kalin. He's still in-state, working for the AJC. Every once in a while his articles appear in the paper, and when they do TMK usually makes sure to drop some congrats. At last recollection, Kalin had a fiancee, but her name resides in the cloudy memory.  So it seems...all of his friends had already found someone...except him. It had been more than three years since his last normal friendship with a female, over ten years since anyone resembling a loving friend, and almost twenty since his only 'girlfriend.' His confidence resides at zero, his looks resemble a dead man living, and his personality resembles a robotic jackass far more than it does a human.  His career...he pauses and takes another swig.   I don't have a career!  he thought to himself.  I'm just another goddamned 25-year old burnout with loaded .22!   The bartender returns, walks up to TMK, and hands him a lengthy slip of paper. The bill. TMK pores over it, and rolls his eyes.  'You're paying me for this amount, right?' TMK says drunkenly. The bartender nods sarcastically, laughing as he retreats to his office. TMK, infuriated by the response, smacks away the beer bottle, leaving a loud BANG and a million shards of glass on the floor. The chick looks up, twirling her hair, and stares at TMK.  He stares back. Not something he's used to doing. They eye each other uneasily for several seconds, and then the girl stands and saunters over to TMK.  TMK examines her figure.  (riminy, is she pretty,  TMK thought as he peered down at her thin 5'7 frame.  'You lookin' for a fight, stranger?' She opens in a soft, yet powerful voice.  'N-n-no, don't believe so,' TMK responds uneasily. The girl moves closer to him, and gazes into his eyes, causing him to step backward.  Well...I'm bored. I don't want to continue, but portraying myself nine years in the future is pretty fun. Who knows...perhaps if I survive the next eleven I'll be able to compare with this thing.",

        "blog_text": "While many Indian authors (who most of them have settled abroad anyway), have written about displaced Indians (example – Rushdie) and weaved fantasy stories around them, there are others who have preferred be an on looker and write stories set in India (example – Mistry). These writers have similar qualities in their characters trying to find their lost souls back in motherland or stories of pathos in the country. However when an author comes along and decides to take a view of an Immigrant life it becomes interesting. It becomes even more interesting when the view is not presented as soul searching drama or triumph of human spirit, but just a book about normal characters, leading their lives normally.  Enter the  Gangulis .  Ashoke Ganguli  is one amongst those who like so many before him enters the American soil to fulfill his dream of leading his life there, beginning as a student at MIT. While as a student, he is also married to  Ashima Ganguli  who finds it difficult to accept her new home. Enter  Gogol Ganguli  a few years ahead, a misplaced namesake to their first son whom they cannot name properly because of a mail lost between the two countries, and who by the time they decide a proper name ‘Nikhil’ seems to have lost himself in the namesake. Enter  Sonali  a.k.a Sonia, Gogol’s sister, and the circle of family is completed. The ‘Namesake’ is their journey as Immigrants trying to find their real identity behind their namesake of being in America, and later holding American citizenship. And while it is the former, it is also about  Nikhil  trying to find a sense in his namesake.   A typical immigrant’s life begins with student life in America; after studies they germinate to good jobs, good cars and so forth. A marriage later and a green card in kitty, its time to start a family; a family being, it’s a struggle trying to bind the personal history to the kids who become more American  - and thus end up being called ABCDs – people displaced and trying to find their acceptance in the foreign land, while still not ready to let go off their roots. Years later, the parents have let go of their children, lost in their own identity crisis of having embraced a foreign land, without letting the roots of homeland go. The next generation, quite nicely becomes jelled and thus one more family is absorbed into the foreign land; but it’s the first and second generation that find it the toughest.    Lahiri  doesn’t boast of telling an awfully touching story or a dramatic novella, but rather weaves a very realistic story of a displaced family. Her characters are immediately believable, and one can relate to such every day characters. All characters, their behavior, their living style make up for a very believable story;  Lahiri  infuses minimum fuss and melodrama in the proceedings. Events in book are given their due respects, and situations and confrontations presented in the book are much authentic – the coming back to India for holidays, Durga Puja and Christmas, children’s non-interest in understanding their roots,  real events make for a riveting story.  However it is not the story per se that holds the reader’s interest. It is in  Lahiri’s  observations of nuances in life that makes the book immensely likeable. She is able to bring out the differences of American and Indian life from an immigrant’s point of view without too many words. Sometimes, it just takes a sentence or two for her to convey her thoughts on conflicting life and ideals. Simple observations like how most first generation Indians don’t quite have any American friends to call their own and close strikes a chord somewhere, even me, because it’s a simple truth. Observations like these are a plenty in the book, and make this a memorable read.    However saying that,  ‘The Namesake’  is a difficult book to relate to. While most of western audience cannot glimpse the nuances of her observations, I would be very surprised if Indian audiences would find her observations real and so true. ‘The Namesake’ treads a middle path, relating to Immigrants, and perhaps lies in a land it belongs nowhere to. Unless you are an immigrant and have seen the other part of Immigrant life, its pretty difficult to relate to the book. Those who are can and will very well relate to the book. Saying that it should not hinder either western or Indian audience to read this book – for it shows how the namesake of American life perpetually confounds the Immigrants.     Overall  An Excellent debut novel (her first was a collection of stories) – A must read for everyone, especially the Immigrants.",

Fynn, Mister God said 'I am', and that's what He wants us all to say - that's the hard bit. 'I am' ....that's the hard bit. 'I am'. Really get around to saying that and you're home, really mean it and you're full up, you're all inside. You don't have to want things outside you to fill up the gaps inside you. You don't leave bits of you hanging around on objects in shop-windows, in catalogues or on advertisement hoardings. Wherever you go you take your whole self with you, you don't leave bits lying around to get stamped on, you're all of a piece, you're what Mister God wants you to be. An 'I am', like He is. Hell's bells! All this time I had thought that going to church was in order to look for God, for praising Him. It didn't dawn upon me what Mister God was doing. All this time He had been working overtime trying to knock a bit of sense into my noddle, trying to turn an 'It is' into an 'I am'. I got the message. I was beginning to get the hang of this 'I am' stuff. Considering how important it was to Mister God, I was finding it not too impossible to cope with. The tricky bit was looking inside yourself to see what bits of the works were missing. Once you'd overcome that hurdle the rest was fairly simple. My first real peek inside myself caused me to slam the door in a hurry. 'That's me in there!' Holy cow, I looked more like an overgrown Gruyere cheese, full of holes. After getting over the shock, I opened the door a crack and took another peek. It wasn't long before I was able to identify one of the holes. It was shaped like a motor-bike. What's more, I recognised that hole. It was an exact fit of the motor-bike in the shop-window down the High Street. After some practice it became more and more easy to identify the holes...Somewhere down the line it had all gone wrong. I was certain that I hadn't started out with these holes. It was those damned banners that kept on cropping up: 'Get on', 'Get ahead'. 'A motorbike makes you someone', 'A car is even better', 'Two cars, and brother, you've hit the jackpot.' I had fallen for it, hook, line and sinker. The banners were inside of me and they were rooted in pretty fertile soil. The more banners were inside me, the more bits of me were outside me. 'Most of a person is outside'. You can say that again. Like a child learning a new word, I found myself struggling with 'I want to be me', 'I do want, I really do want to be ME'.

But my real fears, my real stresses and worries, my real beefs - those I keep mostly to myself, possibly a select few, or most often, to one person. I know it's unfair for me to do this. It's unfair for me to not confide in friends when they trust me so much to confide in me. It's unfair for me to burden one person with all of my mind dumps. And it's unhealthy for me to keep things inside.  I suppose I just don't want to seem weak to other people. By voicing my concerns, I feel that those concerns become more real. If I keep them in my head, maybe they'll go away or I'll figure out a way to deal with them. This doesn't always happen though. Instead, I'm left feeling anxious and unsettled.   I even have a hard time letting others know my goals, my hopes and my dreams. It's not that I think people will say, 'That's not possible'. It's that I, myself, think that I may not make those hopes and dreams a reality, that I'll fail. It's the thought that I might not be able to fulfill the goals I've set for myself, that I'll fall flat on my face, that prevents me from telling others, and maybe even from putting my whole heart into what I really want.   This isn't even what I intended to blog about in the first place, but I guess you can't really control this sort of thing. Maybe I needed to get this out there so that I can organize my other thoughts and finally get them out there, out here.  Be ready for a possible flood.",

No matter what they may seem though I still want them, badly. I long for the changes that I know will come with losing weight, things that some people take for granted. Sometimes it would be nice to live a 'normal' life. I want to do the things that so many take for granted like walking up stairs and breathing normally. I want to fit into any chair I sit in and not have to worry about fitting in booths at restaurants. I want to be able to walk without my knees, ankles and feet killing me. I want to really live and no longer be ashamed of who I am and what I look like.   I am looking forward to wearing clothes that are small and pretty. Lets face facts here... plus sized clothes are just not that attractive. Clothing designers for the plus sized market don't make clothes that are youthful. When your the size I am now it's hard to find things that aren't geared toward older or professional women. Stretch pants and t-shirts are my entire wardrobe and I am sick of them! I want to shop at places like the Gap and Old Navy which I have never been able to do. I want to buy matching bra and panty sets that don't cost $60 (like the plus-size).  I also want to see people from my past and show off the new me. Most have only ever known me as fat, and I would love to see their reaction to the new me. There is one man in particular that I used to be interested in. When I met him I was still under 300 pounds but slowly creeping up higher and higher. By the time our friendship ended I was at about 335... I have since gained more obviously. When we met he thought I was too big and should lose some weight. I only went on to gain... but I want to see him, with me being in a great relationship and thinner then I have ever been and show him just what he missed out on by focussing solely on my weight.   I want to start my journey to motherhood. I want to be able to get pregnant, because at the size I am now it's not happening. I want to have a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby. I want to enjoy my children growing up, and I want to be able to play with them without being too tired or too sore. I want to run and jump and enjoy them as much as I possibly can. I want to be able to set a good example and teach my kids better eating habits then what I grew up with, I can hardly wait!   Like I said... some things are petty and some are not, but one day I will live them all.   385.12#",

        "blog_text": "Today I have been mostly wondering why I blog. I think it goes back to my days running a fanzine in the early 80s. I started co-editing a role-playing games fanzine called Quasits and Quasars with a school friend called Dave Hulks, and then struck out on my own into the world of postal games with what was known at the time as a personal zine. These zines were often intensely personal affairs with editors discussing matters close to their hearts, reviewing films, comics, books and games, exchanging letters of comment with readers and running a few games of postal diplomacy to give the thing an excuse to run to reasonable deadlines. The physical effort in producing one of these zines was considerable though - typing the pages on a manual typewriter, cutting and pasting artwork (with real scissors and glue), letrasetting headlines, duplicating the required number of copies, posting to the subscribers and maintaining accounts that would in no way pay for the time, effort and materiel involved. There was no real reason to do it, other than for the resultant ego boost and the contact with like minded individuals around the country and occasionally the world. My zine folded when I came to university and ran out of time and money. Fast forward ten years or so, and something else triggered a need to write. My wife at the time and myself were expecting a baby, but something went wrong and Ethan was still born. It was a terrible time and the only way I found to express the way I was feeling was to write it down. Eventually, I wrote an account of the experience and posted it to a support newsgroup on the internet. I received dozens of replies and continued correspondences with people who had had similar experiences for years afterwards. The story is still archived in a couple of places, and I still get occasional emails every two or three months from people and I offer what support and encouragement I can in response. The newsgroup uk.media.radio.archers was the next area that I explored. It has been described as 'a newsgroup for the sort of people who might listen to the Archers' and I have been reading and posting there for six years or so now. I've laughed at the jokes and fish puns, discussed serious issues and seen people fall out and make-up, been to several real-life barbeques and wept bitter tears for the three umrats I have known who have passed away over the years. People who I have only known as phosphor dots on a screen have become a real community to me. The blogsphere is a similar community, in some ways more diffuse than a newsgroup and in other ways much more personal and intense. People carve out their own little corners of cyberspace and invite others to join them. There are real people on the other side of the screen",

Denial & Isolation \nFunctions as a buffer after shocking news \nGives the person time to mobilize other defenses, coping strategies \nPerson may be willing at a later time  to discuss death when they are ready to face it.\n\nII. Anger \nParticularly good time for Respite care from Hospice \nFamily and staff can find this very difficult to cope with \nAnger displaced and projected outward…can be random \nLoss of control of person can manifest itself as rage and anger \nAnger can focused inward as well \nAsk yourself if you are withdrawing from this person…Are your visits shorter?  Are you avoiding contact?  Is the family? \nIt is important the person be allowed to be themselves…hostile, demanding, angry…without being judged and rejected.\n\nIII. Bargaining \nThis is attempt to postpone the death. Person wants to be rewarded for “Good Behavior” \nOften living for one special event…wedding, graduation \nImplicit promise that Pt. Will not ask for another favor if this one is granted \nMost bargains are made with God and are usually kept secret.\n\nIV.

        "blog_text": "We started off the evening by going to a bar that I knew all of my friends were going to be at.  I hated every minute of it; I didn't want to share him with them.  God knows I love my new found friends to no end, but I share so much of my day, my life, my room, my meals, my school, and my nights with them.  Michael was the only thing that was all mine in Spain.  I didn't want to share.  Call it childish, but having him all to myself made me feel like I had a little piece of home.  We quickly said our goodbyes to my friends and I finally had him all to myself again.  Michael, my new friend, and now my little piece of home.        We went to a great salsa club, sitting down at what we claimed to be “the best seats in this here place'.  We got into a more personal, a more deep, and a more fun conversation.  The words “I wish you didn't have a boyfriend” hit me like cannon ball to the stomach.  I could have just picked myself up, dusted myself off, and ended it right then and there.  I did not end it; instead, I just smiled politely, and lowered my head as if I had just been told an embarrassing compliment.  What was I doing there with him?  I knew he liked me.  I once again asked myself why I was dancing with him, and why I was smiling.  What was it about him that night that made me stay for as long as I did?  Was it the way we found it humorous how we both walked at the same fast-pace around the cold city?  Was it the way the light hit his face when we were on that ledge looking over the city, or the bridge looking over the river?  I think I knew what it was that sent me over the edge so-to-speak.        It’s really is strange how a common interest in music can bond  people together.  He knew and loved all of my favorite music artists, and even worse, knew all of the lyrics to my favorite songs.      We walked arm in arm together around the city singing quite loudly to random songs.  I had never met a guy who without even trying, sang so well.  I could have listened to him serenade to me for days.  I did not want the night to end, but we were heading so near to my apartment, that I had to think of something.  So, to stretch the night out, and inevitably get myself into more emotional trouble then I already had, I brought down a handful of CD's and a portable CD player.  What the hell was I thinking?  Music had an intoxicating effect on me with him.  We walked to a small secluded park by my place and I showed him my music.  Every song sounded better than the next with him next to me.        REALITY CHECK: What is a girl who is crazy in love with her boyfriend, back at home,  doing with a guy that she just met no more than two days before, in a park, at 3 in the morning, listening to romantic music?       I asked myself that question dozens of times that night, hoping that it would knock some sense into me, but it failed. Songs with titles like 'Your Body is a Wonderland', 'Nearness of You', and 'Come Away with Me' drove me to want to bite my tongue off after asking him to dance with me. But turned out, I didn't want to be anywhere in the world but there, listening to the timeless sounds of Norah Jones while I was slow dancing in circles with Michael underneath a tree. For hours and hours we danced underneath that tree, so much that we made a mock 'crop circle', it surprised us, we laughed, and kept dancing.  It started to rain, but all it did was make me want to get closer.  My cheeks would barely caress his face.  I feared making eye contact for too long.  Tears secretly ran down my face.  I got closer to Michael that night then I had ever gotten close to any other man since my first date with my boyfriend.   I never thought that I would be here; I never thought that I would do this.  It had been less than two weeks since I said goodbye to the love of my life at the airport.  And here I was, having the most fun that I had on this trip since.  I had a split personality mentality throughout the entire night.  One part of me wanted nothing more than to dance with him, hold him, touch his skin, and gently kiss those lips all night long.  Then the other part of me wanted nothing more than to run away, take my music, and run my ass home, and hope that I never see this intoxicating, hypnotic man ever again.   I stayed, and had the most horribly great time of my life.  My Norah Jones CD had never sounded so romantic, it had also never been played so many times consecutively, poor CD, poor Michael for having to walk home at eight in the morning, and poor me for being left along with my thoughts, my guilt, my desires.   You'd think that I would have learned from that night.  You would think.  Oh but no.  I was right there with him again, a couple of nights later. . .                            . . .

Flowers, although devoid of their daily hues, were still offering their amorous perfume, and while birds were in distant slumber, crickets were providing the symphony of the night…  They were the only ones who were witnessing that night’s wonder and Mina thought it was best that way.  They were holding each other’s hands, looking at each other’s eyes, feeling each other’s warmth.  And the whole place was engulfed in silence.

When light fully entered her eyes, she closed them quickly.  The light seemed foreign to her.  She has not been used to it ever since he left.

She went back to her bed and laid there, not knowing what to do next.  She thought of the dream.  It was different from the others she had in the past.  It was more vivid, more lucid.  She really felt his hands, his warmth and his heartbeat.  She could still hear the crickets, and the fragrance still caresses her nose.  It appears to have happened just minutes ago. And his voice, his plea; it still echoes in her ears.  She began to cry.  \nIt was dusk and they were both lying on the grass, looking at the sky’s fading and morose light.  There were no clouds, no birds, no wind.  Mina was smiling, for they were together.  But, his countenance was filled with uncertainty.  She wondered why.  Suddenly he stood and said, “Mina, I have to go.” Startled, she replied,” Why? It’s still early.” He helped her stand up, looked at her and uttered, “I really have to go.” “Oh, sure.  I’ll call you, ok?” “Don’t” “Huh, why?” “Because I have to go.”  And she understood.  It was over.  She lowered as the wind finally announced its presence. Leaves began to rustle.  She wouldn’t cry.  She never cried in front of him.  Then she heard again his voice.  This time it seemed far away, though he is still near.  “I loved you, Mina.  God knows how much I loved you.  But, it’s all over now.  I wanted to tell you sooner but I didn’t have the courage.  I have fallen out of love, Mina.  I’m sorry.  I hope you understand.  Please understand.”  “I understand.”  That was all she could say.  “Thank you.  Please move on.  I wish you luck.  I wish you happiness.  Listen, I’m just not the right man for you, ok?  You’ll find him soon.”  “I know.”  He looked up.  He seemed to be thinking of the right words to say. And finally, he said solemnly, “Mina, have a final glimpse of light.  Night is coming.”  With that said, he walked away just as leaves and tears began to fall.  \nShe went to her drawer and found it.  Her face was still drenched with tears.  She walked again towards the windows, but this time very slowly.  She stood there for a long time, gazing at nothing, but thinking of him.

        "blog_text": "I have received an answer to my prayers, and now I can be confident enough to share my testimony; the story of Christ working his miraculous wonders in me. My “pilgrimage,” and I use that word loosely, began when 9th grade had just started. I went to Mark Keppel High School for a week only (long story), and made my return back to the school in which I belonged, Temple City. The very first day I came happened to be the same day where an enormous Christian meeting was being held in the morning. A large circle of people were gathered around the flagpole, singing worship songs. At that time, I had no idea why a crowd of people were singing to a flagpole, but soon enough, I found out. I forget how many months later I had first asked Eric about that meeting. We were in Orchestra, and he told me all about them, the Christian Club. Then, he also began telling me about Christianity itself. And so I learned the story of Jesus Christ. Eric had kindly given me his New King James Bible and told me to read John. Some point around that time, I had decided to attend church. Around this period, I called myself a 'Christian' but acted nothing of the sort. I did not know Jesus personally; he was only a mysterious 'miracle-worker' in the background of my life. So naturally, when I went to church, I felt nothing special. It was just a room where a bunch of freaks held their hands in the air, as if to touch something that, obviously, did not exist. Delusional psychos, I thought. Of course, I wasn’t completely turned off by Christianity. There was always something that lured me into the Bible and the story of the Crucifixion. And all the while, I always felt that I was missing something; that the day I lived seemed cratered with a hole, what was it? Why am I not content with where I am? With who I am? I wanted to go to church again. But now, my parents, well, my mother, forbid me to go. She said she didn’t like Christians, and that they were always so pushy, and not the sort of crowd that was good for me. I burned with anger. What kind of authority did she have to criticize these people? At this time, I was still very confused. There I was, saying she had no authority to bash on Christians, and there I was again, saying they were all psychos. The best way I can describe how I felt and thought, is that I wanted to believe in Jesus, but I did not. It was still a “fad” and the stories of the Bible weren’t true. February, 2004, my friends, Stuart and Ben, went on a Christian retreat with Eric and John. I had planned to go, but my mother said no at the last minute. When they came back, I was shocked. Stuart, the once Kevin-your-gay-and-your-a-homo had turned into a devout Christian. Ben, the once I-almost-made-it-into-wah-ching-but-my-friends-told-on-me-so-I-had-to-do-3-months-of-counseling, had also become a follower of Christ. Stupid fools, I roared. (To myself). How is it possible that they had fallen into the hole of retardedness? How is it possible they had believed all of this nonsense that is the essence of Christianity? I did not know, I only knew that they were making big mistakes. After some convincing from them, I decided to go back church. Except, once again, my mother said no. So there I was, talking to Eric about what she said, when John told me that we could all go and pray. I was uneasy and a bit reluctant because I knew prayers never worked. When people prayed, they gave false hope to themselves, they were euphemistically portraying the world with someone to always watch over them, but I knew for sure that life was cruel, and no manner of prayer could change that. Or so I naively thought. I remember the hallway being very dark, chilly was the weather, and cloudy were the skies. We huddled around in a small circle, and started to pray. As I heard each person go, John, Ben, Stuart, then Eric, I realized that these people weren’t my friends. They were somehow different. As if innocent, as if 'blessed.' The words they spoke were not theirs, it couldn’t have been. I was becoming very cold, and I could feel the wind start to brush up against my face. As they spoke, I felt as if I wasn’t there. As if I was floating around, just surveying the events that were taking place. Then I felt it. Something, as if it had life, was bearing over me. Like I was being squeezed from all sides, I became weak. When Eric had finished, I collapsed on the floor. The next thing I knew, I was in the restroom with toilet paper in my hands. I looked into the mirror and saw my reflection. I was crying. But I couldn’t feel the tears rolling down my cheeks. Why? Why were the tears weightless? My eyes weren’t red. Why was that? I was confused, no doubt. When I came out, Josh told me that people had started to gather around. The bell rang, and I was still feeling subconscious. As I headed for my class, I couldn’t ignore it anymore. I cried because of Christ; because He is the living Lord, because the presence of the Holy Spirit was felt. Right then and there, I was absolutely positive that God is real. That God really did create the Heavens and the Earth. That God really did send His only Son to die for our sins. Today, I am part of that 'delusional psychos' crowd. But it's different when I'm at church now. I feel it. I feel Jesus, and his sovereign place in the world. I feel the King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords, just singing along with us. I feel His glory, it's warm, it's bright, it's powerful. Today, I am finally content with where I am. I no longer question what's missing, for the answer is obvious. The hole that had once been so great and massive has been reduced to nothing, filled by Christ’s love and devotion for me and the rest of humanity. Today, that mysterious miracle worker is no longer a hidden shadow, but a living, breathing, life force that gives me the strength to carry on. Today, I pray at least twice a day. My friends, (Eric, Ben, Stuart, John), and I hold a prayer meeting everyday. We give Thanks to the Heavenly Father for the magnitude of Grace beyond our imaginations. We praise Him for his eternal Love and Sacrifice, the deeds He did for people such as us; corrupt in spirit, and lost in soul. Today, I no longer wonder why 75% of America believes in Christ, but why Christ believes in us. It's utterly amazing how, we, who are so guilty of sin, who have spat on God's holy name, who have commited deeds so foul, Satan rejoices; Jesus still died on that cross, so that we are no longer guilty, so that God's name remains paramount around the world, so that Satan wimpers in fear, so that the deeds so foul have been forgiven. Today, God tells me this isn't my testimony. That the 21 paragraphs about how I met Him are nothing compared to what will happen. And that the real story of Christ Jesus in me, has yet to begin.",

        "blog_text": "I never meant to cause you pain. I never thought I'd be the one who took the fall. I got lost in the moment. I have an addictive personality. As a child, I was hooked on milk for years. Yes, milk. I'd drink four-pint bottles at a time. Which is probably why I've never broken any significant bones and have such beautiful teeth. I grew up on a diet that was 90% calcium. I took up smoking at the age of fourteen. I was a three-a-day man for about four years, but when I got to university, that suddenly shot up to twenty-a-day. It's stayed there ever since, apart from the occasional, half-arsed attempt to quit. I had my first alcoholic drink at around about the same time I had my first cigarette. I didn't really enjoy drinking, though. As a teenager, I'd hang around on street corners with my friends and drink Diamond White or cheap Belgian lager from Tesco, but I never did it when I was by myself. To be honest, it was always a peer pressure thing. My first real experience of drinking was at university. I described it briefly in the post that precedes this one. I went off the rails in quite spectacular fashion for several months. It wasn't that big a deal, though. I recovered from the wobble, and life went on. Two things happened to change this. First, I became friendly with a guy called Chris. We worked together at Borehamwood cinema, and quickly discovered a shared love of the Evil Dead films and loud guitars. We started hanging out, going to see films and hitting the pub...all the usual things friends do. Then, one night when we'd only just begun to enjoy our drinking, it was suddenly eleven o'clock. We found ourselves back out on the streets with nothing to do and nowhere to go. It was pay-day, though, and we both had money in our wallets. Enough for a jaunt into London? Indeed. Chris and I had such a good time that we vowed to have a proper night out every Friday, whether others came with us or not. After a while, this became every Friday and Saturday. Then every weekend and occasionally on weeknights. At the start, we weren't drinking all that much. But the more often we went out, the harder it became to get drunk. The amount we spent on booze increased dramatically, and our nights out became the stuff of myth and legend amongst our friends and co-workers. They accompanied us less and less often as our trips into the city slipped further into the realm of the insane. I would wake up aching and ill, unable to clearly recall what I'd done the night before. I lost count of the times I regained consciousness to find myself in some unexpected location. Park benches, bus stops, benches, strange beds. Over a period of eighteen months or so, I did them all regularly. The second thing that happened was that I took a management position at The Coronet cinema in Notting Hill Gate. My monthly pay doubled and I found myself out on the town almost every night, rarely taking the time to think about what I was doing or why. I worked at The Coronet for almost two years. During that time I was hospitalised on three separate occasions, once for splitting my head open whilst attempting to jump off a table at the LA2, and twice for drinking myself into unconsciousness. My third and final visit to the casualty department of University College Hospital came about when I drank so much absinthe I nearly died. I took care after that. I knew my limits, and I stayed well within them. Nonetheless, I was still drinking heavily on a regular basis until I left the cinema and had to cut back for financial reasons. It helped that I was in a long-term relationship at that point. While my girlfriend was no stranger to the depravities of excessive drinking, she didn't have the problems staying away that I did. Her influence was good for me and - with a couple of exceptions - I stayed relatively straight for a couple of years. I took the eventual break-up well, I think, and there was certainly no repeat of my previous behaviour. I still drank, but always in moderation. Such a relative term, that one. Moderation. Without the financial burden of a full-time relationship over a considerable distance, I began to retreat into myself as I always do when there is nothing of note going on in my life. Chris had found his own long-term relationship, and it took him out of my life and away up north, where he and his partner bought a house together. I continued to struggle with my first novel and took a part-time bar job. I'd work three or four nights a week and wrestle with words the rest of the time, usually accompanied by a bottle of supermarket-brand bourbon. Looking back, I'd guess I was getting through maybe four of these in a week. That trend continued when I moved away from home. I was living above a pub, and it was all too easy to get hold of alcohol. This wasn't helped by the fact that one of my managers was clearly afflicted by the same disease. It's now almost a year since the end of that last relationship. I moved back home just over three weeks ago and immediately settled into the familiar routine. I wrote, I worked on the blog and surfed the internet, and I drank. In a way, it was writing this little journal that made me take a long, hard look at my life. It got me analysing myself in a way I'd long since forsaken. The image in my head, of the alcoholic, chain-smoking writer, sitting in front of his computer trying to write the poison out of his soul, no longer seemed so attractive. I was putting on weight. I wasn't sleeping. I felt spaced out and mildly ill most of the time. I realised it was the limits. Always the limits. For Chris and I, the drinking and the partying started out as fun and then mutated into what it truly was: An escape. The more we realised this truth, the more we tried to outrun it. The faster we ran, the more likely it became that we'd hit the wall. And part of us, part of whatever that strange symbiosis was, desired the impact. The night this became clear to me was the night of the absinthe binge. And I know, with the benefit of hindsight, that what I did that night I did deliberately. I didn't run for the wall, I threw myself at it. I saw my limit, and I decided to go through it. Into The White, as the song goes. It isn't the taste of alcohol, though I enjoy it. It isn't the feeling of being drunk, though I thrive on it. It's the limits that attract me. Something in me has to know them and flirt with them. I feel dead sometimes. I feel empty. And when you feel that way, knowing that there's a place where you can creep right up to the edge, where your body screams and burns and your mind has to process more than it can handle and you feel so fucking alive...well, it's an attractive proposition. I quit drinking last week. Not forever, because it's a crutch I know I'm going to be needing again. But for now. I've taken up cycling. I've started looking for a new kind of limit. It's out there, I know it is. Tonight, riding hard up a steep hill with my lungs on fire and my thigh muscles spasming in protest, I felt it. Adrenaline and alcohol are both about heat, and in a lot of ways they're alike. I know this because I lay on my bed a couple of hours ago, sweating and shaking and struggling for breath, my body protesting at the harsh regime I'd imposed on it. And you know what? I wanted to go out and try a little harder.",

        "blog_text": "I mentioned earlier that the only societal hangup I haven't managed to duck is weight. Ironically, I was oblivious to it until I graduated from high school. I went from having five or six school activities, skipping lunch, and eating dinner at home, to having a desk job, eating out for lunch and sometimes dinner, and having little time for anything outside of that. So I gained weight. I never would have thought about it, except my stepmother said something along the lines of 'What, you think that now that you found a guy you can just let yourself go?' I really don't know where that came from. It was a very out of character comment for her, and I like to pretend aliens were controlling her at the time.  After that, it was a niggle in the back of my mind. Now, I'm a big girl by any standards, 5'10, valued for my ability to take a hit and not fall over in soccer.... And I had always been okay with that, and sometimes even proud. It was muscle and height and I liked being 'the strong one'. But now I was fretting sometimes - what was muscle? What was fat? In college, my weight fluctuated dramatically, mostly due to depression. When I came home for a visit, and my bf said 'Wow, you've lost a lot of weight!' I hadn't even noticed. Suddenly, that was in my head. Maybe if I lost enough weight, he'd want to be with me. Pathetic, but true.  I was an eating disorder waiting to happen. Fortunately, I have the self-discipline of a slug, and thus anorexia was out of the question. And I hate puking, so bulimia was too. I guess that means I wasn't seriously neurotic enough about it. But it didn't get bad until five years or so ago. Once again, someone else's comments triggered it. My fiance and I were arguing about our sex life, and I was complaining that he didn't seem to want to sleep with me very often. He replied 'Well, maybe if we both lost some weight, I would feel more like it.'  That hurt. And while he said 'we', what I heard (and still hear) is 'I'. And then things got ugly. I'd go shopping for clothes and break down into tears. We joined a gym, which I hated every minute of going to. I didn't see results. I got frustrated. I cried some more. I raged some more. I let myself feel more and more inadequate. Our sex life continued to suck. This went on until last fall.  I was getting ready to go to New Orleans, and I wanted to look good. I hadn't seen my friends there in a year or so, and I wanted them to be surprised. I worked out five or six days a week. I ate well. I drank water. I drank less booze, though that was more to be a lightweight, and thus a cheaper drunk on the trip. And it worked. I felt good. I bought new clothes.  And then the relationship blew up. And I lost control of my depression and just stopped caring. And now the weight is back. I spent a long, long time feeling not good enough. No more. I will *not* let my weight define me, or ruin my life. Nor will I let myself beat up myself for being fat.  There are several reasons I've gotten to this point. B, you're one of them. When we first started talking, your sincere compliments were exactly what I needed. Thank you. My new guy is another. He so obviously means it when he calls me gorgeous, and there's no qualifiers there. I never realized (or let myself realize) that it wasn't all my problem. That my ex had the issue, too - and it wasn't all my fault he didn't want me for who I was.  This is so freeing I can't even articulate it. I share the blame for what happened, but I've learned from it. And I'm stronger because of it. And maybe someday I'll be skinnier, too.",

I wouldn't say drunk, maybe, but it sure was the 'been drinking' dial ;) I was drinking by myself :'''''( \n\nIf you ever need to call, call. If I'm here, I will pick up.

It is hard to *get tough* when he gets like that - I know he hurts, but I don't know how much he's acting out - pressing my button - every other time I've almost gone, all he had to do was cry and I lost all confidence. This time, if he can't be a big boy, I'm going to have to just buckle down and get 'mean' with him, I guess. *sigh* Why do we have to make things harder than they need to be? *ouch*\n\nIt looks like things are going OK now in this respect, or at least have improved since I received this email. I'm glad that he is at least trying to be civil with me in real life, even if when I leave he hates me. I had to force myself to stop thinking about you. I got close to 'run away to Dennis' thinking - when I was trying to have Paul hold me - trying to hold him - he just can't do it right anymore... It was hard - I really had to THINK --- concentrate on the moment instead of dreaming it away with you in my head. I know I need to feel all of this - I can't lean you thoughts of you too much - this is for me, after all. What's the point if I don't get anything out of it?\n\nI'm glad you see that. I'm glad you are trying to do that. I want you to be done with that (as much as you can be) before you start this. Ha! Who am I kidding...we've already STARTED this.... What's the point if I build you up to some superhuman mystical creature that you can't possibly live up to in real life anyway?\n\nI know. That's what I was concerned that we were doing all along by doing all of this email/aim stuff and not seeing each other in person so much. But now that we've spent time together in real life, I realize that the aim/email showed us the TRUE us, the us that we are in real life without the distractions, without the filters that are required in order to live day to day. It allows us to be ourselves without fear when we're together. It accelerated our 'getting to know each other' process tremendously, and was a positive thing. I know it has brought us closer than we would have been otherwise. I can't imagine our history being any other way.\n\nPaul sees how much I love you - he saw it Thursday night. He felt like a third wheel. I told him that THAT is the REAL me - the me I can't be around him, the me that comes out when I'm at work, with friends, home alone - the me that runs away when Paul comes home, the me that he has hurt so many times. I guess we really can't stay married if he's not married to ME, can we?\n\nAnd I know you've told him a lot more since then (just got off the phone w/you;-) and I'm glad that he's taking it as well as he is. I'm actually GLAD that he was there today. I got to look him face to face and be honest with him.

I would keep myself, I would find a way.'\n\nI know that song is HURT. We can only be us. We can only play out these cards we've been so absolutely lucky to get dealt. Let's enjoy winning this round of cards, even if we don't end up going home with all of the money. You can have a lot of fun gambling, even if you don't win. Although I think we've got a steady supply of aces up our sleeves, and I KNOW we're both smart enough to play this game without losing it all.

No more *coughing* - I'm just not going to get more involved as in anything 'official' - just hangin out is enough for me at the moment. I WANT more, don't get me wrong, I want to be with you totally. But we've agreed that it's worth waiting for, so until then... That's what I mean :)\n\nI understand. We've made ourselves quite clear, and I respect you along with your opinions. We'll find our way as we go along. Things change. We'll just have to see what the future brings us.\n\nI'm waiting :-) :-) :-) I'd be crazy not to. What we have has finally sunken into my thick head. What we have is so special, I'd be a complete friggin idiot to not give it a little time. I mean, where else am I going to find someone like you that is so compatible with me? Nowhere! That's where! The fact that you're saving yourself for me makes me feel very loved.\n\nLOL - just so you know, that doesn't necessarily rule out sport fucking for either of us ;) I mean, dang, I gotta work on that total, right? ;) ;) ;) Since I'm competing with Karla and all...\n\nI'm not comfortable with the thought of you 'sport fucking'. The other day I said that if you had to, to not tell me about it. The more I think about it, the more I realize that I just don't want you to be with anyone else but me. And I surely don't want to be with anyone else but you!!! Please do not go down that road with me..... I can't say what my reaction will be :-/\n\nYour 'total' and sexual history means nothing to me. The only thing I care about is your sexual future ;-) I only compare you to Karla because you're the only 2 women I know well enough to know your sexual histories. You are not competing with her, and don't feel like you are. I love both of you. Her as someone I've known forever and did LOVE like that once..... I guess there's a part of me that still loves her like that....always will be....but I'm over it and understand that she and I are just not compatible. And I just don't want to be with her in the same way I want to be with you. In my mind, there is no competition, only you. She is my friend, and I will continue to be her friend, but you are the person I choose as my lover. 100%.\n\nHrm, I think I'll like being single for a while - I'm not sure - haven't thought it out totally. I don't want to leap straight from BIG relationship to BIG relationship, at least that's how I feel today... I don't know - let me know how you feel about that?\n\nI want to go into this with you SLOWLY. I know you don't think we can do it, but I KNOW I can. I have to. I'm transitioning from a complete single person with NO responsibility to someone that wants to share his life with you in every way.....plus there's Chris... I need to do this slowly. Neither of us should feel trapped or like we're doing this for any other reason than because we love each other and we want to be here. What you said about being alone today on the phone worries me. That's exactly the kind of reasons that I want to go slow. I want you to have a chance to be a little bit alone. To realize that it's OK. To realize that you don't HAVE to be with me (or anyone!), and that you WANT to be with me.\n\nI just feel incredible pressure to do everything right. Have I mentioned that I can be a terrible perfectionist? Oh, yeah, and when I don't get things to work out the way I want them, I can sometimes get pissy and pouty? I can be a big baby when I want to. I'm not proud of that, but at least I know when I'm doing it. Sometimes I even do it on purpose! Depends on the situation - cause I don't give a shit about a lot of people I meet, and I have no problem using them to my own advantage. I sure do have a treacherous, ruthless side of myself. *edit* I do give a shit about you, so don't worry :)\n\nI'm a little like that too. I definitely feel a lot of pressure to not fuck this up. I really think we have a chance at something great here. It already is GREAT, but I want it to last.... I just want to learn 1 thing at a time instead of trying to learn physics over night ;-) Anyway, yes, I'm sure I need time - otherwise I will hurt you - hurt me, do this whole dance all over again. I totally see how the pattern repeats itself - people like to stay in grooves. I'm getting out of this groove - I'm going to skip my record. LOL - at least you are old enough to know what that analogy means :)\n\nWhatever you need, I will try to do. You asked me the other day on the phone if I thought we could stay apart and take some time. I said no. That's how I felt at the moment, but I will try if it means a greater chance of success for us. I do not believe that it affects our outcome. You were the person who ended it with Paul. You were over him long ago as far as I can tell.... He'll be the person 'rebounding'. I can play so nasty. Don't let me get away with it. I *need* a force in my life that is big enough to tell me NO. Sometimes I get pretty full of myself. Don't be afraid to 'slap me around' of course not literally, just give me a good *shake, DUH!!!*\n\nI can play nasty too.....if I have to. I don't like to, but I WILL defend myself and stick up for myself. And I will tell you if I think something you're doing is bad for you or bad for US. I remember a poem I wrote a long time ago - I have to find it. It was good. It was back when I knew myself better. I usually don't do well with poetry... I'm too picky grammatically. When I do bust one out, it's fucking awesome! :-D\n\nI knew you would be good at poetry. I have never really tried poetry, usually I just string some sentences together when I'm feeling extra artistic, not really a poem, but better than just regular text. Kinda like my email from the other day 'some words'.\n\n:-) I can't stop smiling. See what you do to ME? I'm glad. I'm just a little ray of sunshine *roll eyes* I'm so happy you 'get' me. I don't feel so fucking crazy now.\n\nYou felt crazy before?\n\nThat's your new nickname: Sunshine! ;-) Maybe Black Sunshine???\n\nIf I ever need you, you will know. Heck, I need you now, but not like that :-) I need you in my arms. I need your eyes to look into. *sigh* I want that too, and just that. I don't need anything else right now! I know *exactly* what you are saying!\n\n:-) Yep, we're going to have a lot of fun together for sure! And spend a lot of time in each other's arms!!! \n\nAnd handling your thong isn't the same as getting in your pants..... but it could be! It would be if I was *wearing* it, now wouldn't it??? \n\nuhm.... I don't know...technically. Let's try it?\n\nAnd I got tubular exhaust pipes, mufflers, axle shafts, cheater pipes, catalytic converters, and intermediate shafts. ;-) Ooooh, Dennis! Don't stop! \n\nHow about camshafts, pushrods, lifters, driveshafts, output shafts, and shift rods?\n\nI know you are changing more than your lifestyle right now. This will be a big change for me too. I've never had someone to care about like this before. Someone to be with. Someone to love like this. Someone to think about a future with. Well, I will help where I can. I don't want to sway you - sometimes I think I must have made you into the person you are somehow - maybe it's all a digital illusion. But then I see you in the real world, and you're the same. I remember when we first started talking, and I know that you were pressing buttons from day one. You have to be real - it's really you - why on earth would someone fake this much for me? Why on earth would you even begin to consider the things you've said to me if you weren't 100% real?\n\nThanks for the offer to help ;-) I think the best thing you can do to help is just be you :-) And be understanding while I adjust :-) \n\nYep, I'm real. What do you mean by pressing buttons? LOL - well, living with someone is like living with your parents. \n\nOH NO! NOT THAT!!!! ANYTHING BUT THAT!!! :-O LOL! You have to respect them, but there are times when you feel like getting away, taking a trip, hanging out with your buddies, whatever. Sometimes you do nothing, sometimes you fight, sometimes you bonk heads while you're both trying to brush your teeth at the same time :-D It's a lot of time to spend with one person - it can get intense. Intense in all ways. Meh, but I'm easy - treat me good and I'll treat you good. That's about all there is to getting along with me :)\n\nI understand what you are saying. You aren't really telling me anything that I didn't already sort of know, I do live at home you know ;-) Maybe before too long we'll get to find out what living with each other is like for real? I mean PLAY house, not jump all the way into it... like I said on the phone.\n\nYes, I do CARE about you, all of you, what's in your head, what's in your heart, all of you. Every aspect. YOU as a whole.\n\nThanks. Thank you. Thank you thank you thank you! You have no idea how nice that feels!\n\n:-) No problem :-) I'm glad to make you feel good!\n\nLOL! Finally, I get to take your virginity at SOMETHING, lol! You can have all of the other kinds I have left too ;) You got my drag racing virginity already. And I want your rollercoaster virginity such as it is...\n\n;-) You will get my roller coaster virginity soon enough ;-) \n\nAnd there's always your 'uncut' virginity for me to take :-D \n\nThe longer I wait to do something, the more worked up I get about it. After we kiss the first time, I'll be fine, lol. I'm just silly like that! I'll all about making big deals out of nothing ;) Doh - I mean I *posted* on OT when something was bothering me :o :o :o :o OMG - I am still affected by telling you that :o I'm a dork! I can't believe you got that out of me!\n\nI guess I really don't need to say much about kissing now, other than I need to develop more skills at it! What you've got out of me is all that I know, lol. Hmm... I've read a bunch of things about how to have better sex but not one thing about developing my kissing skills! Maybe I'll change that... This question will have answered itself within 36 hours.\n\nIt did :-D A peck never hurt anything, BTW, if you feel that would be easier. Whatever - I'm easy, like I've said.\n\nWell, that's how I broke the ice... with a peck, sorta. Now I'm pretty comfy and would like to just sit and 'practice' w/you, develop some new skeelz ;-) Do some REAL kissing :-D \n\nYES!!! Honesty rawks! ;-) This fact alone increases our odds of relationship success by a power of 100. Seriously.\n\nI know. You have an idea, I'm sure, but you'll never truly understand what it means to me that you are honest with me. Even at the risk of sounding bad. I don't mind feeling sad if it is for a good reason. I just don't do well with senseless pain - hurting someone just to hurt them. I'd rather be told something when it is a tiny complication than have to hear it when it seems like the end of the world, ya know?\n\nI agree 100%. No argument from me.\n\nI agree, as much as I want to be with you now, I want to be with you the RIGHT way even more. We are lucky and smart to have been good this long :-) You are worth waiting for too. Trust me. I can wait. Like I said, where else will I find someone like you that is so compatible with me? Just don't go gettin all friendsy on me while I'm waiting, OK? Don't worry that I will! I want to fuck you like I've never wanted to fuck someone before!!! You are better than porn, even better than my own imagination. You are super sexy. And I'm not kidding.\n\n:o I know you're not kidding. I know it, but I still don't fully believe it. No, that's not right either, I DO believe it. I don't completely comprehend it! *found the word I was searching for*\n\n'I want to fuck you like I've never wanted to fuck someone before!!!' -- you know, you can say that to me a million times if you want to. Thank you! It makes my eyes roll back reading that. *whew* :-D Good grief I like you, and you do make it so very hard to be good. That will still sound good after you've been fucking me for years and years. If I can only keep you interested that long ;)\n\nDon't worry. I'll always tell you how I feel, and I'm sure I can come up with something more romantic than that by the time we're old :-D \n\nYou realize that we've gotten ourselves back to where we were quite a while back. I think we *knew* this is where to stop for now. We just had to feel it... Thinking it wasn't enough.\n\nYes, I agree. We had to wait until we were acclimated to the feelings that are so powerful to both of us.\n\nDo you think the fact that you haven't been here before is an obstacle for us? I mean if it sounds this good with an 'unavailable' married woman, how much better would it be with someone else? Someone who could be truly yours without the wait? Someone with extra (more than any other human) baggage? Someone unattached with no children? Will you ever wonder?\n\nNO. I want you. I want ONLY you. I wouldn't trade you for anyone else. I've met so many women, but you're the only one that has tripped my trigger like this. How much do you think I had to like you originally to pursue you even though you were married, had a child, smoked, and live 80+ miles away? My feelings for you have only grown since I met you and got to know you better. Why would I risk losing someone like you for a chance at some bimbo?\n\nOR Damn you're lucky! Maybe that's the way it is supposed to work out! The first time you *really* feel it like that - cause you're careful with your feelings. Maybe, if I would have been awake, I would have noticed - felt the zing the first time I saw you - whatever it was. But I always miss it. It didn't take long once I got to talking to you - it was a *powerful* zing!\n\nYep. I can sum most people up in about 5min and know whether I want to know them well or not. By the end of the Dave/trans meeting you were stuck in my head, a small note on a stick pin that said 'This woman is quite promising.' THEN I found out you were married! ACK! Now what? Friends?.... and you know the whole story so why rehash yet again?\n\n(someone has been thinking again!) \n\nGuess what? Regret is a waste of spirit. Pretty good, huh? Too bad it isn't mine. I am sampling again :)\n\nYes, regret is a waste of time. I don't regret anything I've done since I first met you. And I want to make damn sure I don't regret anything I do now!\n\nI still have your IM from this morning open. I like to keep them around to read over and over now. I memorize everything you say to me anymore. With my quasi-photographic memory ;)\n\nLike I said in real life, I keep your aims open too, and save the good ones when I remember :-) I don't so much memorize everything, but I do remember all of the important details :-)\n\nI love you\n\nI love you TOO!\n\nGuess what? At some point, after the paperwork is all getting done and what not, I'm going to visit Mookie! He lives in Philadelphia. I've always wanted to see the big cities on the east coast. He's going to show me all of the good historical stuff out there. I'm a sucker for history. And he's going to buy me a cheese steak - he claims to know where the best one in town can be found. And if I'm super lucky, he's going to cook me dinner - gotta love those Italian guys ;) (((for food, of course!))) Oh, and I get to stick it in his butt! Hehehehe! That's a running joke of ours - he promised me his ass once, and I'm going to take him up on it ;) (LOL, not, but you already know how I feel about that anyway.) If he's super, super lucky, I might fix his POS Neon for him. The best way I know how, the secret overnight transmission swap ;) Er, wait, should I repaint it? You know, Bright Jade is a super ghey color. HAAAAAY, maybe you and Mookie should hook up, you fucking fags! :p Just remember, I called video! And if I'm SUPER SUPER lucky, Don will come up too - so I can finally get my fucking ride he promised me! AND I can check out my second favorite Neon in the whole world :) (er, I mean 3rd favorite, of course I love the ACR, cause you twiddled it! I can't see that car without thinking of you...)\n\nReading that paragraph makes me VERY happy :-) It lets me know that you are feeling happy and free. I like knowing I that played a part in helping you achieve your freedom and happiness. The last thing I want to do is take your freedom.\n\nOMG, speaking of cars, you've got me checking out Acclaims now. LOL the damn things are EVERYWHERE!!!! And I notice every single one of 'em. Gee, thanks :p\n\nYou've got me checking out R/T's....especially red 2dr ones w/ill plates!\n\nI think about you way too much, I think. :) \n\nI know I think about you too much :-)\n\nWell, my fingers are tired.\n\nIt took me more than 5 hours and 45 minutes to get through all of this - I had a few distractions along the way, and I read and reread it a lot more than I have been lately. I'm feeling edit-y today :) LOL - but I only fixed two things anyway.\n\nThis is the 2nd time I've poured my heart out in this email and dammit I'm saving it this time!!! My typing is starting to get very conversational with you and informal. Hehe, cause you ain't perfect either :)\n\nHey now! Make up your mind! Am I perfect or not??? ;-) :-D :-)\n\n*HUG* *****HUG****** \n\nI can't WAIT till tomorrow night. I am going to give you the best hug evar... \n\nLOL. More OT speak.\n\nYep, you did. You gave me LOTS of good hugs, and a couple of nice kisses :-)\n\nTalk to you tonight on AIM! Dennis",

Its most interesting to see what the rest of the world thinks (arg people blonde and busty does NOT always mean a 10 is required...ick) and how long ago the person checked their tally - a true contemporary exercise in vanity. 'Did I get my 10 yet?' And then there is the reverse as well, 'Lets see how low this picture will get.' Also I sense some of the pictures posted are to exact retribution and revenge...exes in a non photogenic moment, algebra teachers that gave you a C, your boss, your bosses daughter...etc. Then I also kind of feel bad sometimes giving low/honest scores. I think, 'oh their fragile ego.' And then I remind myself THEY put that picture up there most likely, and that they are inviting my opinion.   As the faces to rate go by, I would start seeing people who remind me of people I know....and I give them biased higher or lower marks depending on how much I liked the people they remind me of in the first place. Bad me! The military pics get an automatic low from me. The uniform thing just doesnt do a thing for me - and a gun in the pic is like an automatic -10. Armpit hair visible regardless of gender will also scare me deeply. Any underwear shots (ack) will also make me skip the pics.... I think I am harsher on 'typical' beauties, and 'standard' handsomes...I have a thing for geeks after all...Take one look at my hubby and you will know its true. Ah yes, I know some of you havent yet even seen a picture of him. I will rectify this when a) i get a digital camera and b) we moved to morgantown. my husband is direly afraid that this blog will get discovered by someone who knows someone who knows someone he works with and it will spill the beans about our move and somehow end up fired or something. soooooooooo i will keep his anonymity (also explaining my anonymity as well...psuedonyms and what not...) for now at least we shall remain nameless and faceless. There are no pics of me - actually none taken within two years are in existence...plus, as of yet for I would rather send in a picture taken 8 -10 months from now. I am in my hamster wheel of weight loss.  I am also harsher on the girls than the guys...and by far harder on people who have a stupefied facial expression or are wielding a bottle. Beer featuring pictures doth not a hottie make.  There is that little somewhat vain voice in my head that wants to submit an old picture of me to hotornot.com....but then i think 'oh but that will just be more affirmation that I once was hot and now am not'...i dont need that kind of reinforcement. Besides...what if I get rated a 4 or 3 or something...oh my fragile ego! Ha! Ironies will never cease.   There are some pretty skanky shots out there at hotornot.com...and shameless photos with kittens, puppies, babies, cleavage, posh cars, etc. in order to score higher points. And it makes me wonder does that cat really care if its 'hot'? I would ask my resident expert but he's snoozing on the futon flicking his tail occassionally in his kitty dreams. I wake the kitty only if i feel like living dangerously.  Then there are the people you dont want to vote as hot but must...the 'dude' with the IRA tatoo and holding a baby. We have shameless babyness, shameless bad boyness, and also blonde highlighted spikey hair, and potential armpit hair peekage...way overdone style. But in spite of all this he is still hot somehow. Then there is a girl who is in a prom shot that is in the black and white posh (not fashion) style...very posed, very primped, and reletively vacant looking...but even so she is undeniably hot. Not being blonde worked in her favor in this case. And what about the people who have obviously take their pic for the hotornot.com. If its quite clear that this is not some preexisting photo - thumbs down from me. And then once in a while you will come across a webcam shot so sincere and unposed...and authentic...not smiling...just viewing cyberspace as it were...and wondering 'will this make me look hot?' Once in a great many photos I found some of this category.   I also had my first day of day camp training today. Some familiar faces, and many new faces too. Alot more counselors in general than last year. Some people I was glad to see, and one or two that I thought to myself, 'did he/she HAVE to come back?' I know, I am a rotten person. And yes, I am still holding a spongebobsquarepants grudge over one counselor from last summer...who just generally annoys me to death no matter what anyways...  People were like, 'Oh we didnt recognize you with your hair cut!' And I was sitting there thinking, 'Yeah right admit it you didnt recognize me because of the extra 20-40 lbs.' They werent fooling me. I know I look different. I know I say the same thing to people when they have gained weight. Ah well. Its a world of somewhat painful, somewhat dishonest, and relatively transparent politeness. Which brings this blog full circle to hotornot.com.  There are some pictures of folks that either a) are getting sympathy votes, b) are voting for themselves for hours on end, or c) have to be a joke or something. I mean I am not exclusively talking about the appearance of the person...there is also the quality of the picture to consider...the distance of the photo...and whether or not the friend the person may have posed with is hotter than they are. Hello, if you are 20 feet from the camera, blurred, and in 35 dpi or something how in the hell am I supposed to rate anything other than a 1? *tries to shake a couple pictures in particular from my brain* Hot or Not? Why would anyone care what a worldfull of perfect strangers thinks? Then again, I am sure that if I click through the photos long enough I will see someone I know.  here's to post political correctness era manners...  all the news in fits of print -  mack  ps. you will have some catch-up reading to do but there is a new viewers guide for all of the new sluggite converters. not that its a cult or anything. but any comic with demoic kittens called 'the evil' is worth browse.    pps mystery rummy update: i kicked ass this evening. hehehe my revenge is exacted a little for totally getting skunked last night. whee!",

I've always had this personality that I can look like that nothing is bothering me. I can swap stories with anyone and even try to be the lively one in a conversation. But this is sometimes just try to make noise cause when the silence comes, so does that sadness. Here recently, I've been having two basic emotional states from which to operate... sobbing and flat-lining. Either I'm so filled with sadness that I can't keep from sobbing or feeling the urge but no tears will come from it, or I'm unable to feel anything but empty.   I heard once 'fake it till you make it'. I think that's where I am. It makes life a little harder, maybe, because I'm still expected to do the things I'm expected to do, though the world does allow quite a bit of leniency. I'm still expected to tend to my duties. I'm still expected to be respectful. I'm still expected to function. Sometimes the functioning is the hardest part. Submitting, being respectful, tending to my duties... those are a breeze, compared to functioning.  I know there is a name for this, and I know that name is depression. I also know that most people who don't suffer with it won't understand. People will say 'Oh, he must not be happy” or, 'oh, he's not really a submissive there is something wrong.   People don't understand that depression is a chemical imbalance. It's not just an emotional thing. Emotions are chemical driven. Synapses fire in parts of the brain, chemicals are released, and you feel a certain thing. When that's not functioning properly, you feel things that aren't rational.  I've been depressed all my life, and mostly no one's really ever understood that about me. I had a teacher in my old high school who would lurk in her classroom door until I was passing and lunge out at me and say 'SMILE'. I finally told her that I would smile when there was something to smile about. And that's just it. There's not always a reason to be smiling. I have a neutral zone, and that's where I generally wait. When something happens that deserves a smile, I smile. When something happens that deserves a frown, I frown. Then I go back to my neutral zone. People don't get that. This teacher certainly didn't get that. She was forever hounding me to smile. She even went so far as to keep me from getting the 'congeniality' award because I didn't smile 'enough'. Every other teacher in the school wanted me to have the award, and she was on the award council, and vetoed it, so I didn't get it. I didn't think one thing about it until someone told me she was the reason I didn't get it. Then I was pissed, and certainly didn't feel like smiling.   I meet a girl who was always smiling. Whenever you'd ask her how she was, she'd beam 'fantastic'. The thing was, she often told me that she always answered that way, no matter what. Said she felt if she said it enough, it would happen. But with people like that, I feel like you can't truly trust them to tell you the truth, about more than just how they feel. You know, when I ask someone how they are, I want an honest answer, just like I do when I ask someone if an outfit looks right on me. Maybe that's where I'm different from most people though. Maybe 'how are you' is just lip service for the majority of the world. I don’t give the honest answers either. I wish to and in person I will but the net you don’t really know them, and I assume I will leave the façade.   I've been hospitalized, but I've taken different medications over the years. Never anything for long term, simply because circumstances tended to prevent that from happening, but I've been in rough spots before.   I feel like I'm just venting right now, and it makes me feel a little guilty, but I'm mostly doing a free thinking/writing/typing thing, and just letting it come out. I think that's what I need right now anyway.  I've started to notice that I have a tendency to try to save the world when I need to be saved. It's weird. When things get hard for me, I guess I try to distract myself by trying to take care of everyone else who's having a hard time. It doesn't work for long though, and I usually go overboard and deplete myself more, which just results in me being a basketcase. I could have gotten a lot done in the house in those almost three hours but I didn’t. My day would have been a lot less hectic had I just not done it.",

My old friend Chris and I decided to go to the big Chicago premiere of Kill Bill, only we didn't have tickets.  Somehow we ran into a guy from my high school who had stacks of comp tickets he was giving away.  Chris, being the astute kinda guy he is, figured out the tickets were counterfit though.  My response, 'If they find out, they find out... but it's worth taking our chances.'  Soon after, I learned ticket holders would get to meet Quentin Tarantino before the film.  Now, I don't know any HUGE Tarantino fans, but my imagination created every type from handwritten t-shirt-clad teeny-boppers to film geeks with scraggly hair and tiny specs.  And not only was Quentin meeting his fans, but he was staging a seance' gone awry for groups of a dozen or so.  I finally got into the room where the seances were being staged and while waiting for the scene to reset itself, Quentin looks at my jacket and says, 'That's a good coat.  It's got that classic, vintage look... That's a great coat.'  I humbly say thank you and in the process notice he is wearing a pair of sneakers like the ones I own.  I point and say, 'Same shoes too.'  He laughs and points out we're like evil twins and all of a sudden he's shocked.  'Your shirt,' he says and goes to his bag and pulls out a book and holds it up to my chest to confirm this strange occurence.  I am wearing a Forlorn Funnies t-shirt, he has an issue of Forlorn Funnies.  'WHOA!' is what we both say, and I am about to suggest he make a movie of Forlorn Funnies when I realize I can use such a point to get a creative 'in' with Mr. Tarantino once we get a chance to talk more.  Well, in the back of the room is a fanboy type guy I went to college with, who is upset by the parrallels between me and the director.  He starts teasing me about how I'm taking the attention away from everyone else for no reason; he steps back and begins falling.  Quentin Tarantino, invoking Gene Wilders when a child falls into his river of chocolate, says matter-of-factly, 'Watch out.  This may be a fake seance, but that's a real bottomless pit with acid at the bottom.'  I wake up before flesh begins to be eaten away.  By the way, Kill Bill is loads of fun.  I'll keep anymore comments about it for the review and move on here in the blog.",

I think it had to do with the fact that your body changes every 7 years, and my time of change had come - just not the change I had expected.  You think your acne will go away along with your teenage years, but no, my acne got worse, the kind that are deep, painful, and leave red marks for weeks.  I was clueless on how to deal with it.  It wasn't a simple matter of hygiene or diet, it was infection and pain - both physiological and physical.  I tried Proactiv, toothpaste, neosporin, everything over the counter for a couple months and finally went to the gynecologist to see if the birth control pill could rid me of this hormonally linked problem.  I started on that, but no changes in my skin had taken place.  I graduated college a couple months later, and went home in the middle of winter depressed, but with an appointment to a dermatologist at the suggestion of my mom.  The derm prescribed me a oral antibiotic and 2 topicals.  I saw some results after 6 weeks, no more deep and painful lesions, but the persistent acne was still there.  I was still was so hopeless and alone.  I really don't think people know what persistent acne sufferers go through, unless they have had it themselves.  It has nothing to do with vanity.  It goes so much deeper than that.  Anyways, I came across a website called Acne.org which basically suggests a Benzoyl peroxide regimen.  Well, after regular visits to the site and further frustrations with the doctor's medicines, I tried the regimen.  Let me just say, it worked within a week.  It was my miracle.  My face is about 99% clear.  I don't know why I hadn't tried it earlier.  All I know now is that in some sort of odd way, I am thankful for my experience with acne.

We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.  We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.  We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added years to life not life to years. We've been  all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We've done larger things, but not better things.  We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.   These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete.   Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever. Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.  Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent.  Remember, to say, 'I love you' to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you.  Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again.  Give time to love, give time to speak, and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind. AND ALWAYS REMEMBER: Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.  If you don't send this to at least 8 people.... who cares? George Carlin",

Looking out the window, it was a bright and sunny day, This is the kind of weather for me, let me go and take a look, I opened the front door and something amazed me, I saw a reflection of me, it was where I have been, not where I wanted to be. The reflection lived life to destructively, a reflection of imperfection a life full of uncertainties. Go through this, and that and  the other, living life in the wrong way. Not knowing to keep on going, scared to live life day by day. Feeling sorry for what it has become, no longer caring for life's good things. Thinking death is the only way. Not knowing where to go, or what the next day brings. In a room of darkness deciding its on fate. With the knife in its hand, even more life it began to hate.

Do they even care, they don't even know what I'm going through. Minute after minute I kept on thinking, if I kill myself, what I sow is what I will reap. With the long sharp knife up to my wrist. I didn't care about me I wanted my life to be gone. When I was about to cut, ringing the phone did do, I thought my mom would answer, she thought I would too. I put down the knife and went to go answer the phone. The voice on the other end said I was about to hang up I didn't think you was home. With silence through the air this person knew something was wrong. What's the matter Martina, what's wrong with you? Nothing Nothing, it's not important. The person didn't say a thing, but still knew. Come on Martina your to quiet something is the matter, you can tell me. At this moment I wanted to be left alone, but this person I was talking to wouldn't get off the phone. Wanting to hang up I attempted to do, suddenly this person said I love you, and God does too. I found myself in tears because those words were to strong. I told this person, in a shacky voice, I need help, it feels like I don't belong. How so Martina, tell me I want to know. I can't tell you, I think I better go. Okay, Martina, if you want to talk, you know I'm always here. Approaching my room thinking about giving up, my end was coming near. Picking up the knife on my wrist I was ready to let it all go, but ringing in my head constantly thinking about what my friend had said, and that was God loves you too. Why did I allow myself to get here, what the person told me I already knew. Putting down the knife running to my mom I hugged her, she asked me what's the matter what happened to you? I couldn't do a thing but cry, she looked at me and said Martina you don't have to tell me, I know what you were going to do. I looked at her real strange, thinking no she doesn't, she's just saying that. She said Martina, you were going to kill yourself weren't you? How did you know that? She said baby, I know you, I know your upset about things, you can talk to me. I was thinking no I can't your not saved, besides I'm hurting spiritually.

I laid on my bed and started thinking about me. The next day I got up and thanked the Lord for letting me see another day, looking out the window, it was a bright and sunny day.

Under no circumstances use any other toilet than your own, regardless of any stomach pain may be caused whilst waiting to get home. \n2. With the toilet-brush, clean any residue left on the pan by your boyfriend / husband. Also wipe his pubic hair off the seat with some toilet paper. \n3. Flush the toilet before starting. Then wash your hands \n4. Line the toilet seat with toilet paper (as other people may have sat on the toilet since it was last bleached). \n5. Stuff toilet paper inside the pan to prevent splash-back. \n6. Pull panties down and sit. Some women may still prefer to squat over the seat as opposed to taking the risk of touching it with bare flesh. \n7. Release solids, but strain to avoid making any sounds. \n8. Rise and quickly flush before direct eye-contact is made with any faeces. \n9. Take a length of toilet paper and fold it several times to positively guarantee that no residue will touch bare skin (about five or six applications per roll). \n10. Wipe once and throw paper into the pan. Do not look at the paper. \n11. Repeat steps 9 and 10 at least thirty times. It may be necessary to yell for your boyfriend/husband to find some more rolls to pass through the door while promising not to open his eyes or pass any comments. It is traditional to do this while he is trying to watch sport. \n12. Flush the toilet and replace the lid. \n13. Wash hands at least three times with disinfectant soap. \n14. Open all windows and spray approximately half-a-can of air freshener. \n15. Pick up all reading material left behind by your boyfriend/husband and leave bathroom, closing the door firmly behind you. \n15 Easy Steps to Poo like a Man: \n1. Select reading material (can be anything except a porn-mag; tried by every man once, but never repeated - see step 4). \n2. Tell everyone along the way, 'Just going for a dump, okay?' Always tell girlfriend/wife, especially when she has visitors. \n3. Pull pants and trousers around ankles, then sit down. \n4. Adjust penis and testicles to hang comfortably without touching the toilet rim. \n5. Open reading material and relax. \n6. Whilst waiting, it is traditional to audibly fart. \n7. Sigh loudly as the first one bullets out. It is quite normal to experience a cold jet of water rocket up your anus as a result of the first bomb. This is to be endured if you want to be a real man. \n8. Remain sitting and reading until pins-and-needles set in to your legs and buttocks. \n9. Rise and look at the poo. Make mental notes of any irregularities to report to friends and girlfriend/wife, e.g. colour, consistency, any visible traces of peanuts, etc. You must tell people about it. \n10. Take long length of paper and wipe anus. You must look at the paper before throwing it into the pan. \n11. Repeat step 10 until there is no longer any evidence of faeces on the paper. \n12. Flush. If there is any residue left on the pan, under no circumstances attempt to clean it off. In due course, it will come away by itself. Or, when your girlfriend/wife next uses the loo. \n13.

        "blog_text": "I avoided getting a real job for years out of fear that it would make me miserable, despite having a degree from a top school and great promise. So instead I had a very fun but safe (no chance of getting fired) job that paid halfway decent money. I was wrong. The reason being I was already miserable to begin with. I would deny it to myself and everybody else around me. At times I would believe it. Last year I finally gave in. I finally put my degree to good use. I found a job in my field that pays very well, with the potential of growth. So instead of just being miserable, I'm miserable with money. I'm going to have a few drinks with co-workers after work today, then I'm going to have more drinks with friends tonight. I'll go out again tonight with high hopes of having a great time but halfway through I'll be drinking just trying to drown out the fact that I'm not. I go out with friends, I'll meet women hoping to find something that will fill this inner void. It's not sadness as it is utter boredom, or maybe a mixture of the two with some disillusionment thrown in. Finding happiness in the little things is difficult, to say the least. I don't feel as though I really have anything to say to anybody. The funny part is I end up saying a lot about nothing. By meeting me you would think I was the life of the party - I laugh, tell jokes, keep everybody entertained. Popularity or lack of friends or potential mates has never been an issue. It's finding joy in these things that has been the struggle. Like I said, you would never guess I feel this way. I don't talk about it much if at all because I know people don't want to hear it. Nobody wants to listen to that, it's depressing. The funny part is I feel that most people can relate to what I'm saying but nobody is brave enough to actually come and say it (myself included). Let alone hear it from someone else. So instead we all go out, put on costumes of fancy and we all stand around, posturing, canvassing the room trying to find something better that will break us from this funk. Or at the very least find some distraction so we can make it through this singular moment in hopes that the next one will be better, but it never does. We make out or take home some stranger to fill some immediate need only to feel empty the next day all over again. See, I realize something - it's not about that one moment where everything turns around. This dullness will continue even if all my material and social wishes come true. I will never be truly happy all the time with what I have. It's the search for something better that drives all of us forward. The second we are content we look for the next thing. Because as much as we hate to admit, we need something - a goal to keep us going. Basically, to give us meaning, a reason to keep living. We are defined by what we do, not who we are. So instead we cherish those fleeting moments of pure bliss. You know what I'm talking about - five seconds after you cum, eating ice cream on a hot summer day, a first kiss, winning, etc. Those few fleeting moments that we engrave in our mind to help us through the long extended periods of utter boredom. So this is my life. Every now and then I have these introspective moments of brilliance. Sometimes my cynicism gets the better of me, other times my hopeful optimism leads me down a road of disappointment or utter joy. I've learned to accept the world we live in. I'm trying to find happiness, fleeting as it is. Though the rebellious side of me every now and then tries to break free from this cycle only to be slapped down to reality. I'm sorry if this depresses you, but it's like I said, I have these moments. I really am a fun person, really.",

So when I asked Kelly about it she said he was there all ready both nights when she walked in.  When I asked Arlynd about Lora he confirmed the fact that he fucked her.  He cant seem to figure out why its my business.  Its like hello if you are fucking me and her damn right its my business.  I was also told by Tama that Kelly said I wanted her.  I told Tama that if I wanted her shed know it.  I then made an announcement to everyone in the bar that Brian was my boyfriend, just so there wasnt any confusion.

        "blog_text": "The title of this post is also the title of the song going through my head this morning. It's a song by Ladysmith Black Mambazo. It was one of those songs that I woke up with. But it's a pleasant song playing on my internal radio so no complaints at all. If you are so inclined to want to hear the song for yourself, There Is A Sample Here it's under the first CD featured, Shaka Zulu, ninth song. We had some major rain here in Butts county this past weekend. So much so that my vegetable garden took a major hit, there is some damage to the corn and beans, a few tomato cages were knocked over. I'm hoping for the best, believing that these plants want to live at least as much as I want them to. So with a little help from me they should do fine. The majority anyway. A friend of mine from Minnesota, where they have had great rainings here of late also, sent me an article she found in the Minnesota Gardening Forum that was a response to complainta about the rain. being that the forum is probably not read too widely outside it's state, I'd like to share the letter here. i think it's beautifully stated.    Be still. Listen. Breathe in... deeply. Feel the rain, Hear the rhythm of the drops. Put on a poncho, sit on a garden stool and experience the staccato of drops on the hood.  Get down and look closely at your plants. They will never be this green and healthy no matter how much water you pump over them. Nothing can equal the greening power of natural rain. Use your visionary powers to see beneath the mulch and soil. Their root systems are growing wider and deeper each day because the rain lubricates the spaces between the particles of earth, and the hair rootlets feel no resistance.   Gardening is more than a hobby, more than an activity. It is a release for our stress. It provides a vehicle by which we leave our artificial offices behind and achieve a reattachment to the earth. Take this imposed opportunity to connect at a slower pace.   Smell the air. Try to discern between humus, perfume , cut grass and wet rocks. Odors attach easily to humid air, and humid air easily attaches to our olfactory receptors, so you will be able to truly smell your garden.   Feel the textures. A thin layer of moisture allows our fingers to more easily slide over a leaf's surface, making the heavily ribbed rhubarb and the delicate touch of lamb's ears more pronounced.   Look at colors. To make wood more beautiful, we coat it with polyurethane. To make a photograph more realistic in the brochure, we print it on glossy paper. The 'wetness' of these treatments maximizes the color and intensity of details. So it is with your flowers if you will only look.   Finally, take off your shoes and socks and let your toes dig into moist bark, slide them through cool blades of grass, even (should we?) dunk them into mud puddles and squish the mud between your toes. Then stick them out straight and let the rain wash them off.   If you have trouble dealing with the fact that you can't get to all your projects, change the journey and make these things your projects. You will never look back and say, 'What a wasted day. All I did was relax!'   If none of this works, stand looking out the window, mentally bemoaning how inconvenient the rain is, and then go watch tv. It will keep your mind off of all the things you 'should' be accomplishing.   Mark   Here's a Bit About The writer",

'...even before cookin u could have called me for a second n told me 'hey, i just got back... i can't really talk much right now.. i'll call as soon as i'm free.. hug' - even that much would have been great. but no. nothing.  then i did the assinine thing of mentioning Mr.N. ...last time i was stuck in an hospital he was so  THERE  for me.. i go...

K made me feel much, much, MUCH more special then N could ever hope to! (infact N knew K was much closer to me... n had to live with that fact) i miss being important enough to him to sit outside movie halls in the heat of the middle east when his friends were watch movies in air-conditioned halls...so that he could save up the money his dad had given him to buy me luxuries of life like cool waters! - cause i didn't want him wastin his dad's money on me! -  money i've saved is like money i've earned right?! he was supposed to come over the next day (23 sun) since he wasn't able to make it on 22... n i'd make a sarci remark saying 'i dunno whether you'll want to come.. i'm not going to be much fun... n i'm deffinately not comin for a movie or italian food!' ...he is   really sweet   and doesn't take umbrage and says 'just tell me which hospital... i'll be there'  after the message where he told me he hates me, he neither messaged nor called. forget come n see me & ma. ma... he used to call her mom(amma actually) ...he used to tell me even if nothing worked out between us he'd still consider my parents as his own!! he n ma were(are? cause she is not the least bit upset with him! to her, he is still her   'son'  ) pretty close...n she was in a hospital for a serious operation... he doesn't even bother to check on her!forget help her.. not even a courtesy call... nothing.  my younger sis (not blood relation) who is his younger sis too.. speak with him n he tells her 'no i'm not calling her. i'm always going to be second best to her. i can never compare to N'  no messages, no calls, no nothing. for all appearance it looks like he couldn't give a damn whether i was alive or dead!!   then on 27th may (or LATE 26th - 1:30 at night) he sends me a msg saying 'i'm sorry for being so insensitive at this point in time.. i'm sorry i hurt you so much.. i'm sorry i'm being a jerk.. i'm sorry i'm not there for you, with you'  ...i honestly dunno what to say.

(cause i just KNOW you are going to read this sometime. had actually written one of them letterz that i write but never give you..)  he used to keep harping on N when we were talking n i'd told him atleast a gazillion times, he means  more  to me then N   ever   did. then  any friend  ever did. then  anyone   ever  did.  is missing someone other then him a crime? how many times have i been there for him when he was missin someone else? why does he assume he is capable of caring about more then one person, but i am not? why is it a number game? why do i have to constantly prove he is important to me? why, WHY,   WHY  , is he ready to abandon me at the slightest/trivialest excuse? despite   PROMISING   me he won't?  why do i mean so little to him despite his claim that i'm his whole world? why will he not believe me when i say he means more to me then N ever did or will, when i've _NEVER_ ever lied? why can't he be the sorts who says to himself 'ok, she misses N?..he made her feel special by being there for her over long distance phone?? well, i'm here in person i'm going to be so   THERE    for her that when ever she is upset/in need, she will think of only me!!' why can he NEVER, ever, swallow his ego n foolish pride n be the first to call up... especially since he is the one who is always leaving!? why can't he be the sorts to get me a big bunch of flowers n turn up at my doorstep n say 'SUPRISE!' why can't his words translate into actions? why, WHY, does he say he can't live without me... n then go on to prove what a big whopper that is!? he has changed his pwds again. he has broken his promise to me bout NEVER smoking again, no matter what.    why can he not see he made me feel much, much, MUCH more special then N could ever hope to!   why can he live happily without me?  why can i not live without him?  it sure doesn't feel like i can.  one of my best friends from school came over today (for like one hour! she travelled for atleast 3 hours to be able to be able to spend that one hour with me!)...n though she had come over to see ma 99% of the time was spent locked up in my room discussing this (one look at me n she tried to force feed me... i couldn't keep it down n threw up) she asked me why won't i call up.. each time he LEAVES me, i call up.. i'm beginning to feel like i'm forcing myself on him. if he wants to leave me so badly that he is cooking up reasons then maybe i should give him his freedom eh? ...maybe its not that... maybe he just didn't want to give me his laptop for a whole month?? ....maybe...ummm...maybe it has a lil something to do with the way i look? he once told me 'i want u to join VLCC (a sliming clinic) before my parents meet u (his parents have NEVER met me)' ...n i haven't lost any weight. if anything i've put on some more.  maybe he is just embrassed by me and his leaving me  YET    AGAIN   is my punishment for not losing weight? this hurts more,way   MORE  , then the notion bout him being jealous over N, but is more logical. n he knows i need to find logic in everything.  and..    why can he not see he made me feel much, much, MUCH more special then N could ever hope to!    there is a song which says it all for me  'Nothing compares... nothing compares....i said nothing compares to   you  '",

They took away my personality and randomness. But they made me feel secure. I knew I wasnt but they allowed me to at least feel like it. I know I have a damn easy life compared to many people, but I cant take it.   Ive come to the point where any little stress makes me freak out. For example, I started crying this evening after I realized that the lady who made my sub at Nicks they have the best subs put mayonnaise on what could have been an amazingly awesome turkey sub.  I cried over mayonnaise on a sub.  Everything makes me want to cry. I was just reading an email. It was an ad for some snowboarding website, but I didnt understand exactly what it was trying to get at. So I nearly cried.  I didnt cry at my grandmothers funeral last week, but I almost cried over an advertisement in an email.  Im pathetic.  Anyway. Tonight after rehearsal for the student directed one-acts-- I got a fairly decent part. Yay, I had planned on getting a delicious sub at Nicks and eat it while watching  Young Frankenstein  Dillon let me borrow the DVD today. I was so excited. The day had been going great. I aced my monologue for my Theatre3 exam, and rehearsal went dandy. Everything was just hunky-dory. Mom took me to Nicks I got a sub and couldnt wait to get home. Once I was home, I sat down with sub took a few bites, then realized there was mayo on it. Why cant people just learn how to make a sandwich without putting mayonnaise on it. Its not that hard.  Even  I  can do it. RAAAGGHHH. So.I could deal with that. I had some tortilini left over from dinner last night that I could eat. So.. I went to get the DVD player to move it from the living room into the family room, where I am whenever I am not at school. The case for  The Pianist  was laying in front of the DVD player, so I, of course I figure it was in there. I opened the DVD player and didnt see it. Pissed, I continued to unhook the cables to move it into another room. .Later, I was asking mom where the  The Pianist  DVD was, and I opened the DVD player again to show her it wasnt in there. Not there. I closed it and heard what sounded like the tray that the DVD goes on hitting something as it closed.like a DVD. Bah... Anyway... the disc is somehow now stuck in the DVD player, so they are both probably broken now. So that screwed up my other plan for the evening. Then, like icing on the cake, Bill, my moms boyfriend and the biggest asshole in the world comes in. I am of course still having a fit over the sub, the DVD player, and all the other shit that has gone wrong, and how worthless I am in general. And he is making fucking smart-ass comments after every thing I say, which, pisses me off even more. I stand up, yell at him to shut the fuck up to which he makes even more fucking smart-ass comments. At this point, I cant take it any longer, so I do the only thing that ever comes remotely close to making me feel better... I pick something up, throw it around hoping that I will break something. .I didnt break anything  I just caused Bill to yell at mom because she needs to stop giving in to me or some bullshit like that. did she do anything to give into me tonight no. well, except maybe by buying me food and by not yelling at me like everyone else when I start crying.... fucking bastard... where the hell did that get that fucking idea of giving in. he needs to get his fucking head out of his ass once in awhile. Its hard to understand someone when his speech is almost unintelligible because of the disgustingly thick hick accent and every other word is fuck or fucking or motherfucking or motherfucker... And Im always the one who gets yelling at for cussing...  ...So many fucking double-standards...  ..How I would love to have killed him right then and there......  ...I guarantee that if I live to be 30, Ill be in jail... probably for murder or attempted murder... so maybe people piss me off and just keep pushing me and pushing me and fucking pushing me..... I fucking try to warn them to stop, but no one fucking understands... The only way I can really express my anger is phyiscally, and I only can hold it in so long....  ...God I sound like a fucking psychopath... .....At that point, I was thinking of every possible way to seriously injure/kill myself... They only good ideas I came up with were jumping through the huge window in the family room where I was it was on the first floor, so there wouldnt be a fall, kbut Im sure the glass would put a hell of a hurting on me or crashing a car going really fast into a bunch of trees... The only problem with that was I didnt have a car. But, if I did, I dont honestly know if Id be typing this now, or if I would now or one with a tree....  ...Im sorry to everyone I know that is reading this.... Im sorry you had to read this... Well, you didnt  have to  read this, you did it completely under your own free-will... But still, Im sorry....  Lately nothing has seemed fun or interesting...  I went snowboarding on Friday, and anyone who knows me knows that I love snowboarding... Did I have fun ...No, it was boring... I hated it... For most of the evening, Luke and I hung out in the lodge and the store where Joanna was working...  Not even music is appealing to me... It feels pointless to me... ...bah, I dont know how I feel... The only thing that has interested me lately is reading... I guess because it allows me to escape this place and become enthralled in another world. In books, there isnt anyone telling me that I am wasting my potential, that I am a slacker although that is completely true, there is no one nagging me about my grades hey, Im making better grades than my brothers ever did..., or doing any other fucking thing to piss me off... And, what is so great about books is that, if something does piss me off in them, I can stop reading them... And, voila, nothing pissing me off...   I have such a strong urge to go back to using drugs, they were such a relief... such an escape... For just a couple hours I could forget about all the problems and all the bullshit... God, that was so nice.... ...Im not talking drugs like pot, because smoking is disgusting... Ive been craving morphine lately... I dont whether it is because of the fact that I used to be addicted to its little brother, codiene, or because I know I could easily overdose.... either way...  ...Im sorry that this post is so long...",

See, I tried to do it, and boy did he object.  I tried to tell him, 'Man, you just don't see what's out there.  There's cars, and motorcycles, and cement mixers, and they don't know you're blind!  They just go flying by on that street, and they don't care if they make an oil smear out of you on the highway.'    That's when he really got mad.  He told me that I just didn't understand, he said.  He's not blind, he said, and for me to leave him alone and let him do it himself.  Okay, I said, go right ahead and step off that curb there and see if you can make it to the median of the highway.  Then we'll talk.  Well, he got out there in the road, and got clipped by one guy's mirror, and then (I watched all this with my hands over my eyes, but I had to peek out now and then - it was just mortal fear and curiosity, I tell you) and then another truck came by and it just missed him, and then - well, then, he gets rolled by another car and I thought that's it, a Moped is going to come by and do this guy in.  So now he's on the median, right?  And I KNOW he needs help, so I yell to him, HEY GUY!  Don't move, let me help you out.  Let me come to you and we will get over to the other side just fine together.  He shooed me away and scampered out into the oncoming traffic, dancing in and out of the oncoming cars, still demanding, increasingly loudly, 'I can do this just fine by myself, Mom, if you would just FUCK OFF!'    So here I am, hands tied, on one side of the road, while Chris is on the median of the highway, with this truck coming at him (bad grades - will he graduate?) a big tank-like SUV (with GWB and Cheney and Wolfie at the wheel, lobbing grenades) headed for him too (If he joins the military, like he says he wants to, will I be placing a flag in a triangle shaped box over my mantle sometime, instead of pictures of grandkids?), then there's the flock of smaller vehicles that's in his path and headed for him:  bicycles, mopeds, possibly a solar powered car - that would be STD's, now that he's sexually active...and none of these dangers are real to him.  None of them can  possibly  hit him, according to his views, because he's...oh, I don't know, sixteen and invincible, perhaps?    In my southern lit class, we read a poem today called 'The Lost Children' by Randall Jarrell.  As I am currently suffering from senioritis, I planned to read the poem before we discussed it (i.e., during the lecture...) and as I was sitting there, reading this little gem of a poem, while concurrently worrying about my own little lost lamb who cannot seem to get his crap together on a bet, I am overcome.  I mean, this showed the possibility of being on par with the giant gusher nosebleed I got during my final Spanish test.  I could feel it coming - I was going to cry.  And I mean CRY.  The poem is bad enough, but couple it with worry for your own child (who is, strictly speaking, no longer technically a child and a real stout hollering distance from being the baby with beautiful blond curls and sweet kiss) and you have a real recipe for hankie-needin':   The Lost Children   Two little girls, one fair, one dark, One alive, one dead, are running hand in hand Through a sunny house.  The two are dressed  In red and white gingham, with puffed sleeves and sashes. They run away from me...But I am happy; When I wake I feel no sadness, only delight. I've seen them again, and I am comforted That, somewhere, they still are.  It is strange To carry inside you someone else's body; To know it before it's born; To see at last that it's a boy or girl, and perfect; To bathe it and dress it; to watch it Nurse at your breast, till you almost know it Better than you know yourself - better than it knows itself. You own it as you made it. You are the authority upon it.  But as the child learns to take care of herself, you know her less. Her accidents, adventures are her own, You lose track of them.  Still, you know more  About her than anyone  except  her.  Little by little the child in her dies. You say, 'I have lost a child, but gained a friend.' You feel yourself gradually discarded. She argues with you or ignores you Or is kind to you.  She who begged to follow you Anywhere, just so long as it was you, finds follow the leader no more fun. She makes few demands; you are grateful for the few.    That's only the first little bit of it, but I have to say, I'm really glad we didn't get a chance to discuss it in class.  My teacher probably thinks that I was overly moved by the poem he was reading at the time I read this one (I read really fast, and the first poem - four lines - was devoured before the page was all the way open).    Labor and delivery was fun!  Ear infections were a breeze!  Let's go back to the days of yore when he would scream, cry, wail and cling to my raincoat when I tried to leave him in second grade!  Day after day, without fail, I would come to work wrung out, because he WOULDN'T LET GO OF MY ARM!  And now, (suddenly - it's suddenly, I tell you, there's no other way to describe it but gutwrenchingly urgently sudden)  I'm  supposed to let go of  him ?  In the middle of the  ROAD ?",

Daddad grew up in San Antonio, Texas with his parents and his four siblings : Olive, Claude, Dorothy, and James.  All of them have passed away.  He had a very accident-filled childhood.  For example:  he was nearly scalped when he got in a bicycle accident.  They took him to the pharmacist who poured peroxide on his skull while sitting at the soda counter.  There was also the time his brother was swinging around a box of dirt on a rope (who knows why- it was the 1920s?!) and when their father told him to quit it he just let go and it smacked Daddad in the head.  Then one time he was riding on the outside of a Model T, headed to play football with some friends, when the car tipped and fell on top of him.  They just erected it, played football, then Daddad got his leg checked out.  His father died about a month before the depression, but luckily left coins in the safety deposit box.  My great-grandmother Georgia did people's laundry, Daddad worked, and they took out some coins each month.  He worked at an ice-cream factory for awhile, which is appropriate considering he is one of the biggest chocolate fiends I have ever met!  I used to open cabinets in his kitchen and find them lined with one-pound Hershey bars!  Part of that is he still has a depression mentality (the man saves everything), but mostly it's because he eats unearthly amounts of chocolate!  Anyway...Georgia died young as well.  My Daddad always gets teary-eyed when he talks about how she had to cut her hair (it was red and when it was down, trailed behind her on the ground!) because it caused too much pain.  So, Daddad moved to Kansas City due to his job and met my Mama, Marjorie Jane Benton.  He spotted her having a soda with some friends after a bible class, strolled up, swung one of his long legs over a chair, sitting in it backwards, and said, 'Howdy girls, my name is Tex.'  He asked her out soon after, and thirteen days after their first date, they were engaged.  They got married a few months after that.  Daddad left to fight in World War II.  He was in the military police and saw lots of things in Europe, and met some very interesting people.  My mother was born while he was away...he did not see her until she was seven or so months old.  When he returned, he worked for the IRS investigating people who wanted to work for the IRS.  This is why he is a notorious questioner of everything!  He has never tasted coffee in his life, though he enjoys a nice, cold Coke.  He hasn't had a drink since Mama got sick.  She, and in turn he, were very social people in their day.  Never been a smoker.  Has had some fairly major health problems, but is still going.  He gets sad that he can't recall things well...he is a story-teller, so it hurts extra.  He has traveled the world - Europe, both during the war and later on with Mama, Africa, Mexico, the U.S.  They were planning to go to Australia, but then she got sick...There is so much more...  Daddad has instilled in me a love of family- living and past, history, collecting (you should see his stamp collection!), not to be too extravagent and to share what you have, work hard, be educated,and so much more.  I realize that this could be his last birthday...that's why I knew I had to fly home.  He and I are very close...he told my Mom, 'I can't believe she is coming just for me!'  He is my last grandparent.  They were all so important to me, and I can't bear to think of having to let go again, but I know that's how things go.  I don't think he's scared and I am not for him, or for what I will feel.  But...this is a celebration of someone who is luckily still here despite all those head traumas at a young age!  Here's to you Daddad! (even though he won't read this...he's not into computers) Happy Birthday and I will see you on Saturday.  I love you.  xoxo",

        "blog_text": "It all started when I called Lauren. There's this guy that I have liked for a while, and I think that he might like one of my friends. I have this (guy) friend who likes this friend... a lot. And I was thinking that if the guy that I like asks my friend out, she would say yes without a doubt. And it would hurt me a lot. So when I called Lauren, I was really angry because it made me upset how someone could just do something without thinking of their actions. But when I got on the phone with Lauren, I started crying, because I realized that I wasn't angry, but I was  upset . Of course I would be upset over the fact that the guy I like for a while would be going out with my girl friend, but I was crying over the fact of how hurt my guy friend would be. I don't even care how hurt I get anymore. I hate seeing other people so sad. Especially one of my friends. My guy friend just likes my girl friend so, so much. And I hate the fact that my friend doesn't even consider how she makes other people feel. So I got off the phone with Lauren and I was sitting in my chair, crying and thinking. And it made me realize that sometimes  I  do things without considering how other people feel. And how I haven't been exactly the nicest person in the world sometimes. Then I started thinking about other things, and my mind just became a whole swirling jumble of mess. I started crying even more. Like, how could I regret giving my mom $1500 so she could have a chance at being an actual citizen and seeing her family again? I feel so guilty for actually regretting that. She deserved that money, and now I'm really glad I did that. She might be able to go back this summer and see her entire family again. It would be the first time in over 20 years. I really hope she'll be able to. Also, I used to do this 'Random Acts/Compliments Of Kindness' thing with Lauren... I would give out compliments or do nice little deeds for people that I don't normally talk to. And I would list what I did daily and stick it in Lauren's locker. How could I just give up doing that after 2 weeks? How selfish am I? I mean, how much does it take to talk to a person who's sitting all alone in class or to compliment someone you usually don't bother talking to in class? Sure, it may take a little effort being nicer, but it may really make someone's day one day. I felt really disappointed in myself. How could I be so hypocritical? How could I be upset over my friend not thinking of her actions when I don't feel upset when I don't think before I act myself? I just wish I could turn back about 6 years of my life and relive it. How could I have been so mean in the past? And why have I been? After all this, I don't care if the guy I like likes my friend anymore. I just don't want my friend going out with him because I don't want to see my (guy) friend get hurt. My feelings have been all wavy today. First, I was acting really happy, oblivious to what was going on. Then I was angry, and then I was sad. And now I'm just... I don't know anymore. But I just read over this blog and I sound so emo. I'll probably change my mind after I publish this blog and delete it... so you're lucky if you get a chance to read this.",

        "blog_text": "I can't really explain it but I really feel the 'The Fear' lately. It seems like there are a lot of terrible things, lots of tragedy going on around me right now. An unusual amount of sadness and heartache and I have an overwhelming sense of uneasiness. I heard that a friend's Father has retired because he's 'not going to make it'. His retirement was rushed through. I find this alarming because although I knew that her Father is ill with cancer, she has not spoke of it, nor did she ever allude to the fact that he is so bad. We found out he retired from a co-worker and not from my friends. I wonder if my friend is just in denial and has convinced herself that her Father is not that sick, that he is going to make it. This is the worst frame of mind to have because if he does pass away it's going to make it that much harder for her to deal with his death. My friend has been having medical problems and problems at work. Her daughter's fiance was in a serious accident and is in a coma, if he does make it, he will likely have sever brain damage and have to learn to walk and talk again. Her boyfriend's step mother has been given only months to live, and now her children's grandmother on their father's side has been put on nitro and it doesn't look like she is going to make it either. My supervisor and his wife just had their first child. A healthy 8 pound girl with lots of curly dark hair. We just found out today that the child is having complications now with it's lungs and blood pressure and is at Primary Children's Hospital. I have a very serious suspicion that my job is in danger. This could be my increasing paranoia, but something is up. Something is not right and I really feel as though I could lose my job out of no where. This really perplexes me as I could pass a drug test should I be given one, I do my work and my percentage collected has been excellent. I'm getting my hours in and I know that I'm not doing anything personally that could cause me to lose my job yet somehow I have a weird feeling that it is in fact in jeopardy. It could be that I just don't fit in and I'm not well received or like around the office and the vibe is just getting to me. It could be the new changes that will be implemented soon, they are building new offices over in the warehouse and the rumor is our department will be moving over there. A friend's wife is also sick, she is young and should not be so sick. They really don't seem to know what exactly is wrong with her and I fear with out health insurance it could be too late before she gets properly diagnosed and treated. I can't help but feel scared for some reason. Out of no where I will all of a sudden be paralyzed by fear, terrified that something horrible is going to happen to one of my loved ones. I'm afraid to travel, we are flying to LA Friday the 13th to go to an art exhibit we've been interested in seeing and staying at the Marriott in downtown LA. As I get older flying becomes more difficult for me as with every little bump of turbulence I can't help but picture the plane dropping out of the sky and careening towards the Earth to our death. And no, it doesn't fucking help that we're flying on Friday the 13th. I find myself being worried about my relationships. I worry that my close friends are 'mad' at me, I worry that all of a sudden my husband will leave me, I question if my parents really love me or not. I'm so scared, so terrified that my life is all of a sudden going to rip apart at the seams and fall apart. That my luck has run out, that karma is catching up to me, that the feeling I don't deserve all these blessings, all these wonderful friends, family, my loving husband... I feel like it's all going to be taken away from me with a catastrophic event. And you thought you were paranoid. Jesus Christ, is this the beginning of some kind of psychotic episode? Will I soon convenience myself that my neighbors are Alkihda members and be staked out in my back yard with my 9mm and night vision? Will I barricade myself in my home and not leave for fear that 'something bad' might happen if I leave the house? Will I hold my husband hostage for the same reason...  my precious .... The fear is strong these days, I will be greatly relieved when this feeling subsides. In the meantime I'm going to be doing a lot of Yoga, hot tub chillin, and heavy meditation. I need to stop assuming the worst and getting strange visions of horrible things happening to my loved ones, it's bad mojo. Fight the Fear! Woo!",

Most of them hardly use or are even aware of them anyway. We'll start with that pesky 8th Amendment. Capital punishment for capital crimes I say. Heck, they don't even need to be capital crimes. Littering should be made punishable by public burning at the stake. That'll make the streets cleaner. Like Singapore. Why can't we all be like Singapore? It's so clean. And efficient.  See? Already things are better. Clean streets, more parking (no more need for street cleanings) and public executions to keep our nation's youth from staying in the house and rotting their brains on violent television. Hate those people who close the elevator on you? Well, that could be made punishable by being strapped into a chair and being forced to watch reruns of teletubbies for the rest of eternity. I'm not even breaking the current standing 8th Amendment  that  much. A punishment isn't unusual until after the first few hundred times, and cruel is a very subjective word.

Perhaps we ought not go as far as to create a totalitarian regime every decade or so, but instead have an annual, two week-long 'Totalitarian Fest' in which every citizen of the U.S. lives in a gulag type camp.

I tried to post about 2 weeks ago, but my blog want accessible for a few days because of some error or something, and then I had to leave for Daytona Beach.  That is a whole nother story, and Im sure Ill post that later today when I have more time.  However, I apologize for not being here.  Now that im home, I have a ton of stuff to do.  Namely getting back in shape and spending quality time with Maggie, and also my girlfriend (who came in and jumped on me at 9:00 this morning).  I also need to do a little updating here, which is fine.    Anyways, this post is about our youth director, Brian Loper.  Brian has been at our church for I think a little less than 2 years.  However, he is leaving now.    When I was in the 6th grade, we had a youth leader named John Hauser.  John was the man, and everyone really loved him a lot.  He was an excellent speaker and story teller, and an awesome Christian.  He ineracted with all of the youth, and everyone got along very well with him.  Bible studies were jammed pack full of people and we had the youth room packed every Sunday night and Sunday mornings to hear him speak to us.  One day he came to us at youth, and said that he had recived a message from God, and had to leave our church to go to a tiny little town in Iowa.  He claimed that God had come to him and given him a vision while he was praying one day and it told him that he needed to move on.  I later found out he was asked to leave by the members and pastors of our church because of several large disagreements between them and him.  That was about 4 years later though.    After John left, we kinda went into a dead zone.  Parents of our church tried to take over, and they also said we could be in charge of ourselves. This was an excellent idea.  One sunday night a month, we would meet in seperate groups with a few parents and discuss plans we had for the future of our youth ministries.  There were tons and tons of awesome ideas and the adults were pretty pleased.  However, because we were being run by volunteers, and could not do anything on our own without the church's permission or adult help, all of that fell through and nothing happened.  Youth was pretty much pointless, just silly games and a bunch of messes.  A lot of people stopped comming.  This lasted about a year.  We really needed a youth director.  So, the church hired Kathy Maston.  Kathy was newly married, and pretty much straight out of school.  I hate to be sexist, but women youth directors are lousy.  Guys can play games, such as basketball and football, with everyone, and get along with guys and gals, where Kathy just wanted to watch G rated movies with the middle school girls.  Instead of doing stuff our age, Kathy acted like she was running a day care service.  We painted all of the walls in our youth room bright neon colors, which to me, and most of everyone, looked like a club for homosexuals.  Every Sunday night, we had youth, and it was pointless beyond extreme.  Instead of getting up and talking to us about God and Jesus, we would play retarded games and sing the same 3 songs every night.  Needless to say, we pretty much lost almost our entire youth group during this period.  One day, some of us went to a seminar for youth about how to bring in and attract our friends to join us at our church every Sunday night.  There was about 15 of us, and 3 adults.  As we were eating our dinner out on the lawn of the college we were at, one of the adults got a call from someone at the Church.  Kathy had packed up all of her stuff and just left without letting anyone know.  2 years later we were told she was fired.  She was there for 7 months.  So again, we were back into a dark black pit which seemed impossible to get out of.  The parents while sometimes annoying, kept the youth at our church alive with retreats and special events.  Without their help, we would not be where we are today.  However, they were all volunteers, and asked for a long term youth director that would stay and guide us.  So we bagan hiring.  Meanwhile, we were still trying to recover from the after shocks of the Kathy era, and were really struggling.  There was two people at bible study.  Me and Dylan Ayuso, led by Jeff Livingood.  By far the best Bible Studies I have ever been to.  Im very thankful for Jeff's time and effort, even though he had a small audience.  We needed more though, and we needed to get back to where we were 3 years ago.  So we set up this thing called a leadership team.  I was voted onto it somehow, even though im not exactly popular and well known in our youth.  It went well, and we set up dates and plans and stuff for everything.  Things were looking a tad better.  Then the car accident happened.  Wes and Andy Burton, and Ryan Shoaf we all killed.  This tragedy brought our group together and gave us new confidence and reliability.  We were hurting, but we had each other, and that helped more than anything.  I was so happy to see everything looking great.  I was afraid that it wasnt going to last, but to my suprise for awhile, everything was going smoothly.  Our attendence numbers went up and people began to come more.  Thats when Brian showed up.  I wont go into detail of how we got Brian, because I dont know everything, and I dont want to guess.  Anyways, Brian came to our group in the middle of our mourning, and worked with it to help everyone become better christians and bring in more members.  Immediatly, people started to come back.  However, do to the repurcussions of past youth issues, there was a lot of senior high folk still absent.  I had just gotten into my freshman year, and there was not a whole lot of juniors or seniors who came.  This was tough on Brian, but we worked through it.  In most aspects, Brian helped out youth group grow.  We re-did our youth room, brought in new members, and helped everyone grow in faith.  The retreats were exceptionally good, and a whole lot more fun.  We had more involvement and activities besides on Sunday night.  There was basketball in the gym, picnics, and parties at peoples homes, and fun activities.  Youth took a turn for the better.  Brian had great games to play, and everyone had a good time on Sunday nights.  Everything went great for awhile.  Brian was an excellent speaker, and he made me realize a lot of things I would have never known.  He gave us more songs to sing, and brought us together a little through worship.  But not all he did was good.  He still kept the Youth Leadship Team, and promised us that he would use us.  However, at every meeting, we would have ideas, and they almost never went into effect.  Over time, there were never meetings, and nothing happened.  In my opinion, he could have really used us to help, but never did.  I thought we had a lot to offer.  Our youth group was pretty much broken up into small groups who hung out with only each other.  It was basically our way of survivng through the tough times.  Brian taught us that we needed to break this habit and reach out to other members and get to know everyone.  However, he didnt really live this himself.  About 15 or so senior high guys and girls became extremly close with him, very very close.  So close that he didnt really interact with most other people.  I knew he was trying, but he wasnt doing much.  I was not one of these close people.  A lot of my friends were, and we grew apart because of this.  The 'inner group' would constantly hang out with one another and do things, a lot of it with Brian (a lot not also, but they had the bond that Brian had brought them closer.  This still goes on today).  I was kinda left out, and was never informed of these social meetings and events and grew away from it all.  I wasnt the only one who went through this, and attendence went down again, mainly because people felt excluded from everything that happened.  Thats really not fun.  Communication was poor, and basically these main people were the youth group.  I still did a few things with the guys, but it was really awkward.  They would be telling stories about the awesome things they had done the week before at someones house with Brian or just with themselves and the other 'inner' people.  They would be like 'man Adam, you should have been there.'  I would just kinda stand there and listen thinking 'yeah, I was home that night, you could have called me, I was bored out of my mind.'  This caused me to kinda quit for a month or two.  It just wasnt fun anymore.  I didnt have anyone to really hang out with at youth, and a lot of the senior high girls for some reason didnt like me much, which left me even more secluded.  All of this is still going on, and getting worse, but I dont really care anymore.  Another thing I was really disappointed in was his lack of understanding he needed a little help.  When he first came, there was about 12 adults who always came and helped out every Sunday night.  Brian pretty much told all the parents he would not be needing them anymore, and he would hand select the ones he did want to help.  At the time, I was glad he did this.  I was a little sick of all the adults being around at our services and stuff trying to be all cool.  Only now am I aware of how much they really helped us.  Most of the people he chose, he chose because he knew them, and knew what they had to offer.  The others he just tossed to the side, and im sure they weren't pleased at all.  When he wasnt there, the parents really held us together.  They did their best, even if it wasnt what we wanted.  It was all they could do.  When Brian came, it was great to see a few go.  But now I really know how much they could have helped him, and how much we needed them.  Dont get me wrong, I was glad to see some go, and am still glad they are gone, but i also wish we had some of them back, and some of the ones he kept would go away.  Brian was always really stressed out about stuff, and some of them could have really helped if he had asked Im sure.  Im not sure if Brian was aware of this or not, but a lot of the adults really disagreed with some of the things he did, and were also upset about him cutting them loose.  This might have saved him some trouble down the road.  The church is the people, not the people who run it.  Brian also did not have any time for anyone.  This, I cannot blame him for at all, as it is not his fault.  He had a young family.  A family he needed to take care of.  I could never get mad at him for trying to spend time with his kids and wife instead of us.  I also got really pissed off at the church for dragging him into more than he could handle.  Not only did he have to do stuff with our youth group, but he had to preach on some Sundays to the church, and do certain tasks which I thought were a little to needy.  Our church really asked to much from him.  In return, he didnt really get what he wanted.  When we were trying to re-do our youth room, the church refused 80% of the things we had in mind, and didnt really give us a whole lot of money.  This was unfair.  Now Brian is going to a new church, right on a beach in a little paradise, with a youth room twice the size of ours, and 2 stories tall.  Not only that, but he can pretty much do whatever he wants to do with it.  Wonder why he is going?  We really took him for granted.  On a personal note, I have never really had any type of relationship with him at all.  Me and him have never had a chance to sit down and talk about things, and spend time together like a normal youth pastor would.  Tons of other kids got his time, but not me.  I felt shoved to the side.  One time, before the fall retreat, he came to me after youth and asked if I wanted to go to dinner with him one night.  I said sure, and he told me to call him.  Every night that week, I called his house leaving messages on the phone, and with Katherine Hupert once (who was babysitting his kids), telling him I was available whenever.  I went to his office once only to find him in a deep conversation with Stu and Drew, and I still left him a message on his door.  Not only did he not return any of my calls, but he didnt even speak to me for 3 more weeks.  That was beat up.  I didnt get mad at first because I know he was very busy, but when I learned he had taken other people to dinner, or had conversations with people, I felt very dissed.  It was like I wasnt as important as other youth.  The amount of work and involvement I had put into this group during the bad times and even when Brian was there seemed to amount to nothing.  About 2 months later, I really needed someone to talk to, so I called him up.  Left a message at his house, and at his office twice that week.  No returned calls.  So i gave up.  No use in involving myself in anything that had no respect for the time and effort I had put into it.  I still couldnt find myself to blame Brian.  Youth had gone downhill, and not only for me, but for a lot of other people who just wouldnt come anymore.  And that is where we are now.  Brian is leaving to go to a really nice church, where he has a lot of control, and we are again left leaderless and in the dirt.  I have just gotten back from an awesome worship experience in Daytona.  I went down early, with Scott and Cole, London, and the Herndons.  We had a pretty good time.  I went to work, and no play, so thats what i did.  The whole trip Brian was extremly stressed and pissy.  I cant blame him, but it really has not improved my opinion of him at all.  Brian is an awesome guy, christian, and leader that I have looked up to for help the past two years.  While recieving no recgonition for a lot of things from him, I have learned so much and will never forget the lessons he has taught me.  Hes patient and giving.  He did so much good for our youth group, it will be hard to replace him now.  Nearly impossible.  Still, he is leaving our youth group in shambles, with no new youth director on the radar, with an unfinished youth room, and a lot of angry kids and adults.  And yet, how can you blame him for leaving us?  Hes going to a beautiful town in Georgia, near all of his friends.  To an awesome church, that is giving him practically everything he needs.  His youth group is just a tad smaller, but probably more manageable.  He is starting fresh again, with more resources avaiable and im sure a little bit more support.  As far as pay goes, I dont know, but I have a inkling its a bit more if not the same.  Hes leaving a church that has been unsupportive and uncooperative to his requests, and does not give him the respect he deserves.  Im all tied up.  I wish he wouldnt leave for the youth group, but I dont have an urge to stop him.  Ive given up on ever getting anything done with our church.  I feel its time to move on, but I cant bring myself to do it.  To many memories I guess.  While at Daytona, my brother had an awesome idea.  Maybe we can start our own youth type program by ourselves.  That isnt run by the church, but by us.  A very very cool idea.  However, after thinking about it, it isnt fesible.  We dont have a place to meet at, and if its away from the church, we cant meet there.  We also dont have money to fund things, and its doubtful we ever will.  If its going to be run by us high school guys, you know there are going to be tons and tons of disagreements, problems, and issues that happen.  Every few years, we lose a leader and basically have to start over again.  We wont have a speaker or teacher every time we meet for inspiration either.  Ive got a feeling that its going to fall through.  Everyone seems hype about it and excited that we might do something, but im sure it will be a big let down.  I also have to say Scott is a horrible organizer, and constantly has ideas like this.  He gets halfway through them and gives up, mainly because he figures they will never work, or he has other things to do.  However, im just 'Scotts Little Brother,' so everything I say against him is either retarded or gay, even though I know him better than anyone else.  Just ask me to name some of his outrageous ideas without plan and ill be more than happy to tell you.  I love Scott, but its normally better to just keep my mouth shut and watch him screw up on his own, then I dont get beat up.  So I guess its back to the drawing board, and back to youth, to start over again for the 3rd time in 5 years.  Right now, we might not have a director for a year or so, and even if we do get one, the odds of him staying for more than 3 years is not very high.  The past 3 youth directors we have average about 2 years a peice.  Not to good.  At least I have 2 more years of high school.  And I thought these times at youth were supposed to be good times.  Anyways, I think im done rambling here.  Dont be offended if you read this.  It is only from my perspective, and quite honestly, I dont care if your offended.  I also dont know the entire details to everything, so a lot is from my point of view, and what I see and understand.  Thats all.",

There seemed to be no point in forcing myself to be part of something where I didn't feel welcome or valued. Pulling back was a way to protect myself from feeling even more rejected—instead of waiting around, I decided to step away until I could figure out how I wanted to fit in, and whether it was worth trying any longer.",

This last lapse is due to something much more sinister and sad. My wife has a birthday coming up on March 2nd and she had asked for a puppy. She had always had dogs as a kid, but none of them was actually hers. They were family pets that didn't belong directly to her. So she wanted a puppy to call her own. Truth be told I've wanted a cute little canine for myself since my first dog, Fluffy, was heinously taken from me due to the deprecations of the dastardly bitch queen and her hench-younguns. The full story reserved for publication at a later date. So after my eye doctor appointment this last Friday we went out to the illustrious Clark County Humane Society to see what they had. What they had was the cutest little shepherd mix pup we'd ever seen. He was brown with black muzzle markings and those personality melting liquid brown eyes that puppies are infamous for having. My wife couldn't resist his nefarious charms and, frankly, neither could I. We were lost in the grip of the 'puppy'. God, I love that feeling. Anyone who knows me will tell you that I have a special place in my heart for just about any animal and the animals know it. Dogs and cats take to me as if I were one of them, a fact I revel in daily. Saturday became a giddy place with endless fields and a burbling brook where a boy and his puppy can run forever. I know it was Heather's puppy, but he was a great little guy. Heather named him Rama. By now you've probably realized that I keep referring to Rama in the past tense. Parvo. It seems like a harmless enough collection of vowels and consonants, but its meaning to dogs and their owners is profound. Its a virus with symptoms much like the flu. Its deadly, and hard to treat. Treatment involves five days in a cage with an IV drip. All that for a 50/50 chance to live. I have to wonder what fucked up thing I did that my karma could be so goddamned bad that a puppy had to die. I've seen enough death in my thirty-three years, I don't want to see any more. I hate death. Its a filthy bastard with jagged teeth and an insatiable appetite. FUCK HIM! I suppose you can see that I'm upset. My wife was, and is, worse yet. I guess I have to stop, the screen is getting blurry and I feel like smashing something. Until the filthy bastard takes me, I'll be here.",

I'm not going to puruse the electric guitar.  It's just not something that I really want to do.  I've realized that my passion is the acoustic, and playing it really, really well.  I think about all the time.  Last night, I was sitting on the second row at Safeco Field along the first baseline.  It was great game, and yet I missed most of the fourth, fifth, and sixth innings because I was thinking about how to better voice my chords in this new CGDGBC tuning.  It also hit me over the weekend at a worship event that I played keys at.  I've been playing piano for 20 years.  I'm great at it, but I spent the entire 2 hour set listening to the acoustic player.    I've realized that I play electric because it is 'cool' in the eyes of most to play the electric.  There's something cool about playing note-for-note with The Edge.  Teenagers get really excited when you can play their favorite rock song just like it sound on the radio.  It was these reasons that caused me to want to play electirc.  I've realized that if I had my way, all I would play is my acoustic.  I've realized that my playing electric has been mostly driven by a desire to please others, and not my own creative drive.  So I'm just going to stop.  I have my Les Paul in case I need to fill in for the occasional church service, but from now on, I'm just going to focus on my acoustic and get as good as I can possibly get at it.  I'm doing it because it's going to satisfy an artistic need that I have instead of meeting the perceived expectations of others.  The majority of you who read this site are musicians and artists.

        "blog_text": "Appreciation  The Healing Heart of Annalena Tonelli  Humanitarian Gave Her Life to Helping Others  By David Brown Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday, October 8, 2003; Page C01    We live in an age of the hidden motive. Every action has a shadow life where its real truth lies, and we're told the wise person would best be on the lookout for it from the start. In many ways we're especially suspicious of selfless deeds. Even when goodness doesn't bring money, status and power, doesn't it pay off richly in some other egotistical currency?   Perhaps this is true, although it seems as naive a view as the one it purports to overthrow. But even if it is, there are people who are in some essential way exceptions to this weeding of human agency. Annalena Tonelli was one of them. Tonelli spent her adult life rescuing, treating and curing people with tuberculosis and other diseases in Somalia and Kenya.   She was a fearless and tireless person who also seemed incapable of discouragement. She was unsentimental and calculating when necessary. She eschewed organizations except for ones she created and could move -- or abandon -- at will, like the collection of desert people she so loved and admired. In her life -- 60 years, more than half of it spent in East Africa -- she saved thousands of lives. Three days ago, she lost hers.   According to wire service reports, Tonelli was shot twice in the head Sunday night when leaving a hospital for tuberculosis patients in Boorama, a city in northern Somalia. It is hard to imagine what the reason for this crime might be.   I met Tonelli 10 years ago when I went to Somalia to report on the late stage of the disastrous famine accompanying civil war in that country. I spent three days at an institution she established in Merca, a city on the Indian Ocean south of Mogadishu. She called it Koch Hospital -- a reference to Robert Koch, a German bacteriologist and early tuberculosis researcher -- rather than a more obvious name that would draw attention to the wasting and stigmatizing disease of its occupants.   At the time, it was the only place in Somalia treating tuberculosis patients correctly and adequately. She had 700 under her care, and 1,500 diagnosed and awaiting treatment, when I was there. The most ill, including about 100 children, stayed in three adjoining houses with courtyards she had refitted as open wards. Around town she and her assistant had rented more than 100 houses where patients, and often whole families, stayed while taking six months of antituberculosis drug therapy -- the essential, indivisible requirement for cure, and one especially difficult to apply in a country of nomads and people displaced by civil war. Tonelli fed them and treated them entirely for free. Patients came from the entire southern half of Somalia, most arriving emaciated and near death.   'If they die they die in the first or second day,' she told me as we walked through one of the courtyards one morning. Under awnings skeleton men lay, or, if they were strong enough, sat on woven mats. At their heads were their few possessions: shoulder bags, hollowed gourdlike satchels, tea kettles. Each had a small earthenware spittoon that was given a layer of fresh sand each day at dawn. 'If they take drugs for two weeks, it is done. Almost nobody dies then.'   Done, but of course not over. Curing TB takes time and patience, and Tonelli had both in portions hard for an American to comprehend.   She grew up near Bologna. Her father was an economist and authority on cooperatives, her mother a homemaker. She was the second oldest of five children. A brother, Bruno, now a physician, still lives in their home town of Forli. It is the hub of several networks that raise money for his sister's work.   Tonelli was a bit of a child prodigy. She trained as a lawyer but most of all wanted to go into the developing world. 'My family did not want it. So I took the first chance.'   She arrived in East Africa in January 1969 and has worked there on and off ever since.   For many years she treated TB patients in northern Kenya. Most were ethnic Somalis, dry-land herdsmen. The patients would not stay in hospitals, and their families would not wait for them. Tonelli didn't try to change their ways. She built open-air treatment centers called manyattas, where people could stay for the half-year course of treatment. When it was time for a person to leave, she put the word out and the patient's family would magically appear in a week or so and pick him up.   She performed this work largely out of public view until 1985. That was when the Kenyan army was sent in to kill members of a local tribe with links to Somali guerrillas in Ethiopia. Hundreds of people were massacred and the wounded left to die.   'She took her Toyota, painted a red cross on it and went out into the desert with water,' said Barbara Lefkow, 76, of Chevy Chase. At the time, Lefkow was the wife of an American diplomat in Nairobi and was also a physical therapist who worked on and off with Tonelli. 'She and a few of her assistants picked up the survivors and brought them back to the rehab center. She saved some of them, and she made a list of the dead and gave it to me to smuggle out.'   Tonelli's action and the publicity surrounding it led the Kenyan government to expel her. She returned to Italy, received training in Liverpool on treating tropical disease and eventually returned to Somalia to take up the work again.   The logistical difficulty of that work is hard to imagine. In Merca she supervised the purchase of fresh food for hundreds of people each day. She had a large local payroll to administer. And the key to curing TB is directly observing treatment -- watching every patient swallow his or her medicine every day. If she did not do it all personally -- she had helpers including trained physicians who worked with her for long periods -- she was nevertheless the person everyone wanted to see, the one who faced down the brigands when they snooped around, and heard the numberless personal supplications of patients.   As I followed her one day she moved with something beyond the self-preserving patience that clock-watching Westerners adopt to keep from going crazy in the developing world. It was an ability to see individuals at every moment. She refused to carry a radio that would interrupt her.   As one American aid worker who knew her in Merca said, 'She has time for everybody. She is not easily distracted. It is a very saintly characteristic.'   She lived with aesthetic simplicity, her chief source of pleasure several children, abandoned by their families, whom she adopted. Them, and the silence of the deep night when everyone was finally asleep.   'I was a small child when I felt like this,' she said of her desire to find all she wanted in the service of others. 'Many people speak of sacrifice, but for me it was never a sacrifice. I often felt there was nobody on Earth who had such a privilege as to live like this.'   If pressed, she would admit she was religious. 'I always feel the presence of God,' she said one night as I quizzed her on the subject over dinner. She also would admit that her goodness was hard work.   'The reason that more people don't feel this way is that they don't try hard enough. You have to give time, you have to be patient; and then, year and after year, you'll see that what matters is only love. But if you're impatient because people are not grateful or you were full of limits, you will not be happy. You need time.'   Annalena Tonelli had time, but not nearly enough.",

        "blog_text": "Tonight is the fourth day in a row this week I've walked with Katy. It's good for me, emotionally and physically. I can be disciplined, but I can procrastinate. It's a weird juxtaposition of my personality, I suppose. Anyway, Katy is good to walk with because she's fun to talk with, and she likes plans, and that's a sort of accountability. Each time we finish walking, well, actually when we finish talking after walking, we talk about when the next time is we can walk. This has been a consistent week because I didn't have anything to cover for work at night. Weird, I know.   So, do you think it's possible I'm healthier now that I have diabetes and am managing it well because I know I have it? There was a good year, probably, that my body was hurting inside even though I didn't know it because I didn't know my pancreas had decided, or maybe been forced, to stop producing insulin to properly break down sugars (and starches, which turn to sugar...). I mean, I eat healthier now and exercise more. That's got to be a good combination. With that, I feel better, sleep better... It's really amazing how everything is connected. It's just weird to think that having a chronic disease like diabetes could be good for me in a certain, maybe slightly twisted, way. I've had a couple high blood sugar numbers lately, which is sort of random, but I know it happens. But I've learned to deal with that and take it all as it comes and not stress about what-ifs. And, trust me, that's hard for a perfect melancholy girl who likes to control everything and be able to have all her expectations met.   I've also been thinking about personality, birth order, nature versus nurture, family influence, friend influence ... The psychology behind who I am, and who others around me are, I guess. Some people can define their mood in a word. Others moods change with the second hand of a clock. Some people love easily; some people find it easier to complain. One person might forgive easily, when another shoves the sadness and hurt inside. Laughing comes easier to some. Some people are easier to laugh with for me. Closure is important to some people, but others move on easily. Simplicity and complexity get confused in some lives, while others live comfortably in shades of gray. Relationships are built by strangers but are too often influenced by their individual experiences and backgrounds, most of which are rooted in childhood moments over which we didn't have much control. Some people welcome change; others run from it. But, probably, most people, at least most people I love, are a strange combination of in between all extremes. Probably because we're all stuck in trying to be who we want to be in a world of who others want us to be and how other people have helped shape our lives, intentionally or accidentally.   I took a personality test a few months ago...  In short, there are four personality types -- popular sanguine, powerful choleric, perfect melancholy and peaceful phlegmatic. The test is divided into strengths and weaknesses, and often people are a combination of two of those types.   My strengths are dominated with perfect melancholy traits:   deep and analytical  serious and purposeful  talented and creative  sensitive to others  self-sacrificing  conscientious  idealistic  schedule-oriented  perfectionist with high standards  orderly and organized  neat and tidy  sees the problems  needs to finish what's started  likes lists, graphs, charts  makes friend cautiously  content to stay in the background  avoids causing attention  faithful  will listen to complaints  deep concern for people    My weaknesses are split between powerful choleric and perfect melancholy, leaning a bit more toward the choleric:   bossy  impatient  can't relax  enjoys controversy and arguments  won't give up when losing  little tolerance for mistakes  demanding of others  decides for others  is too independent  possessive of friends and mate    Then melancholy slips in the weakness column, sometimes contradicting choleric-like traits, such as dislikes emotions and tears, manipulates others, is not complimentary, knows everything and can't say 'i'm sorry':  moody   self-centered  guilt feelings  not people-oriented with work  depressed over imperfections  chooses difficult work  hard to please  standards often too high  deep need for approval  critical of others  full of contradictions  skeptical of compliments    This is very interesting to me, mainly because those lists of strengths and weakness ring so true in my life. It would interesting to hear what other people think about my interpretation of myself. There I go, analyzing...   I'll end with a quote from a good book I just finished reading. It's a political, legal drama by Richard North Patterson called 'Balance of Power.'  Personal lives are as complex as the reasons that people are happy, or sad. ... In any life, there are decisions which keep up us at night, long after they are made. There are decisions which others would make differently.",

Sharon Osborne would be my mother if she was married to a British rock star.  My mom swears only slightly less than Ms Osborne.  They even have the same haircut and vaguely elfin look about them.  My mother's dream job would be to drive a dump truck.  Not just any dump truck, mind you, but a purple one with flames on the side.  If I ever win the lottery, I will buy her one and a large chunk of land on which to drive.  This would make her happy.  Mom's actually a nurse in a neonatal intensive care unit.  I was born a month early (4lbs) and unable to suck.  Ever since, that's what she's wanted to do.  She went back to school when I was 12 and my youngest sister was 5.  She got her associates, passed the RN exam, and continued for her bachelor's.  Her goal was to finish her BS before I finished high school, and she did it by a semester.  Mom did home health mother-baby visits for a while.  She liked that.  It was scary sometimes, when she would go to the inner cities, run-down rural meth towns, really violent areas.  She would have to pass groups of tough-looking men with knives, guns, etc, on the way to the houses.  They would step aside, call her ma'am, thank her for what she did.  She was the first female graduate of her nursing school to   not   wear the stupid little white hat.  If the men didn't have to, she wasn't going to.  No-one since has been required to wear it.  Her other non-hospital job was as a school nurse.  She did sex ed there as part of her job.  She had to follow the school script, which was only a step above abstinence only.  However, the word got out that if you wanted the real information, all you had to do was ask.  She kept Planned Parenthood cards in her office, in case any student needed help.  She worked at the school for about a year, then went back to the hospital for the money.  So now she's back there, taking care of babies and mothers and fathers, easing the discomfort of the babies and comforting the parents, reassuring them everything will be OK, and having them over for dinner.  She sees healthy but small babies (feeder-growers), babies with birth defects, drug babies, alcohol babies, babies that are wanted, babies that are given up for adoption, babies whose mothers wanted to abort them but were talked out of it or couldn't afford it and now look forward to a life of poverty and abuse, since most of those mothers were using substances/in abusive relationships/abusive themselves/abused as children/extremely poor/already have 4 or 5 kids/can't afford birth control.

Forced talaga dahil tatlong linggo na ng overtawad at wala halos sabado at linggong hindi ako pumupunta sa opis. Kinailangan na ng magpumulit ng aking katawang papagpahingahin siya ng aking baluktot na isipan. \nBukas, lilipad ako patungong Cebu. Oo Cebu 'B'-- linya sa isang lumang TV commercial sa mga nakakatanda pa. Ang sarap sanang magnakaw ng panahon para tumawid na rin papuntang Dumaguete pero hindi mangyayari. Wala ang aking dapat na tour guide. \nIsang hamon din ang binigay ko sa sarili para sa biyaheng ito. Dapat isang bag lang ng gamit ang dala, dahil overnight lang naman. Naisip ko, pangarap ko nga palang maging isang jetsetter. Sabi ng Hyperdictionary, 'JET SET Definition: [n] a set of rich and fashionable people who travel widely for pleasure'. Yan ang gusto kong maging. Yung pag naisipang gustong pumunta sa ganito at ganyang lugar, handa ang pasaporte, walang iniisip na hahadlang trabaho na maiiwan, walang bagaheng mabibigat: shirt, shorts, bikini at ngiting nakapinta hanggang sa langit. \nNoong isang araw, bago naalala ng aking tumatandang utak na may lakad nga ako sa Cebu, biglang kinati ang aking paa, sa isip nakaramdam ng biglang pangungulila sa pagbibiyahe. Inakalang hindi ko na ito magagawa dahil sa Nobyembre, balik eskuwela ako. Tapos kahapon lang, nanonood ng palabas sa TV tungkol sa ganda ng ibang lugar, naisip ko na naman, ang sarap magbiyaheng bakasyon ang dahilan. Yung wala kang dapat tapusin munang trabaho bago magpakasaya. Yung bang unang hakbang palang ng paa palabas ng pinto, wala ng sasayangin kundi sa pagsasaya. \nSa Nobyembre, umaasa akong isang bakasyon na rin yun. Isang buwang madaliang pag-aaral ng isang kursong dapat sana ay isang taon. Hmmm, paanong mangyayari ang aking bakasyon? Marami raw pag-aaralan, mga kilay na susunugin para masulit ang dolyares na inutang ng bayan para ipangmatrikula ko. Utang na utang ko rin. Pero kahit ganoon, bakasyon pa rin. Walang mga kontratang hahabulin, gagawan ng sulat at ipagmamakaawa at ipagpepenitensiyang pirmahan ng mga diyos at diyosa sa gobyerno. Walang mga buhay na iisipin dahil nakakabit sa mga papeles na nakatambak sa aking mesa. Walang magulong kuwartong uuwian at paulit-ulit na iisipin kung saan sisimulang lilinisin. \nKaso, kakambal ng bakasyon ay pamamaalam. Paalam sandali sa magulong buhay. Tapos, maya-maya lang, paalam na naman sa katahimikan at sa pamamahinga. Nakakapagod, gugustuhin mo uling magbakasyon. \nSabi ng aming piloto sa opisina, kapag nasa Cebu na, huwag kalimutang tikman ang beer doon. May kakaibang sarap raw. Maaring sa tubig na ginagamit. Naisip ko, oo nga, teka, Octoberfest at wala pa akong tagayang pinagpiyestahan. Bukas nga kabawasan sa aking alcohol quota. May magpapainom, walang hahawak ng aking baso. Pero tiyak may kabawasan din sa saya ng kanilang gabi. \nSabi rin pala sa akin, ang Beer Grande ay nagsimula sa Cebu. Hmmm, parang napapaisip ako. Kelan kaya darating ang araw na magtatagpo ang Bakasyon at Grande? \nPag dumating iyon, sasabayan ko ng awit ng isang lumang kanta, 'Come Fly with Me'",

The weight of my mistakes felt like a physical hold on me.  I tried to stifle my tears as I wept uncontrollably.  How different my life had become.  How far from who I thought I was going to be, had I become.  Josh shifted his weight and snuggled closer.  He did love me.  He did care, but even that wasn't enough to lift the sadness that I felt.  Sensing I was awake, he leaned in for a kiss and felt the dampness on my cheeks.  'What's wrong?' he asked. 'Nothing, just a bad dream.' I replied.  He pulled me closer. 'What kind of dream?' he pried. 'The kind best forgotton.'  I said and turned to face him, snuggling close for warmth and assurance. 'You're unhappy.' Josh stated.  With the way he said it, I knew I had to explain.  For he was not the source of my unhappiness and I couldn't bear the thought of him thinking he was. 'Yes, I am.  If I died tonight, I know I wouldn't be with God when I woke.  But I don't know where to go from here either.'  The emotions began to flow as I once again began to sob uncontrollably. 'I always thought that if you would just become more like me, we could be together and we would both be happy.  But now that you have, your joy is gone and I can't stand to see you so unhappy.'  He pulled me closer and wept as well.   \n2 Months Later...   \n'You're pregnant.'  The doctor gave me a half smile, as if he wasn't for sure whether the news would be a happy or sad event.  I managed a lopsided smile back and he continued, 'This is a surprise.'  He stated it, sensing my fear.  'More like a heart attack.'  I laughed as I responded. 'Will your parents be a good support system?' he asked, genuninely concerned. 'Probably not, but my boyfriend will be.' I replied trying to sound more confident than I felt. 'There are other options.' he said. 'No, there aren't.  Not for me.' He nodded and said he would get me a referral for a doctor and a prescription for prenatal vitamins until I could schedule an appointment.  I thanked him, took my papers and made my way to the waiting room and paid my bill.  I made it to my car before I completely fell apart.    \nPregnant!  I was 18 and pregnant, unmarried.  Oh God!  How could I have gone so far!  Once again I felt so trapped, surrounded by darkness even though it was daylight outside.  I picked Josh up from work and I didn't even have to say anything.  He just reached over and held me for a long time.  When we parted he looked in my eyes and said, 'I love you.  We will make this work...together.  Marry me.'  I looked at him and wanted so much to say yes and have the 'happily ever after', but I couldn't ask that of him.  To give up his life for me and a baby.  Sensing my doubt, he took my hand, 'Don't even think of saying no.  I'm not walking away.'  It was settled.  I would marry him.  The next few weeks were a blur as we made definitive plans before we told our parents.  We knew that if we already had plans in place, it would help our parents to see us not only as a couple but as logical thinkers.  We found a trailer and decided on a simple ceremony, no big flashy wedding, just a simple dress and him in his suit and tie.  Now all that was left was to tell the family the news.  He dropped me off at home before he drove home for the night.  I hoped it was too late for my mom to be up, but she was in the living room.  'I got this in the mail today.'  It was an envelope addressed to me from Department of Family Services, already opened. 'You opened my mail?'  I blurted. 'You want to explain?'  she asked, hurt evident on her face. 'I'm pregnant.  Josh and I are getting married.  We have a trailer in town....I'm sorry.' I finished lamely. 'When were you going to tell me?'  she shouted.  We were both crying now. 'I don't know, things have just happened so fast.' 'I'm not taking care of that child.' 'I didn't expect you to.' 'How could you?' 'I'm sorry.'  Silence..unending silence it seemed.  Finally mom spoke, softer this time, 'You don't have to marry him you know?' 'I want to.  He's a good man.'  More silence.  Then mom stood up and walked out of the room.  I have never felt so alone.    \n1 Month Later   \nTelling his parents didn't go much better.  Again the reassurance that 'they' weren't going to raise that child, and how could we have been so stupid.  But wedding plans were made, and as time had passed, both parents wanted the marriage at least to have a proper start with a wedding and had offered to help in various ways.  It would still be small, but at least memorable and the family would attend.  Now it was time to get everything out in the open.  Tomorrow, Josh and I would stand before our church and let them know what was going on.  During the last few months Josh had learned that there was a God who loved him and forgave him and wanted to be the Rock for him to lean on during this time.  Josh had given his life to that Rock.  Hope surged.  It might work. Oh God, please let it work.  I am so sorry.  How many times had I said that?  A gazillion.  Was it enough?  Was the sorry for going against what He wanted enough?  I didn't know.    \n'God, please, somehow show me it is enough.  I have nothing left to give.'  I prayed as I tried to rest.  The baby inside of me moved.  How I had grown to love this little one.  How confusing it was to love something that came about as a mistake.  As sin.   \n'Oh God, help me to know how to feel.'  Sleep came, many hours later.    \nThe Next Morning   \nThe service seemed to last an eternity.  Song after song, words and more words.  I couldn't concentrate on any of them.  Then at last, the last prayer and the pastor moved forward once again.  This was it.  I heard him say something about forgiveness, something about restoring those with a repentant  heart and the next thing I new Josh and I were moving toward the stage.  Somehow, I managed to climb the steps.  Then I heard Josh talking, crying, and talking and then somehow I managed to begin talking and weeping.  Looking into the faces of people who had loved me since I was a child.  And when I looked, they didn't have angry faces, but many were weeping as well.  Finally, Pastor Scott took over and prayed for us and then told the congregation that they could do whatever God had called them to do.  As I stood to the side, trying to control my weeping, I saw a line begin to form heading toward the front.  Toward me and Josh.  Person after person clung to me and looked me in the eye and said 'I forgive you.'  Then, Donna came to me.  She hugged me close and then looked in my face with tears streaming down her face and she said, 'I've always told Miranda to look up to you.  That you were a good model of a girl who's heart was for God.'  I dipped my head as I worried as to what would come next.  This was a woman who had taken time out for me, prayed with me.  Someone who I had truly disappointed.  Someone who she had told her daughter to look up to, and I had let her down.  Oh God forgive me!  She struggled with her emotions and finally caught my gaze and said, ' And I still will.'  The darkness lifted.  And I was standing in the light once again. It was enough.   \nThat was the day I learned what freedom was about.  Freedom from the bondage of sin.  True freedom can only come from God.  When I needed tangible freedom from my sin, God gave it to me in the form of a woman who could have so easily been angry with me, but instead gave me the sweet taste of forgiveness and freedom.  He's still there today offering me freedom in Him.  Freedom from the enslavement of my own desires.  And He does for you too.  This story is based on a true story.  It's my story.  It's been awhile, so exact wording and the timeline might be a bit off, but the heart of the story is true.  My hope by repeating the story is that someone else may find freedom as well.",

Tell the stripper, because she of course will find it fascinating, and do everything in your power to make you feel normal about it.  Tell no one else.  Ever.  So what do I do?  Tell the cat lovers at work.  Rub it in their faces.  Make them know that not only am I a catkiller, I think there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.  Of course, I'm not a catkiller.

That would suck ass.  i'd have to spend my senior year taking those fucking classes all over again instead of doing what I wanted to do.  Two more days... I'm dying.  I need to get out before I kill myself.  a number of my better friends graduated this weekend.  i'm already feeling more exposed.  It feels great, except not.  This guy I dated for a while was at several of the same parties as me... he's a thespian too.  I tried talking to him and it was all cool, because I stil kinda like him, i guess.  But I put him through too much shit for him to be able to forgive me, and so the best I can do is act like I'm not really, really pissed at myself right now.  So I'm moving on.  But it's hard when he's there, laughing (in a nice way) at my lack of ability at fooseball, or watching my other classmates playing video games while I run my hands through his hair (hey! my friend was playing with my other ex's hair!... god, that sounds wierd.  but hey, It's a dysfunctional group)...  I should probably control myself better.  He's not even cute, really.  nice, yes.  Smart, very.  he's so goddamn smart, i feel like I'm nothing just talking to him.  But he can make me feel like I'm better than him when he wants to.  That was nice, when he did it.  Now I can only kinda touch him.  things get wierd when I'm behind him, running my hands through his hair like I'm fascinated by how curly it is, all the while hoping that he'll tell me to either back off, or that he gives a shit about me.  Because he's said nothing either way.  he won't tell me he's pissed, he won't tell me he's ok.  And yet so many times in the school hallway, he tries to go in the opposite direction of me, whether or not there's ten more yards to go before we actually pass each other.  Why the fuck won't he ust tell me to fuck off?  Because, man, i need a reality check.  i'm going crazy.  I really llike him.  and of course, being the fucker that I am, I screwed things up.  figures.  Meh.  I just gotta worry about school right now.  Forget him.  he's just a guy.

        "blog_text": "The world of the third-year medical student is not beautiful. You get bled on by your patients, shit on by your residents, ignored by your attendings, condescended to by the nurses, and graded by just about everybody, the weight of their evaluation inversely proportional to both a) how much time they've actually spent getting to know you and b) the esteem in which they hold you.  For periods of a month or so, you get thrust into a new milieu - psychiatry, surgery, medicine, OB/GYN, neurology, etc - and by the time you've started to learn how to play the game, it's time to switch. Your hours are long, your schedule capricious, variable, and often downright whimsical. You are expected to learn independently, which is manifested by the following typical encounter:  [leaving patient room] Student - How do you manage [insert patient disease]? Resident - That's a good question. Why don't you look it up tonight and give us a five minute presentation on it during rounds. Student - [mumbling while walking away] Thank you, O great one, for elucidating that important point of clinical management. I feel edified.  Resident - I'm sorry, did you say something? Student - No.  You are expected to be there before your residents, tagging along at their heels, and, if you're lucky and hard-working, they might take a few minutes to teach you something once in a while. You learn clinical management on the fly, listening, watching, working. Every piece of work you do that isn't total scut (take out that foley, draw those bloods, check how much urine she put out, run this form over to the next building, pick up coffee) is duplicated by the housestaff, so you don't even have the satisfaction of having your carefully written note having saved anyone any work. It's sad, demoralizing, difficult.  But is it _poetic_? Is it _epic_? Are there still stories worth telling? And why? Yes, yes, yes, and how.  Why? Why. Because last week I delivered a baby with my bare (well, gloved) hands. What entitled me? Paying $50,000 a year in tuition? All my diligent study of biochemistry, anatomy, pathophysiology? Honestly, everything I knew about childbirth at that point was taken from a twenty page chapter in a book called 'Blueprints in Obstetrics' which I read over the course of an hour. I'm an ordinary guy thrust into extraordinary situations, given opportunities and responsibilities that most people will never have, for better or for worse. Yes, I wrote a poem about my cadaver. We don't need to go there.  Most of my third year is over, meaning that much of that initial excitement is over. It only gets harder from here, and the absolute newness of being blooded in the OR, of delivering the sort of bad news that no one ever wants to give, of bringing a baby into the world, is perhaps over. What comes next is time to chew on it, time to reflect, time to see if I can think about the way stories in medicine work, to see if I can use my experience as fodder for creative and critical work. Your mission, dear reader, should you choose to accept it, is to follow along, to ruminate with me, to tell me if I'm getting at something you want to see and read for something other than the vicarious experience of medical training.  If you want to reach me and let me know what you think of what I'm writing and saying, my email is doctorno@verticalmattress.com. If you find this blog and like it, let me know.  Much love,  Dr. No",

        "blog_text": "So, I have to write this whole thing over again. I'm very angry right now at my internet connection,. Usually, I'd forget writing the whole thing again, but this is a rather important entry.     Tonight was a lot of fun. It's odd though. I can have so much fun with people and the whole time, in the back of my mind, the fact that one of the people I'm with wont be in our little group in about five days permeates my mind.     We had Tom's goodbye party at Chili's. There were twelve of us. Tom, Manmeet, (I didn't know him at all) Mary Clare, Stephen, Chen, Chang, Kelly, Amit, Roger, Jeremy, Kathryn and me. It was a big table. Heh. It was ironic too. While we were waiting to get our table, my brother came in with his friends. Out of all the times and all the places, I saw them. Interesting. Well, welcome home for the weekend Chip. Hah.     Dinner was a lot of fun. Just good conversation and good food. It was pretty funny at the end while we were trying to pay the bill and we couldn't figure it out. Heh. It took us a while, but that's ok. It was funny. Oh, another funny thing from dinner. Roger was ordering Cajun chicken...except he said the j and u like you would in Spanish, so it sounded like 'cahoon.' And then Stephen goes...'you mean...Cajun??' Haha. Funniest thing I've heard in a long time.     Then, because Jeremy gave Tom fireworks as a gift, we all went to Tom's house to see if we could shoot them off, but then we realized that even though Tom's house and land plot are huge, he has a ton of trees, and the treeless area is his neighbor's area. Boo.     So, of course, where do we go? MG. Where do we always go? Hah. Meadow Glens is becoming like a second home to me. Sad...really.     So, we sat around there for a while trying to figure out what to do and we notice this empty beer case sitting on the sidewalk and we're just like, 'we'll just leave it alone. It's not ours.' So, we did and of course, who comes to see us? Cops. An undercover cop came by and was like, 'is that yours?' And of course we're all like, 'No, no!' And so, we just told him we were talking and stuff and he said ok and let us hang out. Cool cop. And, as he was leaving, Jeremy goes, 'Bye Mr. Pavlicek.' I guess he knew him somehow. It was just funny. Mr. Pavlicek said bye to Jeremy too. Heh, of all the cops to come across us. Chris' dad. Funny, funny times.     And so, we were all getting eaten by bugs and we all were a little cold, so we made a fort with the minivans. We backed them all together and had the trunks up so it made a little tent. It was super cool. I'll have to put a picture in here when MC gets them developed. So, we just sat and chatted and told fun stories.     It's sad knowing tonight was the last time I'll see Tom. Although he did embarrass me at times (like the last time we were at Meadow Glens) I'm still going to miss him a ton and think how much hed add if he were here. It's funny though, I wont remember the big embarrassments or the arguments Ive had in high school. What I'll remember is the summers spent with my friends sitting in the back of a few minivans in the Meadow Glens parking lot. Ill remember the three hour time spans spent sitting around trying to figure out what were going to do while constantly veering off topic. I'll remember the little things. The things that make it impossible to forget my friends. Amazing how watching a terrible movie or stalking boys can get me through supposedly one of the toughest times in my life. Its too bad it takes a friend moving away to make me realize how precious the time I spend with my friends is.   I hope Tom has a great time in Texas and I hope he doesn't forget us, because I know I wont ever forget him.

        "blog_text": "LOST IN TRANSLATION   We went to dinner tonight at Murphy’s in Virginia Highlands and planned to see  Lost In Translation  afterwards.  I was frustrated with 2F’s because I told him we needed to be at the restaurant by 7pm and he didn’t get into the shower until 6:45pm.  He acted as if it was no big deal to keep Donald & Julie waiting.  If the shoe was on the other foot, I would receive a judgmental diatribe that I would have to end abruptly with two choice words.    Parking is always a challenge in the Highlands so we parked about four blocks away.  I was still feeling angry on the inside, but trying to be friendly on the outside.  2F’s was oblivious.  We were inside the restaurant and 2F’s tells me to go check our reservations.  Julie had called and made a reservation for four under my last name and I had called and made a reservation for four under my first name.  Clearing this mix up was almost lost in translation, but finally resolved.  Someone tapped me on the shoulder.  It was Troy from our neighborhood.  I was still struggling with my inner rage and was trying to be friendly.  His partner, Todd, came in and said hello and walked off.  We had all gone to the movies almost a year ago and had a really great time.  In fact, I was looking forward to getting to know them better.  I ran into them at a restaurant once and said hello and they just walked on by.  Granted, I don’t know what was going on inside them at the time, but I at least make the effort of being friendly.    There is a line from the movie where Bill Murray’s character describes what it’s like to grow older.  You begin to realize what you want and you don’t care what other people think.  I’m tired of dealing with the bi-polar swings of other people.  From now on I think I will just do and say exactly what I think.  What’s wrong with letting people know you feel pissed on the inside at the moment?  It’s how I feel.  I want to people to see my dark, immature, dangerous side as well as the loving, devil-may-care, laid back side.  It’s real.  It’s sexy.  It’s me.  I related to Scarlett Johansen’s character the most.  So much of my life I have felt like a stranger in a strange land.  I’ve wanted to reach out and connect with other people without knowing quite how.  Sometimes I have stumbled and done it badly.  Other times I have done so quite eloquently and still did not achieve the imagined result.  In the earlier part of my life, I had wanted a boyfriend so badly.  I never could find the right fit.  Now I have the perfect boyfriend, but I’ve realized that perhaps what I was searching for was more of a kindred spirit than a partner.    Kent was my best friend growing up.  I had known him since I was 13.  We could have fun doing anything.  We could complete each other’s sentences and others often thought we were lovers, which we were not.  We communicated on so many different levels besides words.  We understood one another… and I’ve never really experienced that again.  I miss having a best friend.  I miss Kent.  I wish that night had never happened and I wish he had never bought that gun.  Scarlett Johanson favors Jeff’s wife, Kim.  When they visited us last summer, Kim and I connected on a very cool level.  The kids went to sleep early and all the Jef(f)s and Kim would sit around at night waxing on about things serious and not so serious.  One night, the boys went out by themselves and it was just Kim and I and we talked until we fell asleep.  It was so exciting.  It was like coming home, but yet I found myself holding back because I knew I needed to protect myself.  I knew as soon as they left, the magic would be gone and we would not be able to maintain the connection.  It was better to nip that euphoria in the bud so I would not be disappointed later.  Expectation is the child of the ego and almost uncontrollable.  It dances with disappointment on a regular basis.  I find I’m much happier if I don’t put expectations on other people.  Perhaps one day if I ever visit Jeff & Kim in Canada, Kim and I will expand upon that connection.  Then again, maybe not.  It will most likely be somewhat different because we will both be different people.  Will it be worse?  Will it be better?  Why not just let it be what it is?  I’ll take door number three, Bob!  We had a great time tonight with Donald and Julie.  They are absolutely two of my favorite people in the world.  We always have the most interesting conversations.  There is still a lot that I don’t know about them, but they seem like the kind of people who prefer to reveal their different layers in time.  I respect that.  Ironically, I have always been someone who wants to know everything about my friends immediately.  Perhaps that is why they came into my life; I have been gifted with the mystery of patience.  2F’s reached out and took my hand during the movie.  I like holding hands.  He has big hands, but they are soft and comforting.  They always make me feel that everything will be alright.  Today while hanging up laundry I found a magnetic dart board set that I bought for myself at Restoration while Christmas shopping.  I had always wanted a dart board ever since I read that Keren Woodward from Bananarama has one in her kitchen.  I opened it for the first time and looked at it.  I smiled to myself and thought, “I never have time to play games.”  Correction: I never make time to play games.  Rebecca Blood stated that one of the reasons people keep a weblog is for self-expression, and in doing so, they gain greater clarity in their thinking.  I believe she is right.

When I first saw him I thought of the caramel in a Twix. We would talk for hours, me lounging across the counter, lipgloss shinin, talkin Jay-Z and feminism. Sometimes I'd stick around until closing time & he'd offer me a ride back to campus. We'd sit in his vintage Bronco until the stars started blinkin. Once I pointed out my freshman dormroom window, he said, 'Oh, so that's where I throw the peebles.' Our flirting was clandestine and innocuous, the perfect accompaniment to an unspoken and mutual attraction. We'd go on semi-dates and he'd attend events I hosted on campus. Then came the hateration. Being that he was the only consistant cuteness within walking distance of campus & the provider of urban tunes, several brownies at my white-washed college craved his dirty drawers. Some caught on to us and not-so-casually-or-nicely confronted us about it, individually. Goldylocks thought it best that we cool it so as not to lose any business. I was hurt but acquiesced none the less.   Time went on (like 2 years)...I left school, visited Rhythm less and saw him less than that.    Then one day we went to the movies, our first date since I left school. It was great! We didn't want it to end so we picked up some beers, a blunt and went to hang with my roomie AlmondLaRoc & her grrlfriend BelleLaBalls. Between smoke & spirits I revealed my undying love for GoldyLocks to Almond & Belle as he went outside to retrieve smething from the car. 'I think he thinks he's too old for me but, I just want him so bad & for so long!' When Goldy came back he had a couple & smoked a lil'. 'I heard what you said when I left. I don't have a problem with our ages. We can do this if you want.' There it was, the open door. Suddenly, I felt panicked and trapped! What could we possibly be to each other: me, a serial neo-polygomist with hopes of children before age 30; he: a 40+ DJ/store owner with no desire for a wife or kids, ever.

Me: 'Um, it's just time.' Goldylocks: 'Well, we gotta hang out before you leave for good.'  We went to see Dogville, an obscure yet original film starring Nicole Kidman. Drinks afterwards. I was on a celibacy kick & loathing myself for it. Goldy was looking fine as ever over the rim of my coke&rum. I had made a decision: I was gonna get wit Goldy before I left the city. He was dropping me off & came in to use the bathroom. This was my chance. All nite I was mulling over what the hell I was gonna say. I've never been a very good seductress.   Goldy: 'Thanks. I thought I wasn't going to be able to hold it.' Candy: 'No problem.' silence. Candy: 'So that was a great film.' Goldy: 'Yeah, really well made.' silence. Candy: 'So...we'll have to do it again sometime soon.' Goldy: 'Definitely.' silence. Goldy: 'Well.

Up until 8:30 this evening, I had a good day.  But at 8:30, I got a phone call.  Not just any phone call, but the person on the other end asked for my husband Chris...a woman.  A woman's voice that I don't recognize.  AND we have caller ID, so I know who called and after looking the number up it is here in Waco and in a part of town where a female friend of Chris's lives.  Now, Chris knows how I feel about this friend.  I had to find out through my best friend that something had happened between them years before I met Chris.  But what gets me, is the fact that she wants to continue this little fling that they had years before, knowing that he's married.  I don't like the fact that she is constantly throwing herself at him, honestly, I hate her.  Truly hate her.  And I don't take that word lightly.  I abhor the word.  But in this case, it fits.  She rubs me the wrong way.  I be nice to her for the simple fact that she is Chris's friend.  But I also know that if I say, 'Don't talk to her.'  That Chris will do just that, so I have to grin and bare.  But honestly, why should I?  He's my husband, not hers.  Sure, we have problems.  What marriage doesn't?  Come on, this is going too far.  He asked me a few nights ago if I was cheating on him.  Now, I'm wondering if he is on me.  Deep down I know that he isn't, at least I hope that he isn't.  Cause that would mean that he's cheating on me with HER.  Now I'm sitting here waiting for him to come home so I can ask him.  The only good thing is, he's a bad liar.  At least he is to me.  He also has a blog that he just started.  He's made one entry that he doesn't want me to read...then why tell me about it?  You know that if you tell someone not to do something that at the first chance that they're going to do it.  So, I've read it.  And he thinks that we're in a loveless marriage.  what he doesn't see that yes, there is love in the marriage, just not the kind he is hoping for.  He wants the dutiful wife that will do whatever he wants whenever he wants.  And I'm not like that.  He's trying to conform me into this wife, and wonders why I'm shying away from him.  He doesn't think about what I've said, past or present.  He picks and chooses what he wants to hear and frankly, I'm at the end of my patient 40 mile long rope.  I'm having thoughts that I shouldn't right now.  Because I do have obligations here.  I have a job that is promising, friends-true friends.  I have the kind of friends that tell me the truth no matter how much it may hurt.  And you know what, I appreciate them for it.  I'm tired of having friends that lie just to save face.  And they aren't like that.  They are true friends down to the core.  Now, I'm here thinking.  Truly thinking.  What to do next?  I'm not getting through him.  How do I?  How do I get through to someone who doesn't want to hear?  I want to make this marriage work.  For better or worse, that what we vowed.  Now, I'm just waiting for the better part.  I've compromised, let go, and then some.  I'm becoming what I vowed I wouldn't.  Dependent.  I've practically given up my independence for the sake of his happiness.  I've become miserable for the sake of his happiness.  I'm becoming depressed, for the sake of his happiness.  And you know what, he's not happy.  I've given him my all and neither of us are happy.  Sure, we have our good days.  But at the heart of it, we're miserable.  I try hard to keep us together but it seems like he's not evening trying.  It seems like he's just here for the ride and lets me do all the work. I'm tired of carrying the burden.  I'm stressing over this burden.  How much more of it will I be able to handle before I crack?  And when that day comes, how bad am I going to lose it?  I don't know if I can handle a nervous breakdown.

My head hurts as usual. I cannot look at the sky. Flowers that I can touch. In the night. In the darkness. The dark is not sheer due to the full moon. It is shining. How did I land into the night out of the day?  Does anyone know the size of my heart?  I am watching I am listening. Somewhere there is this emptiness. Maybe it is inside my heart. I am watching myself in the window. The car is moving fast. The road. It is long. On both sides golden reeds. The light reflecting off the road. Yes, we are all alone in the universe.  I am moving in circles that are infinitesimally concentric until I fall in upon myself. I am so tired. I want something but I do not know what it is. I am hungry and thirsty but it is not water that I want. It is not food that I crave.   I am watching myself fall. The white clothes that I wear flutter as I spread my arms to feel. I wanted to feel. Why couldn’t I ever feel anything that was real? Where is the reality in falling out of the sky? Then you connect with the earth so suddenly and your last image of life is the blue sky. No more doves. Emptiness that is finally real. Maybe blood is flowing out of my mouth and even my head where it connected with the ground. Freefalling objects from an empty blue sky. The thump of something solid falling and hitting ground. That is ground zero for you. Yes sir! Ground zero. Somewhere in the distance, maybe it is the firecrackers going off. The distance is so immense. You are not as far as the poles. You are not as far as the moon. You are farther then the farthest stars. We stand as far as the opposite corners of the universe.   And we are both so alone.  Don’t be sad. I will kiss you.  Do you also feel the emptiness creep out of you sometimes? Some times, you also want to look at the sun. Some times, you also want to go blind. You also wanted things you could not get. Why do we always want thing we cannot get?   I am running after the car. Then I stop because I cannot run. I cannot breathe. Breathing is so difficult. That is why I have stopped running. Not because I have given up.  Circumstances sometimes stop us. Why are they like this for us?  I was wondering at the stars. Sitting under the sky thinking maybe I would know where you were. I never thought you were with me from the beginning. Maybe this is also written in my genes. Or maybe it is because we are both made of stardust.   Is it because of this that even through this distance we can feel each other? Is this really feeling? Or is it deception like everything else?  The mind plays so many tricks on us. I am watching clouds form into faces and battle scenes and birds and flowers. I am ready to die one moment and ready to be reborn another.  I die one moment. And another moment I am born again.  Why don’t I die for once? Is death that easy or that difficult? Does life love me or do I love life. Will I ever know?  In my mind, you had the answer to my questions. I thought you carried something for me in your pocket that would make this hunger go away.  I turn away laughing but I turn away only to hide tears of disappointment. Please take that hand out of your pocket. It made me anticipate so much.",

        "blog_text": "As we sat along the roadside for the THIRD time today we both kinda lost it. Well not, kinda, we did for a moment lose it. Two weeks ago as we were headed to Sarasota to help my grandma with some projects around the house the car randomly died! So we coasted along the side of the road from 70 miles an hour to a complete stop. We looked at each other in complete surprise. The car has run great for the year and a half we’ve had it and this was the first sign of any trouble. We called a tow truck and then called my grandma and she and a friend came to meet us at the shop in Bradenton. Fortunately, we weren’t too far from Sarasota. We could definitely see God’s provision in the fact that the car didn’t break down while I was driving it by myself (I’m sure I would be ok, but being in a big city now, I’m not thrilled about breaking down!) and Grandma’s friend was just getting to walk out the door when we called and he knew exactly where we were and was happy to come with her to pick us up. Naturally, as soon as we get to the shop the car starts right up, even though we’d tried to start it for over an hour alongside the road. Two weeks and two shops later, it’s running fine and no one can find anything wrong with it.  So, we head to Sarasota again to help my Grandma with the projects we didn’t get to finish two weeks ago. With two bathroom ventilation fans in our trunk we get almost to Sarasota and boom! The car dies again. Now we can’t believe it. Again, God was with us and we were able to make it off an exit ramp. Ked called the tow truck and I called Grandma. She can’t believe it. So I walk across the street to McDonald’s and Ked stays with the car. Just as the tow truck shows up the car starts! Now we’re getting annoyed. Grandma shows up, we all shake our heads and head to her place for breakfast.  We had a great day with her as Ked and I replaced the fans in her bathroom. Ked was covered in dust and his arms were tired from being above his head, but we successfully replaced the fans in both her bathrooms. Unfortunately, the holes from the old fans are bigger than the hole for the new fans, so Ked will be making some trim and taking it back down to cover the hole. That is, if we can ever make it back down there.  It was a cold and rainy day, but we decided to head back to our place. What should have been an hour trip took us four hours. The car broke down halfway and we sat alongside the road for at least an hour. We called a tow truck, but true to form, it started again before the tow truck arrived. We drive twenty minutes more and it stops again. This time we decide NOT to call a tow truck and wait it out. Obviously, something is overheating and it just needs to cool down and it starts again. By now, we are tired, dirty and frustrated. And we start to doubt God. It’s amazing how something like this can make you question your foundation. And so we talk. Why does this always happen to us? In our seven year marriage we’ve been stranded alongside the road more times than I can count, and it’s not like we drive junker cars. And we start to doubt all kinds of things, like God’s faithfulness to us, why He hasn’t blessed us more in the area of finances, and so on and so on. We’ve been sitting there an hour and the car still won’t start. This time we’re afraid it’s not going to start again. But in that time as we’ve talked we’ve realized where our faith is weak. If something really so silly and stupid as a car breaking down (fact of life, they just aren’t reliable) we need to re-evaluate where we stand in our faith. So we prayed together, not for the car to be healed, but for our faith to be healed. We desire so desperately to be used by God. To do something marvelous for Him, to use all of our potential, and to hear “well done, good and faithful servant!” And so our time in the car gave us time to reflect and ask God not to hide His plan for us, and to help us live our lives to the fullest for Him, even when we’re broken down alongside the road. Finally after an hour, I have to go to the bathroom REALLY bad. Actually, I’ve had to go for quite awhile. So we call for help and arrange for a tow truck to come and get us. And would you believe it? Ked hangs up the phone and tries the car one more time, and it starts right up. We look at each other in amazement.   Was God just trying to tell us to ask for help? I don’t know if He works in ways like that, but it seems to be a good illustration. Just pick up the phone – get on your knees and ask Me for help! If we learned anything by our three hours by the roadside, it’s that we aren’t alone, even when we feel like it, and sometimes we just need to reach out and ask for help.  We finally made it home, exhausted, drained and ready for bed.",

        "blog_text": "Dear Dad,  You will never read this, and not just because no one ever does, but because it's an on-line journal that you don't even know exists.  I was thinking about you today, however, and wanted to tell you that I appreciate your presence in my life.  Not that I don't think of you or speak to you often, but today I was thinking back on my life and the things that matter to me most.  You have always been there for me in so many ways that are above and beyond the 'call of duty' so to speak.  In ways that are more important than simply standing nearby.  I feel that some of the most precious memories in our lives are not those of great grandeur, but rather those of grandeur disguised by simplicity.    I was thinking recently about my love of aviation as a child, and even to this day.  You actually were interested in aviation yourself, having had your pilots license and a plane of your own in the past.  I, on the other hand, somehow developed the intense interest in aviation at an early age.  I could name any jet that flew over my head simply by looking at the pattern of the lights, wing shape, etc.  Each weekend on a Saturday or Sunday you would take me to the airport and sit with me on that one bench at the private jet terminal of the San Antonio International Airport; just so that I could watch the planes pass by.  After about an hour, you would always say 'you ready buddy?' and we would return home.  Though I have many memories with you, this particular past-time we shared together struck me as symbolic and especially important.   As lame as it sounds, I never outgrew the love of watching the planes go by at the airport.  I remember actually looking forward to turning 16 so that I could drive myself to the airport and not have to ask you to take me there.  In fact, I actually did start taking myself to watch the planes fly over my head.  It was a form of relaxation and escape for me.  Some might get away from the world by going on a drive, some might have quiet time in their room or sitting alone with nature.  I, on the other hand, always knew I could go to my 'spot' and sit and think in peace if I wanted to, enjoying watching the planes fly by.  I would sit wondering where people were going, naming the aircraft in my head as they passed, enthralled in the idea of flight which had always fascinated me.  As I am older now, I realize that spending an hour on a Saturday sitting on a bench while I stared down a runway was probably not the time of your life.  I'm starting to understand though, that memories such as that are what make my childhood special.    Progress long overtook our old bench at the airport, and God knows that they would never allow people to be roaming freely on airport grounds in today's tightly secure transportation environment.  That bench and time we spent there, is much like life though.  You've always given me a 'ride' or opportunity to go to the places I wanted to go or had interest in being; whether it was to the airport, or even college and soon law school.  Your support of my interests and endeavors is priceless to me.  Never once did you even give the inkling of an impression that our weekly airport trip was something of a bother.  To this day you give to me in a completely unselfish way, in a way that I often wonder if I would be able to mimic if roles were reversed.  Thank you for always sitting next to me on the bench.  Thank you for always giving me a ride to the places I wanted to go in that selfless manner you always have possessed.  Thank you for pushing me towards being even half the great person that I think you are.  Thank you for always knowing when it's time to move on with a gentle 'you ready buddy?'  Thank you for caring for me as a son, and thank you for loving me as a person.    How foolish of me to ever have wanted to be 'old enough' to be able to sit on that bench alone.  No matter how old I am, I hope I will always have you to sit next to.  Thank you for supporting me in a way that lets me know that I will never have to be alone in life.  I pray that I will always be able to sit next to you and share even an hour of time together, no matter if the surroundings are of interest to either of us.     I love you Dad, Mason",

I keep telling them, 'Really, this is a bad idea: One of these days these rags are going to catch on fire and burn the house down.' They laugh me off. 'We have been bringing these rags in for long before you were here. There was never any fire' they say. Personally, I try to keep my room as fireproof as possible, but I know that when the house catches on fire, I will die with the rest of them. I would move out, but there is nowhere else to go. Really, I have tried to explain the dangers, but I always get 'God would never let that happen,' or 'We should really bring in fewer rags each day,' or maybe, 'We can keep our gasoline-soaked rags in the bathroom, to make more room in the kitchen,' or even 'I hear that someone is working on some kind of special cloth that will prevent gasoline from igniting.' I say 'But think of the risks: we could all die.' I hear, 'Actually, statistically speaking, only 3/4 of us would die,' or 'I have studied household fires at NYU, and I disagree, statistics clearly show that the casualty rate is most likely to be 35%. While bringing in fewer rags per day or working on making the rags harmless are probably good things to try, somehow I just refuse to be comforted. And I just can't get over the feeling that arguing over how many of us will die is just a waste of time. Sometimes we argue over whether many little rags or fewer big rags is more to blame for the problem. Some have been convinced that gasoline soaked rags really are a problem, and we should switch to Alcohol-soaked rags. Others say alcohol is too expensive, really we should switch to diesel-soaked rags. This argument seems to take up a lot of interest. The idea that we might have to keep a constant number of flammable rags in the house is just too bizarre even to discuss, much less reducing the total number. This frustrates me to the point of just not wanting to talk about the issue anymore. Lately I have had this thought, though: There really are not that many rags lying around just yet. Maybe if there were a small fire, it would get everyone's attention. Maybe then, the other 99 people in my home would come together to fight the fire. The home would be damaged, maybe severely, but if we manage to get the fire out, it might really focus every one of us that we really, really need to stop bringing gasoline-soaked rags into the house. Problem is, I don't want to light any matches. If I do, I will surely be killed by my housemates. But there is this one guy who is really, really careless with matches. It's not that he is deliberately destructive, just accident prone, and more than willing to play with fire. Maybe if I convinced everyone that he is the guy who should be doing the cooking....

        "blog_text": "Heard that new song today---Save a Horse - Ride a Cowboy.     It brings to memory the antics of my sisters and I riding one of our Daddy’s prized white face Hereford Cows. We named this piece of prime beef and hamburger on hooves Bossie and made a pet of her. I can’t even remember who decided we should make this 2000 pound creature our own private carnival ride, all I can remember is riding the thing around the yard, not at a wild gallop but traveling at a slow, sedate walk, ambling along at what seemed to be top speed to a bunch of young gals. She wore a little black felt hillbilly hat and sported a halter. I guess we all wanted to be rodeo stars in a future life or at the very least, be as daring as Annie Oakley. How brave we felt, sitting high on a cow’s back, looking down on the world from our lofty perch. I recall waiting anxiously for my turn, awash with the fidgets, and getting so frustrated when the lucky sister who happened to be atop that cow would turn and smirk at the unfortunate wanta-be-cow-riders waiting their turn. I can also remember Mom having to step in and force the change of rider at a specified time because we were unwilling to relinquish possession.   The cowboys on television make riding a cow seem a difficult and fool-hardy piece of idiocy. The trick is to find a cow that actually likes to be ridden and is tame enough as to encourage this trait. Bossie was that and more. I am also of the opinion that her lack of that pesky testosterone that Bulls (which are boy cows, for those uneducated people) have in abundance had some bearing on her gentleness. For a bunch of girls who had little in the way of summertime entertainment, Bossie was definitely a big hit.   Actually riding a cow was simple. To get on that cow was a more difficult maneuver. Especially for a short woman who was an equally short child. My older sister was long -legged and could easily vault onto her back from the ground. She was lucky. But the short become very resourceful in their hour of need. Either a step up from a littler sister’s back who is down on all fours beside said cow or ever a bucket placed near her hooves became a handy stool to use. Once atop the cow, getting her to move was tougher. She had a tendency to just stand there chewing her cud while you kicked and yelled and pleaded for her to move forward. Once in a while, she would swish her tail to shoo a fly. And maybe even turn her head to take a peek at whoever on her back, all the while chewing and blinking at you. Forward motion of both the cow and, ergo, the cowgirl, was achieved simply by means of an ear of dried corn tied to a piece of twine and to a long stick. Bossie would follow that corn anywhere. To turn left, you moved the corn to the left. Right, same thing, opposite direction. Simple. The cow followed the ear of corn. The problems started when you were holding the corn before you were ready to get going. She went whether you were ready or not. It became necessary to ensure her immobility, and that was to make sure someone else had the corn on the stick while you got on and got settled. And equally important was to make sure she could not see the corn, or she would move before your were ready to go after that food. To stop the ride was equally frustrating, both to the rider and to the cow. Either by means of handing the stick to someone on the ground or throwing it as far away as possible was one means. As long as she didn’t see where it went. The most expeditious means was to simply jump off her back while still in motion and hope for a soft landing.   Of course, our cow riding days were not without risks and numerous mishaps. Getting a small bare foot stepped on by a cow hoof is not a pleasant thing. The steering mechanism also left room for improvement. Bossie had a bad habit for side-swiping barbwire fences. Whether from our terrible steering or from sheer perversity I don’t know. But either way, little bare legs and barb wire fences were not a pretty combination. Equally dangerous were the before mentioned dismounts. Rodeo daredevils had nothing on us when it came to abandoning ship and disastrous landings. We sported many scraped knees and arms and bruises, all badges of honor in our eyes. A few of still have the scars to prove it.   She had twin calves once and one got stuck in the mud at the cow pond. When it died, Bossie’s milk dried up and we raised the other calf on a bottle. When the calf got older, Daddy took it to the slaughter house and had it turned into steak, hamburger and roasts. I can clearly remember sitting at the dinner table where Mom had served some of that beef and refusing to eat any of it. None of us would eat it. We all five sat there with tears running down our faces and watching Daddy as he ate our pet. It would have been like eating our pet dog, sacrilege. He had to give all that meat away to appease us. I can remember when Daddy sold her at the sale barn. We were broken hearted.   All in all, I think all kids should have a pet cow. Preferably one that is amicable enough to allow ambling strolls atop her back. We had dogs, cats, goats and pigs. We have even had opossums and skunks as pets. But, for me, Bossie is the best pet we ever had. Maybe because she was unique, because in all honesty, not many have bovines for pets.",

Guess I'll just have to take that chance. So anyway, what I really wanted to write about is Shana. I hate talking to anyone in the family about her because I don't want to upset them. I mean, what if they're having a good day? Then I pour out all of my stuff and make them start grieving again. Although I know, realistically, that we'll never stop grieving. I still cannot believe that she killed herself. Immediately after, that week, sometimes someone would say it must have been an accident. But come on, Shana was brilliant. She knew how little she was. Taking a bottle of anti-depressants and pain pills was not an accident. She wanted to leave. She wanted the pain to stop. That's why she took them at bedtime.  I still hear my brother describing how he found her. Right after we got to the house he told us everything. Took us up to Shana's room and showed us her bed. Showed us where he carried her to the top of stairs and tried CPR. Told us the police had to pry her out of his arms. Told us she was already getting stiff. And she was cold, he said, so cold. Sometimes I can't stop hearing the stuff from that week. I can hear him crying my name.  I remember so much from that week. Picking out the fingernail polish, helping Grandma iron her clothes. Previewing her hair and makeup with my sisters. We took a picture for reference. My sister was so tough. I couldn't see the details through the tears but J did.  Even writing in my journal I feel like I need to edit stuff out. But I can't. It's time to get this stuff out. Shana's been gone for over a year and I still don't really believe it. She was only 19 and had so much to live for. I'll never stop wondering why.  Her suicide note was in her live journal. Titled 'Enough is Enough'. That's it. I'm done. I love you all... The same message, or maybe a little longer, was set up as an 'away' message in outlook. I never could bring myself to email her so I'd get it back as a reply. I asked my sister if she'd made up an album of Shana stuff. She said she thought the pictures belonged interspersed with other family pictures. I don't know though.

I do that all the time.  Usually, it's that person.  Occasionally, it's just someone who looks a whole lot like them.  I did that the other day, driving back from Walmart.  I looked over in the truck beside me and my mind said 'Hey, that's Chad'.  But, right on the heels of that was 'No - no, it can't be, you dummy'.  Chad's been gone for three years.  I still do that though.  For a long time after he was gone, I saw his face everywhere.  Every time I saw one of the trucks from the business he worked for, I hoped it would be him.  It's funny how the mind tries to deny a loss in little ways like that.  I'll never forget the last time I saw him.  (Well, I guess that would be the next-to-last time.)  He came by late one night.  It was around midnight, I was in my pjs, ready for bed.  I was tired and didn't invite him in.  He was just coming by to tell me that he was going to be on the road again for a while, had a rodeo to be at in Del Rio and then on to San Antonio and who knows where else.  I said the usual be carefuls and have fun.  He said he'd see me when he got back.  That weekend I was at work on the nightshift at the hospital.  When I answered the phone and it was my cousin, I knew something was wrong when she said hello.  She went on to tell me that Chad had been in an accident between Del Rio and San Antonio earlier in the night.  I was instantly filled with dread.  My heart sank further and further as she went on to say that the ambulance picked him up from that road in the middle of nowhere and they took him to the hospital but after working on him for hours they just couldn't get him back.  When she said that, my heart stopped sinking and was just.... numb.  I thought maybe she had it wrong.  Small town grapevines aren't always accurate.  In the back of my head, I knew it was true.  I just didn't want to admit it.  I'd lost many friends in the same way.  Chad was special and his loss hit especially hard.  He wasn't a big guy but he had a big personality.  He was on his way to becoming a big star in the PRCA in bronc riding.  The funeral was ... well, it was indescribable.  Sure, I could tell you what it looked like, what they said and the music they played, and who was there.  But, the feeling... I can't put that into words.  It was huge.  The emotion was so strong it was as if you could reach out and grab a handful of it out of the air.  The thought that kept going through my mind was the scant few nights before.  When he was standing on my front steps, in the glow of the porch light.  I learned the lesson of treating every goodbye as if it were the last.  Because... it very well could be.  I had forgotten about that.  I won't forget again.",

Sometimes a few of my good friends and my brother would confess their heart-felt feelings to me saying that I sometimes go over-board in arrogance and often find me bragging too much about myself.  Looking back, this problem I have been fighting since my early 20s can be traced to my teen years. I craved for parental love & attention in which I lacked much. There is this vague stigma in me to seek for attention and was a very serious problem in my late teens until I realize I did not gain much from deliberate search. I have not been complimented much for the things I do when I was a teenager and today when somebody do compliment me in some ways I get so full of myself. Stop! Analyse! Everybody do crave for some attentions in one way or another. I am guilty of this act myself. Even up to today but there are many possible explanations to this social ill, at least that's what some people would categorize it to be. There is, I think, another part of me, who is innately malignant and suffers from probably minor ADD or Attention Deficiency Disorder. The things I say today would somehow subtly hurt or offen that person I am communicating with. Often it will be too late for me to realize what I have just said is offensive. The way I word things out, as a good friend of mine said, made her felt stupid. What is the psychology of all these when I can sometimes relate and understand people who are doing similar things to me?  My dear mother has always related to me about my childhood and especially my growing years as a teenage boy. There has been a lot of damages done to my brother in my pursuit of attention. Today, my family owes something to God because we, my brother and I especially, did not resort to drug abuse, become a punk in the society, turn out to be a spoil spoilt, or a really psychopath attention disorder patient. As for myself, today I seek attention in my very own way is perhaps, according to mother, the best of two evils as a mean to calm and reward myself of attention deprivations, perhaps. There is an urgent need to be humble and meek but even with God's help, it will not an over night effort; however, I do and I will try. My brother's heart has been very broken and perhaps his childhood times are as haunting as mine but with different problems altogether and for the most part, I believe I am the culprit of it all. 'If you break a vase, you should patch things up' is the thought that now constantly pounds my mind. I now feel the terrible qualms of my guilts expanding day by day; the more reasons for the need to patch things up. There can be no amount of apologies, perhaps, to forgive myself and hope things will be fine. But I need to stop living in my past and from this day forward I will make things new, with the strength of the Almighty and Holy Spirit.

        "blog_text": "Superman \nIf you were to look closely at one of my preschool pictures, you would notice that underneath the plaid, button-up, western style shirt that I am wearing, there is a light blue T. The casual observer might not find anything unusual about a young man with an undershirt, but ah….with a little imagination and a lot of squinting one may begin to see traces of a red, yellow, and blue seal on my chest. You see, from a very young age, I believed myself to be SUPERMAN! \nAs a young lad it was difficult to keep my identity under wraps. How can a child with wings not use them to fly? Consequently, I could be found soaring around my Grandmommy’s house, showing off my right bicep to anyone who would look my way. I was amusing and annoying I’m sure. \nMy beloved wife inaugurated the advent of my twenty-seventh year by throwing me a superman party. Among my gifts were DVD’s, superhero ornaments, a superhero cookie cake, and a brand new Superman T-shirt. She did this for obvious reasons. You see, I am Superman…..again. \nWarner Brothers released a new T.V show a few years ago that rekindled my love of the Superman story. Smallville focuses on The Man of Steel's early years. One finds Clark Kent, not in Metropolis, but in a small farm town. He’s not yet in tights, but is growing up, struggling with adolescence, and trying to find his identity. \nStrangely enough, as a three and four year old child, I found myself captivated by the thirty-year-old invincible man in tights, who flew around Metropolis saving the world from its most evil villains. But as a twenty-six year old man with a master’s degree, I am fascinated with the boy Kent. It’s his story that fills my heart with hope every Wednesday night at 9:00. \nThat last sentence just might disturb some of you. “Clark Kent fills your heart with hope?!?” What about Jesus?” Walk with me a moment. As young children we need super heroes. We want to believe that they exist and more importantly, that we could be one. They are beyond human. \nEvery morning as I look in the mirror, my humanity stares back at me. My hair is turning grey, my waistline can’t handle afternoon nachos anymore, and facial lines are beginning to form. Moreover, I am inwardly normal. If you were to open up the fleshly shell and peer deep into my soul, you would see only the ordinary. I am a man. There was a point in time when that reality seeped into me. At another point I began to embrace it. I count the latter point among the most profoundly transformative of my life. \nIn almost every episode, Clark Kent discovers something new about himself, something that most of us already knew. He can’t be hurt? He can see through walls? He can leap tall buildings in a single bound? Big deal – He’s Superman! The real story: He struggles with his parents. He breaks into a cold sweat every time he tries to share his feelings with Lana. He fights with his friends. He fails. He doesn’t know who he is, and what he does know, he can’t really share with anyone. He is trapped by his own giftedness. He is so much more than anyone knows, and so much less than anyone thinks. Clark Kent is my hero. \nThis is really the end of my thought, but I think that somehow, this thought shadows some of my feelings about Jesus. As I steadily approach my thirties, it comforts and inspires me to think of Jesus as human. I do not deny his divinity. I would never attempt to say that Clark Kent was not at the same time Superman, but again, what I'm finding more and more profound, is that Superman was always at the same time Clark Kent.

It's only Sanskrit-English, with no English-to-Sanskrit section, and all the Indic words are in the Devanagari script, which I do not read. By the typeface it looks to be an older book, possibly 19th century, originally published in India and reprinted in the 1990s in England. Still, it's fascinating, and I find myself sitting up at night, thumbing through it, scanning the columns of strange script and familiar definitions. A dictionary half in an unknown language is a fountain of inspiration. Delightful connections are expressed there, along with conceptions that convince me that, in ancient India, the world had a civilization that has hardly been matched in subtlety and sophistication. \nA man who does not cook for himself; a bad cook [a term of abuse]. A mouse; a miser. Licked; surrounded. \nA bee; a scorpion. A woman's female friend. A whirlpool, a crowded place. Inaccessible; unfit for sexual intercourse; difficult to understand. \nThere are whole sermons and life lessons in a single word: \nRepentance, intense enmity, close attachment. Fire; appetite; gold. A great danger; a desperate act. Supported; haughty; near; obstructed. Touched; violated; judged; endured. Relaxation; independence. \nThere are mysteries fit to be taken whole as a poem by Wallace Stevens or William Carlos Williams, or to inspire a Borges ficcione: \nA benediction; a serpent's fang. Homeless, imperishable. Ungovernable; necessary. Painting figures on the body; feathering an arrow. \nI meet words I wish I had; that is, words for which there is no single word in English that covers the same territory: \nPleasure arising from sympathy. One who has suppressed his tears. An illustration of a thing by its reverse. A practice not usually proper to the caste but allowable in time of distress. A figure of speech dependent on sense and not on sound.",

And I'm a loner too, just to add. I didn't want to stay in Chemistry another minute to WATCH people talk to each other as I'm antisocially in a corner. It is my fault that life is like this now, but I just don't feel right talking to people anymore. So 2 minutes before the bell rang, I walked out and went toward Sedgwick's. Bell rings, George walked by  'Someone got written up for ditching class...'  WHY DOES HE ALWAYS WIN?!?! And now, I've noticed that he tries to do this to me-- everything on purpose. He kept glaring at my drawing and then me, to piss me off. And what a coincidence, him and Chris just happened to end up sitting by me for the 3 hour AP hist test (which sucked and I probably failed it). Even Daniel acts different towards me now, I feel like he doesn't care anymore. Which is understandable, (Valerie) no one likes talking to her when she complains all the time, just as no one probably likes talking to me since I'm always unhappy and crying in class. I found something to distract me though, spinning my ruler around a pencil. I just keep repeating 'the pencil is strong, it keeps going, the ruler might distract it and bother it, but it keeps going.. have Strength. have strength.' And strangely enough, George kept trying to knock it off, how symbolic... Come to think of it, maybe that's why Ryan, Rachael and Brandon seem to be the only people that talk to me now, they don't see me in class when George is around. They see me after class and right when I feel like I'm on the verge of breaking down, they give a smile and make me feel like I matter. Thank you. What was really really weird, as soon as Alex Salazar sat himself between me and George, I felt happier, and I was talking again. I HATE GEORGE! I HATE HIM SO MUCH, it makes me sick. You'd think me saying that would have no meaning since I 'hated' Will last week and I talk to him now- But I know he's a patheologial liar, and there's nothing I can do but laugh about it. Ok, Chris did some slurping noise at me and I know its some inside joke but I don't know what it means, if anyone else knows, please tell me, cause it's bothering me that I don't get it. I hate inside jokes that involve me being laughed at. That's all that seems to happen now.         I went to Will's house today to work with Chris (Will's brother) it went well, he has a lot of ideas for my songs, and he said something that I can't seem to shrug off  'After high school sucks; you find out who your real friends are.'  that's sad.      Question: Does anyone else have an extreme discomfort with their door being open when talking on the phone or being online? For some reason, I can't stand being on the phone when I know people in my house can overhear my conversation. Just bothers me a lot. ----And I think a lot more people read this than I even knew of.

Went to sleep around 5 a.m. and was back up at 7. Trying to get ready for the hearing was no fun as I was very nervous. Should Beulah Gale go with or stay at home? Getting the kids ready for childcare (a very rare thing) and changing shirts a half dozen times. The day I have been waiting for over a year had finally arrived, and I am so nervous I cant sit still. It is a rainy and over cast day...Just like the day I was ran over... Once the kids are deposited, it is just she and I, as we drive to the big town...Small talk and little tidbits of encouragement from her from time to time. When we finally arrive and find a parking spot, she looks to me and asks, 'what will we do if we do not win?' I answer, 'I dont know.....We will win...' We finally make it to the third floor and find where we are to be, the security guard is most pleasant and appreciated for his attitude. Beulah Gale offers more encouragement and I am probably just as nervous as any time one of our children were born (at home). I try to pace, but forget that...The gimped are not very adept at pacing...So I hobble back and forth. The attorney finally arrives and tries to prepare me and I assure him I am ready, while mentally I am just about to flip! The rest of our lives will be decided within the space of an hour, and I am supposed to feel at ease! Where's my faith? It is finally D-day and 0 hour is here. The guard opens the door and out walks this woman who is mentally tried, and nothing can be found of any hope in her face, just confusion...Did she win or lose? It is evident that she will be waiting for quite awhile as the judge reviews her case and gives his decision at a later date. She is wearing a full back brace and has no answers. How in the world could I expect anything more than she has received? I dont look anywhere near as pitiful as she. Still I pray, 'Lord, I need to know today.' The guard takes our evidence and presents it to the judge for review as we all sit outside waiting. Will he decide to just throw the case completely out? Anxiety is soaring to greater heights as we wait. Now I dont want a decision at all! If only I could get the courage to leave....I dont want to face the judgment that would soon come, as it couldnt possibly turn out good. The guard leads us in. Once settled, the judge is very hospitable, yet I am so intimidated. Where's the tough guy who can get run over and laugh as the EMT's work on him? He is nowhere to be found, and somehow, I seem to escape with him...I am there answering questions about ability to work, degree of pain, education etc., etc., yet, it is as if I am viewing this like a television show. All was going well as I listened to the questions and my answers as a detatched observer, until one question was asked, 'How do you feel as a person, a husband, and father? How do you view yourself?' The 'me' on the stand starts out just fine, then suddenly 'I' the real person am thrown into the witness seat. No more hiding as the detatched person previously there doesnt know the answers! Why did my attorney have to ask this one question? The image of 'me' was doing just fine on his own, but now, I would have to address issues that I never knew existed, or rather, refused to realize were there. As I am under oath, there could no longer be any of those 'Super Ego, tough guy' answers, as I had hid from for many years, and somehow had even stopped them from invading any conscious realization. How did I feel? As I start to reveal them in a strong stance, my foundation quickly eludes me and I find myself crying like a baby as I have to admit the failure that has been hiding behind the smiles for so long. I was not the strong husband my wife deserves, nor was I the father who ran and played with his children. I did not make time for them as pain has a very greedy and needy price that demands payment. I am not a good provider and how can a man such as I am, be a good role model or adored husband. There it was! Sobbing and barely able to talk, I had to admit to being a total failure in life. Finally, once I am totally unable to speak anymore, I look around at my wife for help,I was so sorry that once again I had caused her pain as I see her crying also...There could be no help. After a minute of sobbing and silence, the judge finally interrupts with a swept down voice and says, 'I have enough medical evidence and the testimony doesnt need to go any farther, I have made a decision.' At this point I know he is going to deny the benefits to someone who just didnt try hard enough at life. He continues, 'I am going to write a positive letter of allowance for disability benefits.' I try to gather myself, apologize to the judge, and with the assistance of my wife and attorney, leave the room. They are both jubilant and I am just there. On the elevator down to the first floor the attorney says, 'I have sit in over a hundred hearings with this judge and this is the first time I have ever seen or heard of him giving a bench decision like this.' On the way home she is so happy, and I am still in shock. We decide to stop at a restaurant/diner, and talk in solitude for a little while. She was so excited that life could now go on, and I was still in shock from the revelations I had to discover and disclose about myself. The gravity of it all had not hit yet. We make it home and the kids are excited as it becomes very evident that all the worry we had been carrying, they had been sharing the load right along with us.

        "blog_text": "I just watched the movie Adaptation and I know I say this a lot, but that was the best movie I've seen in a long time. If you've seen it, the movie sort of writes itself as it goes and so I'll try to do that. So I watched the movie and came upstairs for dinner. As I sat there, eating dinner, staring down, my mom was barking into the phone next to me with some faraway relative of ours. It sounded important. I thought about how a movie about that important thing would work. About how he or she would be played and who would play them. I'd write the script I thought. But no, it would never work. These people wouldn't be able to appreciate a good movie like that. It just wouldn't work. Of course it was an obvious thing to me why it wouldn't work but then I tried to simplify it all so I could explain it to others. I suppose its because I'm foreign and all. Things like movies and movie scripts just don't fit into my world the way they do into the world of Charlie Kauffman. There's just that barrier that provides that medium of creative expression from pervading into our existence. Whatever that means. But back to me being foreign. Sometimes, I wish I weren't. It would make things like this easier. I would be go about doing these things in a much easier way. I'm not saying that I wish I was white or I wish I was black as so many fucked up youths believe. I just wish I wasn't different. It would be easier that way. I don't want the first thing that people think when they see me is 'he's brown'. I want to be appreciated and noticed for other things. Of course, I want to be different. I want to be set apart. But I don't want what sets me apart to be something beyond my choosing. Beyond my control. I want to individually determine my own methods of creative aesthetic expression; I want to dictate the way in which others percieve me. Not because I really care about how others percieve me but because I want to be able to define my own identity and because the culture we live in is so driven by the way we look, I want to control that. I don't want that to hinder me. Come to think of it, I don't want for myself to look different. I guess I don't want to change. I want others to change. I want society to change. Fuck then, I guess I'm screwed. This whole argument made a lot more sense when I thought about it. I bet if I explained it in speaking, where I wouldn't have to worry about all these annoying grammatical conventions and whatnot, it would've been easier. Well, then again, I would've sucked at explaining it to others because I would have constantly worried about how they percieved that last word or sentence I just said and as I got caught up in that, I'd stumble and mess up. That wouldn't be good. You know what I need? One of those handheld voice recorders. Like Charlie Kaufman. Yeah. Also, sometimes, when I tell people this, or tell people the thought that I (and pretty much every other young person thats struggling to find their identity or is struggling to creatively express themself) sometimes think I have thoughts more profound then others; thoughts that others may be incapable of percieving, they ask me if I've read the Catcher in the Rye. Some of the cleverer ones tell me that I've read Catcher in the Rye too many times. Well, thing is, I read the book a year and a half ago, and looking back at it, I don't think I 'got' it. In fact, I know I didn't get it. I think I need to read it again. Yeah, I'll read it again.",

        "blog_text": "Visited the Drexel in Bexley last night for a screening of a documentary on dietrich bonhoffer. Some interesting questions were raised on the relativity of ethics even in the kingdom of God.   How can bonhoffer, a christian pastor, plot to murder anyone. And  was he ever completely settled in his own decision to do so?  Moral relativism is a slippery slope to say the least. History has proven Hitler to be one of the most maniacal regimes of our time, and yet so much of the church just folded into his ideology for a new germany. Humans are bent toward evil, so, in my mind, many jumps toward moral relativism in given situations are most likely motivated from evil, and wanting to withdraw from authority rather than benevolence.   If almost the whole german church can be duped by a man who confesses an ideological God (I admit, it did make me think of bush for a moment), then who's to say that I am not duping myself simply in a slightly different direction, by plotting to kill the man who does such things.   This answer keeps getting to be more of a cop out every time I use it. And in this situation i especially don't like what i am about to suggest. Yet, it seems that it all comes down to what God is leading His sheep (you know, the ones who ACTUALLY know His voice, and ACTUALLY follow Him) to do.   To be convinced in ones own mind that God is 'on my side' is foolish and common. For a community to be convinced is slightly more dangerous and also comforting as you are not acting alone. For a nation, in it's own mind to be convinced that God is on their side almost certainly leads to war.  But you cant dismantle an argument based on its possible dangerous effects or abuses.   I don't know if I agree with what Bonhoffer was doing in his attempt to assassinate Hitler. But I'm not sure that bonhofffer agreed with himself half the time either. I sure wouldn't want to see a few people in my homegroup (or lets be honest, i would feel  uncomfortable with myself absolutely) taking liberties in proportion to assassination  based on what either myself or my immediate community or my nation believed.   On a related note, tonight i think i'm teaching a good old fashioned message of repentance at homegroup.

        "blog_text": "Western Values And Eastern Challenges  - NR Narayana Murthy\nCame Across this Interesting Article on the web. For a Generation which feels Confused between Western Values & Eastern Challenges , this article might prove to be an eye-opener . It also proves there is much more to West than just MTV & Paparazzi . \nAs it is said in the Vedas: Man can live individually, but can survive only collectively. Hence, our challenge is to form a progressive community by balancing the interests of the individual and that of the society. To meet this we need to develop a value system where people accept modest sacrifices for the common good. \nA value system is the protocol for behaviour that enhances the trust, confidence and commitment of members of the community. It goes beyond the domain of legality - It is about decent and desirable behaviour. Further, it includes putting the community interests ahead of your own. Thus, our collective survival and progress is predicated on sound values. \nThere are two pillars of the cultural value system - loyalty to family and loyalty to community. One should not be in isolation to the other, because, successful societies are those which combine both harmoniously. It is in this context that I will discuss the role of Western values in contemporary Indian society. \nAs an Indian, I am proud to be part of a culture, which has deep-rooted family values. We have tremendous loyalty to the family. For instance, parents make enormous sacrifices for their children. They support them until they can stand on their own feet. On the other side, children consider it their duty to take care of aged parents. We believe: 'Mathru devo bhava, pithru devo bhava' (Mother is God and Father is God). Further, brothers and sisters sacrifice for each other. In fact, the eldest brother or sister is respected by all the other siblings. \nAs for marriage, it is held to be a sacred union - husband and wife are bonded, most often, for life. In joint families, the entire family works towards the welfare of the family. There is so much love and affection in our family life. This is the essence of Indian values and one of our key strengths. \nOur families act as a critical support mechanism for us. In fact, the credit to the success of Infosys goes, as much to the founders as to their families, for supporting them through the tough times. Unfortunately, our attitude towards family life is not reflected in our attitude towards community behaviour. From littering the streets to corruption to breaking of contractual obligations, we are apathetic towards the common good. \nThe primary difference between the West and us is that, there, people have a much better societal orientation. In the West - the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand - individuals understand that they have to be responsible towards their community. They care more for the society than we do. Further, they generally sacrifice more for the society than us. Quality of life is enhanced because of this.This is where we need to learn form the West. \nConsider some of the lessons that we Indians can learn from the West: \nRespect for the public good - In the West, there is respect for the public good. For instance, parks free of litter, clean streets, public toilets free of graffiti - all these are instances of care for the public good.  On the contrary, in India, we keep our houses clean and water our gardens everyday but, when we go to a park, we do not think twice before littering the place. \nAttitude to corruption - This is because of the individual's responsible behaviour towards the community as a whole. On the contrary, in India, corruption, tax evasion, cheating and bribery have eaten into our vitals. For instance, contractors bribe officials, and construct low-quality roads and bridges.  Corruption, as we see in India, is another example of putting the interest of oneself, and at best that of one's family, above that of the society.  Society is relatively corruption free in the West. It is very difficult to bribe a police officer into avoiding a speeding ticket. The result is that society loses in the form of substandard defence equipment and infrastructure, and low-quality recruitment, just to name a few impediments. Unfortunately, this behaviour is condoned by almost everyone. \nPublic apathy - Apathy in solving community matters has held us back from making progress, which is otherwise within our reach. We see serious problems around us but do not try to solve them. We behave as if the problems do not exist or are somebody else's. On the other hand, in the West, people solve societal problems proactively. \nThere are several examples of our apathetic attitude. \n(i) For instance, all of us are aware of the problem of drought in India. More than 40 years ago, Dr KL Rao - an irrigation expert, suggested creation of a water grid connecting all the rivers in North and South India, to solve this problem. Unfortunately, nothing has been done about this. \n(ii) The story of power shortage in Bangalore is another instance. In 1983, it was decided to build a thermal power plant to meet Bangalore's power requirements. Unfortunately, we have still not started it. \n(iii) The Milan subway in Bombay is in a deplorable state for the past 40 years, and no action has been taken. \nTo quote another example, considering the constant travel required in the software industry; five years ago, I had suggested a 240-page passport. This would eliminate frequent visits to the passport office. In fact, we are ready to pay for it. However, I am yet to hear from the ministry of external affairs on this. We, Indians, would do well to remember Thomas Hunter's words: Idleness travels very slowly, and poverty soon overtakes it. \nWhat could be the reason for this? We were ruled by foreigners for over thousand years. Thus, we have always believed that public issues belonged to some foreign ruler and that we have no role in solving them. Moreover, we have lost the will to proactively solve our own problems and have got used to just executing someone else's orders. \nBorrowing Aristotle's words: 'We are what we repeatedly do.' Thus, having done this over the years, the decision-makers in our society are not trained for solving problems. Our decision-makers look to somebody else to take decisions. Unfortunately, there is nobody to look up to, and this is the tragedy. \nOur intellectual arrogance has also not helped our society. I have travelled extensively, and in my experience, have not come across another society where people are as contemptuous of better societies as we are, with as little progress as we have achieved. Remember that arrogance breeds hypocrisy. \nNo other society gloats so much about the past as we do, with as little current accomplishment. Friends, this is not a new phenomenon, but at least a thousand years old. For instance, Al Barouni, the famous Arabic logician and traveller of the 10th century, who spent about 30 years in India from 997 AD to around 1027 AD, referred to this trait of Indians. \nAccording to him, during his visit, most Indian pundits considered it below their dignity even to hold arguments with him. In fact, on a few occasions when a pundit was willing to listen to him, and found his arguments to be very sound, he invariably asked Barouni: which Indian pundit taught these smart things! \nThe most important attribute of a progressive society is respect for others who have accomplished more than they themselves have, and learn from them. Contrary to this, our leaders make us believe that other societies do not know anything! \nAt the same time, everyday, in the newspapers, you will find numerous claims from our leaders that ours is the greatest nation. This has to stop. These people would do well to remember Thomas Carlyle's words: The greatest of faults is to be conscious of none.' \nIf we have to progress, we have to change this attitude, listen to people who have performed better than us, learn from them and perform better than them. Infosys is a good example of such an attitude. \nWe continue to rationalise our failures. No other society has mastered this art as well as we have. Obviously, this is an excuse to justify our incompetence, corruption, and apathy. This attitude has to change. As Sir Josiah Stamp has said: 'It is easy to dodge our responsibilities, but we cannot dodge the consequences of dodging our responsibilities.' \nAnother interesting attribute, which we Indians can learn from the West, is their accountability. Irrespective of your position, in the West, you are held accountable for what you do. However, in India, the more 'important' you are, the less answerable you are. \nFor instance, a senior politician once declared that he 'forget' to file his tax returns for 10 consecutive years - and he got away with it. To quote another instance, there are over 100 loss-making public sector units in India. Nevertheless, I have not seen action taken for bad performance against top managers in these organisations. \nIn the West, each person is proud about his or her labour that raises honest sweat. On the other hand, in India, we tend to overlook the significance of those who are not in professional jobs. We have a mindset that reveres only supposedly intellectual work. For instance, I have seen many engineers, fresh from college, who only want to do cutting-edge work and not work that is of relevance to business and the country. \nHowever, be it an organisation or society, there are different people performing different roles. For success, all these people are required to discharge their duties. This includes everyone from the CEO to the person who serves tea - every role is important. Hence, we need a mindset that reveres everyone who puts in honest work. \nIndians become intimate even without being friendly. They ask favors of strangers without any hesitation. For instance, the other day, while I was travelling from Bangalore to Mantralayam, I met a fellow traveller on the train. Hardly five minutes into the conversation, he requested me to speak to his MD about removing him from the bottom 10 per cent list in his company, earmarked for disciplinary action. \nI was reminded of what Rudyard Kipling once said: A westerner can be friendly without being intimate while an easterner tends to be intimate without being friendly. \nYet another lesson to be learnt from the West, is about their professionalism in dealings. The common good being more important than personal equations, people do not let personal relations interfere with their professional dealings. For instance, they don't hesitate to chastise a colleague, even if he is a personal friend, for incompetent work. \nIn India, I have seen that we tend to view even work interactions from a personal perspective. Further, we are the most 'thin-skinned' society in the world - we see insults where none is meant. This may be because we were not free for most of the last thousand years. \nFurther, we seem to extend this lack of professionalism to our sense of punctuality. We do not seem to respect the other person's time. The Indian Standard Time somehow seems to be always running late. Moreover, deadlines are typically not met. How many public projects are completed on time? \nThe disheartening aspect is that we have accepted this as the norm rather than an exception. Meritocracy by definition means that we cannot let personal prejudices affect our evaluation of an individual's performance. As we increasingly start to benchmark ourselves with global standards, we have to embrace meritocracy. \nIn the West, right from a very young age, parents teach their children to be independent in thinking. Thus, they grow up to be strong, confident individuals. In India, we still suffer from feudal thinking. I have seen people, who are otherwise bright, refusing to show independence and preferring to be told what to do by their boss. We need to overcome this attitude if we have to succeed globally. \nThe Western value system teaches respect to contractual obligation. In the West, contractual obligations are seldom dishonoured. This is important - enforceablity of legal rights and contracts is the most important factor in the enhancement of credibility of our people and nation. \nIn India, we consider our marriage vows as sacred. We are willing to sacrifice in order to respect our marriage vows. However, we do not extend this to the public domain. For instance, India had an unfavourable contract with Enron. Instead of punishing the people responsible for negotiating this, we reneged on the contract - this was much before we came to know about the illegal activities at Enron. \nTo quote another instance, I had given recommendations to several students for the national scholarship for higher studies in US universities. Most of them did not return to India even though contractually they were obliged to spend five years after their degree in India. \nIn fact, according to a professor at a reputed US university, the maximum default rate for student loans is among Indians - all of these students pass out in flying colours and land lucrative jobs, yet they refuse to pay back their loans. Thus, their action has made it difficult for the students after them, from India, to obtain loans. \nFurther, we Indians do not display intellectual honesty. For example, our political leaders use mobile phones to tell journalists on the other side that they do not believe in technology! If we want our youngsters to progress, such hypocrisy must be stopped. \nWe are all aware of our rights as citizens. Nevertheless, we often fail to acknowledge the duty that accompanies every right. To borrow Dwight Eisenhower's words: 'People that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both.' \nOur duty is towards the community as a whole, as much as it is towards our families. We have to remember that fundamental social problems grow out of a lack of commitment to the common good. To quote Henry Beecher: Culture is that which helps us to work for the betterment of all. \nHence, friends, I do believe that we can make our society even better by assimilating these Western values into our own culture - we will be stronger for it. Most of our behaviour comes from greed, lack of self-confidence, lack of confidence in the nation, and lack of respect for the society. \nTo borrow Gandhi's words: There is enough in this world for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed. Let us work towards a society where we would do unto others what we would have others do unto us. Let us all be responsible citizens who make our country a great place to live. \nIn the words of Winston Churchill, 'Responsibility is the price of greatness.' We have to extend our family values beyond the boundaries of our home. Let us work towards maximum welfare of the maximum people - 'Samasta janaanaam sukhino bhavantu'. \nFinally, let us of this generation, conduct ourselves as great citizens rather than just good people so that we can serve as good examples for our younger generation. \nThank you. \n(Excerpts from a lecture delivered by NR Narayana Murthy, Chairmain of Infosys Technologies Ltd., at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management, New Delhi, India on October 1st, 2002).",

        "blog_text": "Al Qaeda and the Kingdom of God \n\nThe other day I read an article which said that an Al Qaeda spokesperson had come forward saying that Americans should expect more attacks; in fact, an attack so horrendous, it would make us forget about 9/11.  Let me just get honest.  Anger flooded me.  I cursed Al Qaeda over and over in my head and heart.  F#&% them!  I thought to myself.    Then I remembered our Lords words, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.  What?!?!  How am I, a broken, angry, sinful person supposed to do that? Loving the people of Al Qaeda feels downright impossible.  But if I am to be obedient to Jesus, who prayed, Father forgive them for His enemies, I must.  A friend of mine pointed out that it soon becomes impossible to hate someone whom you are constantly praying for.  Love is the fruit of God injecting His forgiveness and mercy into us.  I cannot love fundamentalist terrorists on my own; but God can, and if I will pray for them and seek Him, by His grace I will be enabled and empowered to love my enemies.  The solution is not to nuke some country or some political hotspot.  The solution is not to hunt down and slit the throats of all terrorists everywhere.  As long as we live in a fallen world, there will always be terrorists, there will always be wars, and there will always be sin.  The real battle is not the War On Terror.  The real battle is the battle for the kingdom of God.    \n\nIn Dallas Willards book, The Divine Conspiracy, he comments on the kingdom:  Now Gods own kingdom or rule, is the range of his effective will, where what he wants done is done.  The person of God himself and the action of his will are the organizing principles of his kingdom, but everything that obeys those principlesis within his kingdomSo when Jesus directs us to pray, Thy kingdom come, he does not mean we should pray for it to come into existence.  Rather, we pray for it to take over at all points in the personal, social, and political order where it is now excluded: On earth as it is in heaven.  Our limited point of view, based on our experiential (yet finite) knowledge of time, history, existence, society, and God cannot perceive with absolute clarity the rightness, justness, and goodness of God in the face of events like 9/11.  Let me show you what I mean.  Solomon, the wisest man to ever live bemoaned the futility of life in Ecclesiastes.  There is futility which is done on the earth, that is, there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked.  On the other hand, there are evil men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous.  I say that this too is futility  It is the same for all.  There is one fate for the righteous and for the wicked  This is an evil that is done under the sun, that there is one fate for all men.  Furthermore, the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil and insanity is in their hearts throughout their lives.  Afterwards they go to the dead.  - Ecclesiastes 8:14, 9:2, 3      Solomon perceived that life can be a very frustrating, confusing, and seemingly futile experience.  Certainly, if life under the sun is all there is to life, it does seem to be a cosmic joke; an ironic, meaningless little blip on the screen of the history of the universe.  But though we may live in a broken and fallen world full of broken and fallen people, and though life under the sun may be unfair and unjust, Gods kingdom is stealthily infiltrating the lives and habitats of those who will seek Him.    \n\nWhat we see on the news will most likely not aid us in realizing this.  Believing that there is a good and just God on the throne and that He is even now establishing His rule amongst us requires faith  the assurance of things hoped for.  By faith we believe that God is not powerless or heartless or aloof, but a Rewarder of those who seek Himabundant in loving-kindness to all who call on Himgood to those who wait for Him, to the person who seeks Him.  Its true King will one day flip this crazy, war-ridden world on its head.  The lion will lie down with the lamb, Israelis will embrace Arabs, terror will be no more, and peace will reign forever.    \n\nBut until that day, this is our battle: the battle for the kingdom.  If I want peace and justice in this world, I start with myself, by submitting to Gods rule in my own life, my own struggles.  I allow Him to conquer my anger and fear.

        "blog_text": "Me! I'm Michelle, thirty-one years old as of July 2002. Before I say one word about myself, please refer to my all-time favorite quote: 'Do I contradict myself? Very well, then - I contradict myself. I am large, I contain multitudes.' - Walt Whitman. Now that you've heard my disclaimer, we can proceed.  I hate attaching one-dimensional terminology to myself so early on, but here's a brief summary:   I am increasingly conservative with age, anti-abortion, pro-death penalty (Whoops! Not any more! See November 2002), pro-firearms. Are you a raging liberal? You'll find little to feel warm and fuzzy about here. However, I am utterly stumped by anyone who pledges blind and unwavering allegiance to any political party. I vote all over the map.   I am a hard-core environmentalist and consider recycling and composting among my favorite hobbies. I am an animal-lover who has tried many times to go vegetarian, but failed miserably.   I am a practicing Catholic who returned to the poor parish of my childhood and I relish the community I've found there. I was chosen to sit on Parish Council this year and joked that they should really perform background checks on people before they go nominating people willy-nilly like that.   I have an utterly filthy mouth and am trying hard to curb my colorful euphemisms - but you will surely see them peppered throughout here. If profanity offends you, move on.   I am a rabid fan of Donald Roller Wilson's artwork (www.donaldrollerwilson.com) and hope one day to be able to afford one of his prints. I love anything from the Modernism movement from the 1950s. Our house is a great example of Frank Lloyd Wright's Usonia concept. It's amazing - a real one-of-a-kind. We bought it directly from the original owners a year after I wrote them a letter, asking them to keep us in mind should they ever decide to sell. They did, and we are the proud caretakers of this strange time capsule of a home. It has a flat roof, original cork tiles on the floors, and no painted surfaces in the house - it's all brick, rare wood veneers or glass walls. The ceilings are all tongue-in-groove slats crossed by giant redwood beams. Barring any major lottery wins, they will carry me out of this house in a body bag before I ever move.  I knit and draw and write, both professionally and for pleasure, as hobbies. I used to work for one of the Big Three automakers but left after several years of disgust and drudgery. I took a year off, began to work at my vet clinic for fun and promptly got pregnant. It was the only job I have ever truly loved. I have degrees in Business Administration (the great 'get-a-job-for-sure' catchall degree) and Spanish. If I had it to do over again, I don't know what I'd study, but it surely wouldn't be that.  I share my life with:  Eugene, my dear husband of seven years as of June 2002, thirty-one years old as of February 2002. He is one stellar human being and I aspire to be more like him with each passing year. He is patient, kind, honest, compassionate and hard-working. I've been with him since October of 1989, when he was a freshman in college and I was a sophomore. He was so cute that I hunted him down like a coon dog and I've been in love ever since. He wore a Morris The Cat watch that his mom had gotten for him by mailing in cat food labels and I knew he was the one for me.  Henry, our first child. Born in December of 2001, he is the light of our lives. At nearly eight months old at the time of writing, he amazes and delights me every day. He is an incredibly pleasant child, with a great sense of humor and a streak of determination a mile wide. For many years, I thought I would be childfree for life - but then I read Danielle Crittendon's 'What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us' and I changed my mind completely. I stay at home full-time to care for Henry, and I look forward to having more children.  Rolf and Theo, our two fawn male Great Danes. These are cherished pooches, let me tell you. Rolf suffers from Wobbler's Syndrome (a spinal compression condition that limits his mobility), diabetes and bi-lateral cataracts stemming from the diabetes. He was five in July of 2002, and this summer will be his last. His health has been declining for some time, and we don't want to put him through another winter. Of late, I cry nightly over our impending loss. Theo, on the other hand, is absurdly healthy. He was four as of May 2002, and he is fat and sassy. And I do mean fat - he gained fifty pounds this year to top the scales at nearly 184 pounds! But he is also incredibly muscular and not a canine with which to mess. The UPS man nearly wets his pants every time he has to drop something off at the door and sees Theo going ballistic on the other side of the door. Theo's diet commences as soon as our insulin-dependent Rolf passes away - we have to keep food available at all times for Rolfie-roo.   Claude and Dodi, our feline brother and sister mischief team. The only cats I've ever known to come when called to both family and complete strangers. Claude, in particular, is well-known as a kitty-whore to our buddies at the vet clinic for his outrageously affectionate temperament. Dodi is every bit as sweet, but she has an - ahem -inappropriate elimination problem. Which is to say that every now and then she pees somewhere that's dreadfully inconvenient. Our interim solution is to keep Dodi largely sequestered.   Let's see - what else should you know, going in? I have some reservations about keeping this journal and deciding with whom to share it, among people I know in 'real' life. I'd like to be able to write honestly about everything, but I wonder about the wisdom of doing so, given the likelihood that someone, at some point, will discover that I keep this journal and want to read it. I'm still working this out as I go along.  So, let's get started, shall we?",

A few years back I was at a very terrible crossroad that could have led me into a lot of trouble. Luckily I chose the straight and sober path and am now the strong person I am today.  At the age of 13, the past started haunting me and the sexual abuse was being thought about. Being so young and niave, I had thought it was partially my fault. Like any other victim of sexual abuse, I started blaming it on myself.   Luckilly I have very supportive parents that care about me in an enormous way. I fortunately disclosed to them what had happened to me when I was a toddler.  As you are probably aware I am the eldest of five children. I have one sister who is now 11 years old and three brothers, ages 9, 13 and 21. If it wasn't for my little sister disclosing her abuse at the tender age of 2, I don't think I would have dealt with mine, even to this very day.  My sister was just learning how to talk at the time and was a very expressive little girl. I fealt like a piece of shit when she disclosed. I felt that if I had brought up the fact to my parents, she could have been protected. But I can not cry over spilled milk and always blame myself. The past can not be changed, only the future can be well thought out.  So once I hit puberty, the shit kind of hit the fan, so to speak. I was so fucked up from the abuse, my mind was everywhere.  I have to admit that I got into quite a bit of trouble as a teenager. I was an unfortunate follower. I am sure glad that today I am more of a leader and have a mind of my own.  I never did like alcohol, until I turned 19. At that time life was one big party. I must have partied for two years straight. I met the wrong people, got introduced to hard drugs and life was a downward spiral from there.  At 21 I met someone who was going through the same transition I was. We helped eachother stay straight and sober. We maintained fulltime jobs and kept busy. But as lovers, we were not meant to be.  I feel that I successfully combatted the drug addiction and alcohol abuse, but he still had his weak moments. One giant weak moment ruined our entire relationship.  In May of 2002, my Father and I had moved to Northern BC. My mother, former boyfriend and the rest of the family had stayed behind in Powell River to finish the school year and finish up at his job.   Within 24 hours of my departure, he had gotten drunk at a campsite, on a logging road and totaled MY car. After that, I had no respect for him whatsoever. Why should I give him respect when he obviously had none for me? But I was attached and still cared for him in a slight way. I cared about his future. I cared that he had made it far and knew he had potential to make it farther. We were both enrolled in a welding program for September of 2002. Therefor, just because we were breaking up, I didn't feel he should put his plans on hold or scrap them all together. So he still proceeded to move up here and get on track.   In the meantime Kendall and I grew very close. Kendall was now my best friend and no one was going to get in our way. So I enrolled in a welding program at a different campus and moved in with him.  The ex started school as well, but his true colors shined through and he ended up dropping out and eventually moving back down south.  I was actually glad he moved, because like usual, I blamed myself for his unsuccessfulness. I had it in my head that, IF I didn't break up with him, he would be doing better today. But I have learned that I have no control over other people's lives and never to blame myself for others' actions.",

Still have to go to dentist RE: ground down tooth that requires root canal due to bruxhism.  Have to go to eye doctor.  Have to go to 'ladies' doctor.  Have zero insurance (i know i'm a walking accident waiting to happen).  And now I need a new computer because the one we have is a piece of shit and the school's computer is, apparently, on its last legs.  Plus we have to find a new apartment because the place we have now is falling down around us.

And how can the GKAP, which we have just finished the second round of, be almost completely empty?   Students who enter kindergarten in GA are tested individually during three windows, beginning middle and end of the year. We just tested for the middle, which included items like sorting shapes, blending sounds etc.  When I confronted Ms. SAT she said, I didn't know. Even though she had come into my class in the middle of the day last month (as usual!) and asked me what those numbers on the assessment guideline meant. And even though I told her that meant those were the items to test.  So now NONE of her kids have been tested. I think the sad thing is, those tests are meant to help you understand what you need to re-teach or emphasize in terms of skills. And even if she had tested, she wouldn't use those tests for that information. In a way I don't want to go to the principal because she's probably already fired, due to her poor overall performance. But in another way I feel like I need to bust her ass for being so stinky (both literally and figuratively.)  I can understand why people feel sorry for her, and why she feels sorry for herself.

        "blog_text": "Okay, here's something out of ZAMM. It all started with his son asking him if he believed in ghosts.  It's completely natural to think of Europeans who believed in ghosts or Indians who believed in ghost as ignorant. The scientific point of view has wiped out every other view to a point where they all seem primitive, so that if a person today talks about ghosts or spirits he is considered ignorant or maybe nutty. It's just all but completely impossible to imagine a world where ghosts can actually exist. My own opinion is that the intellect of modern man isn't that superior. IQ's aren't that much different. Those Indians and medieval men were just as intelligent as we are, but the context in which they thought was completely different. Within that context of thought, ghosts and spirits are quite as real as atoms, particles, photons and quants are to modern man. In that sense I believe in ghosts. Modern man has his ghosts and spirits too, you know. Oh, the laws of physics and of logic...the number system...the principle of algebraic substitution. These are ghosts. We just believe in them so thoroughly they seem real. For example, it seems completely natural to presume that gravitation and the law of gravitation existed before Isaac Newton. It would sound nutty to think that until the 17th century there was no gravity. So when did this law start? Has it always existed? What I am driving at is the notion that before the beginning of the earth, before the sun and the stars were formed, before the primal generation of anything, the law of gravity existed. Sitting there, having no mass of its own, no energy of its own, not in anyone's mind because there wasn't anyone not in space because there was no space either, not anywhere--this law of gravity still existed? If that law of gravity existed, I honestly don't know what thing has to do to be nonexistent. It seems to me that law of gravity has passed every test of nonexistence there is. You cannot think of a single attribute of nonexistence that that law of gravity didn't have. Or a single scientific attribute of existence it did have. And yet it is still 'common sense' to believe that it existed. Well, I predict that if you think about it long enough you will find yourself going round and round and round and round until you find you finally reach one possible, rational, intelligent conclusion. The law of gravity and gravity itself did not exist before Isaac Newton. No other conclusion makes sense. And what that means is that that law of gravity exists nowhere except in people's heads. It's a ghost! We are all of us very arrogant and conceited about running down other people's ghosts but just as ignorant and barbaric and superstitious about our own. Why does everybody believe in the law of gravity then? Mass hypnosis. In a very orthodox form known as 'education.' You've heard of the importance of eye contact in the classroom? Every educationist emphasizes it. No educationist explains it. We believe the disembodied words of Sir Isaac Newton were sitting in the middle of nowhere billions of years before he was born and that magically he discovered these words. They were always there, even when they applied to nothing. Gradually the world came into being and then they applied to it. In fact, those words themselves were that formed the world. That is ridiculous. The problem, the contradiction the scientists are stick with, is that of mind. Mind has no matter or energy but they can't escape its predominance over everything they do. Logic exists in the mind. Numbers exist only in the mind. I don't get upset when scientists say that ghosts exist in the mind. it's that only that gets me. Science is only in your mind too, it's just that that doesn't make it bad. Or ghosts either. Laws of nature are human inventions, like ghosts. Laws of logic, of mathematics are also human inventions, like ghosts. The whole blessed thing is a human invention, including the existence whatsoever outside the human imagination. It's all a ghost, and in antiquity was so recognized as a ghost, the whole blessed world we live in. It's run by ghosts of Moses and Christ and the Buddha, and Plato, and Descartes, and Rousseau and Jefferson and Lincoln, on and on and on. Isaac Newton is a very good ghost. One of the best. Your common sense is nothing more than the voices of thousands and thousands of these ghosts from the past. Ghosts and more ghosts. Ghosts trying to find their place among the living. Because of copyright laws I have to say that none of this is mine, I'm not taking credit for it. It was written by Robert M. Pirsig, none of it being my words, all his own. It's a good book.",

        "blog_text": "Julian Cope may well be the only antiquarian researcher to have appeared on Top of the Pops while stoned on acid. He talks to John Vidal about why we venerate landscape, the politics of heritage, shamanism, and the prehistoric nature of football worship. \nJulian Cope, a middle-aged man wearing a baseball cap, is sitting under a great oak at Avebury, one of Britain's finest megalithic sites, holding forth on what makes a place hallowed. There are, he says, tens of thousands of stone circles, dolmans, amphitheatres and monuments, but these are mere pointers. 'The sacred landscape is everywhere,' he says. 'Britain's ancientness shocks me. It's all there, just below the surface. You can peel it away like the skin of an onion.' \nCope is an expert on stone circles, but he's not your average antiquarian researcher. Rock star, self-styled shaman and goddess worshipper, his conversation roams from druids ('an elite bunch of control freaks') to planning policy (he calls for a new era of megalith-building in Britain).One minute he is learnedly discussing alignments of stones with a passer-by, the next he's leaping around imitating a horned God. The heritage industry, environmentalism, prehistoric culture and the goalkeeper-as-shaman are all on his idiosyncratic agenda. \nPlaces can be both modern and sacred, he ruminates. The best examples are Avebury, Stonehenge, and especially Glastonbury, where people today still go to from the city in an updated version of western worship. But the examples are not exclusively ancient. St Paul's cathedral in London is sacred - though the technological age, embodied in the modern city buildings that surround it and dominate it, has sapped some of its power. The Twin Towers of New York, Cope argues, represented a sacred landscape for Americans. Each culture, he suggests, can make its own temples. \nCope is singular. He was the lead singer of post-punk indie band, The Teardrop Explodes, who shone brilliantly for a couple of amphetamine-fuelled years in the early 1980s. He became a cult solo rocker, and author of two critically-acclaimed volumes of autobiography. He may, too, be the only bona fide antiquarian researcher to have performed on Top of the Pops while on acid, and to have posed naked (for an album cover) beneath the shell of a giant turtle. \nMore recently, he gave two talks at the British Museum about the norse divinity Odin - an occasion noted for his appearance in five-inch platform shoes and the fact that his hairspray forced the evacuation of the building after setting off fire alarms. \nHe plays the fool, but he certainly isn't one. Four years ago, his eight-year study of the ancient sites of Britain, The Modern Antiquarian, did as much as a thousand archaeologists and academics to drag late-prehistoric megalithic cultural studies into the present. It sold more than 40,000 copies in hardback and won the respect of many of Britain's leading researchers. What impressed the academics was not just the fact that, unlike them, he had the time and money to visit almost every one of the hundreds of sites that litter Britain, but that the infectious enthusiasm and knowledge of this errant, sometimes absurd, genius was filled with the kind of insights that could never come from the mainstream. \nCope may follow a long and honourable line of 18th- and 19th-century amateur antiquarians who meticulously recorded ancient sites and tried to interpret pre-history, but his take is equally informed by rock 'n' roll, and his experience of wildness and shamanism. \nThe megalith builders, he says, were these islands' first settlers, and humanity's first known monument builders. Their urge to mark the environment they lived in with monuments came out of reverence for the sun and the moon, but also, he says, from the deep and abiding urge to make human significance from land scape - something which, he says, still deeply informs the British, who venerate both landscape and the past more than in any other country in Europe. \n'The stones and circles of Britain are absolutely central to who we are today,' he says. 'They have defined and shaped our society. Our understanding of them makes us who we are. It shapes us, enriches our culture, and allows us to reflect on our own obsessions.' \nA few weeks ago, he visited the small Nine Ladies stone circle in the Peak District national park, just a few hundred yards from where a quarry company plans to extract millions of tonnes of stone. On one level, he says, he was shocked by the threatened disturbance and the 'fucked up' quarriers; but he was also heartened by the intuitive defence of the stones by a group of protesters who have been camped in the woods nearby for more than three years. \nCope, an evironmentalist, is no stranger to protest, notably at the Newbury bypass, where he donned the white hats of the roadbuilders and started ordering around the security guards. But the Nine Ladies protest at Stanton Lees also made him think about how the British have, almost uniquely, held on to their past. He has just finished a massive book on the ancient cultures of Europe, visiting more than 400 sites - from the temple circles of Ireland to the stone boats of Scandinavia and the megaliths of Armenia and the Mediterranean. He found many in a sorry state, un appreciated or even knocked down. 'We dont know how blessed we are with our monuments,' he says. 'In some places in Iberia, you have to wade through human excrement to reach rock-cut tombs.' Moreover, there is little study being done. Even though the earliest neolithic settlers [in Crete] were the originators of the Greek myths, little is known about them. \nThe significance of the stones in Britain, he suggets, is not dissimilar to what it was thousands of years ago. 'The Peak District national park is now a vast sanctuary for the hundreds of thousands of people who live near it, just as in the past the megalith builders turned the whole area into a huge limestone sanctuary reflecting the monumental landscape.' \nWe should, he says, think differently about landscape today, not be so precious about monuments, and think about using it to reflect our own age and obsessions. \n'My idea of beauty is first based on what I know about it, and then on what it looks like,' Cope says. 'Perhaps we should set windfarms up in lines or in circles. Let's be monumental about them.' Giant sculptures such as the Angel of the North come, he says, from the same urge to give meaning to place. \nThe heritage conservation industry is, he suggests, overprotective. He would see nothing wrong with people today re-erecting fallen monuments, or even re-arranging the stones, just as the megalith builders themselves thought nothing about dismantling some structures, carting them off to make new monuments and changing their significance according to the needs of the times. \nHe deplores the kind of insensitive roadbuilding seen at Stonehenge or Newbury, which can carelessly destroy ancient landscapes, yet he is no lover of the government's obsessive protectionism that lists up to 400,000 buildings and preserves landscapes in aspic as some kind of romanticisation. 'Often, it's for no other reason than that something is old,' he says. 'That's got to be total bullshit. Something is only beautiful because of what it stands for. Some of our destroyed castles are symbolic of terrible things, and are a mess. Why preserve the Byker estate in Newcastle? It's a monument to suffering.' \nOne of the roles of the modern rock star, he suggests, is to be the shaman in society, opening the doors of the 'underground'. 'It's as close to the shaman's contribution in prehistoric society as you can possibly get,' he argues. 'The shaman beating on the rotten log in Cheddar Gorge would have used the stack of speakers today. I see myself as a shaman. We have this idea that the shaman was insane, but I think he filtered through all society. You have always have to have people howling at the moon.' \nWe are much closer to our ancient roots than we might think, he says. 'Jim Morrison was probably the first to recognise the role of the rock 'n' roller as shaman,' Cope says. 'It was the Doors' epics, such as The End and When the Music's Over, that tipped the audience into the magical netherworld of ritual death and resurrection. Even a really shit band in a youth club has a barbarian eloquence. It's a religion substitute.' \nHe sees echoes of prehistory cultures in everything. 'Look at football worship,' he says. 'All those people gathered in an unroofed stadium [is] not unlike what must have gone on in pagan sanctuaries. The goalkeeper is the ultimate shaman, guarding the gates to the underground, wearing the No 1 jersey in a different colour and not seeming to be part of the team. We've never lost it. Modern beliefs that we are at the tail end of a culture that is killing itself is just bollocks.' \nWhat of today's archaeologists, picking away at our past? 'They're like fucking mystics,' he says. He loves and respects them, but cannot help winding them up. 'I went down to one site wearing my Archbishop Makarios hat. 'I'm here to declaim loudly,' I said. 'You spend 16 hours a day pissing around in the wind and the rain. If that's not mystic, what is?' \n'I think it's essential there's someone like me, if only to wind them up. I'm past the stage of trying to theorise about these places. I know what I believe, but I'm more interested in getting other people to see for themselves.' \nCope stops for breath and, as if reviewing his role in life, remarks: 'In the end, I'm not a very good rock 'n' roller, but I'm a very good Julian Cope.'",

        "blog_text": "I saw that I was lying on a bed. I was neither comfortable nor uncomfortable: I was lying on my back. But I began to consider how, and on what, I was lying - a question which had not till then occurred to me. And observing my bed, I saw I was lying on plaited string supports attached to its sides: my feet were resting on one such support, by calves on another, and my legs felt uncomfortable. I seemed to know that those supports were movable, and with a movement of my foot I pushed away the furthest of them at my feet - it seemed to me that it would be more comfortable so. But I pushed it away too far and wished to reach it again with my foot, and that movement caused the next support under my calves to slip away also, so that my legs hung in the air. I made a movement with my whole body to adjust myself, fully convinced that I could do so at once; but the movement caused the other supports under me to slip and to become entangled, and I saw that matters were going quite wrong: the whole of the lower part of my body slipped and hung down, though my feet did not reach the ground. I was holding on only by the upper part of my back, and not only did it become uncomfortable but I was even frightened. And then only did I ask myself about something that had not before occurred to me. I asked myself: Where am I and what am I lying on? and I began to look around and first of all to look down in the direction which my body was hanging and whiter I felt I must soon fall. I looked down and did not believe my eyes. I was not only at a height comparable to the height of the highest towers or mountains, but at a height such as I could never have imagined.  I could not even make out whether I saw anything there below, in that bottomless abyss over which I was hanging and whiter I was being drawn. My heart contracted, and I experienced horror. To look thither was terrible. If I looked thither I felt that I should at once slip from the last support and perish. And I did not look. But not to look was still worse, for I thought of what would happen to me directly I fell from the last support. And I felt that from fear I was losing my last supports, and that my back was slowly slipping lower and lower. Another moment and I should drop off. And then it occurred to me that this cannot be real. It is a dream. Wake up! I try to arouse myself but cannot do so. What am I to do? What am I to do? I ask myself, and look upwards. Above, there is also an infinite space. I look into the immensity of sky and try to forget about the immensity below, and I really do forget it. The immensity below repels and frightens me; the immensity above attracts and strengthens me. I am still supported above the abyss by the last supports that have not yet slipped from under me; I know that I am hanging, but I look only upwards and my fear passes. As happens in dreams, a voice says: 'Notice this, this is it!' And I look more and more into the infinite above me and feel that I am becoming calm. I remember all that has happened, and remember how it all happened; how I moved my legs, how I hung down, how frightened I was, and how I was saved from fear by looking upwards. And I ask myself: Well, and now am I not hanging just the same? And I do not so much look round as experience with my whole body the point of support on which I am held. I see that I no longer hang as if about to fall, but am firmly held. I ask myself how I am held: I feel about, look round, and see that under me, under the middle of my body, there is one support, and that when I look upwards I lie on it in the position of securest balance, and that it alone gave me support before. And then, as happens in dreams, I imagined the mechanism by means of which I was held; a very natural intelligible, and sure means, though to one awake that mechanism has no sense. I was even surprised in my dream that I had not understood it sooner. It appeared that at my head there was a pillar, and the security of that slender pillar was undoubted though there was nothing to support it. From the pillar a loop hung very ingeniously and yet simply, and if one lay with the middle of one's body in that loop and looked up, there could be no question of falling. This was all clear to me, and I was glad and tranquil. And it seemed as if someone said to me: 'See that you remember.'",

According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, a healthy individual should have a Body Mass Index (or BMI) of between 18.5 and 25. This would put my desired weight at somewhere in the vicinity of 150 pounds.  My BMI is 38.1  According to the Centers for Disease Control, over 44 Million Americans qualified as obese in 2001.  44 Million . This isn't counting the millions of Americans who qualify as 'overweight.'  Looks like I'm not alone.  I've been fat for as long as I can remember. Sure, there are photos of me as a strapping young boy running around the neighborhood looking as thin and healthy as the next kid, but I can't remember being that age and as such, I regard those photos with guarded skepticism. At my heaviest I was 285 - senior year of high school, the perfect time to be obese and unattractive. Inspiration struck me, and for the first time I managed to stick to a diet and excercise regiment that worked. By the fall of my freshman year of college I was down to 225, and the world was my oyster. Sadly, I ate a little too much tartar sauce with that oyster, and in the years since graduation I've managed to slowly start putting the weight back on.  The past two years have been a yo-yo only Oprah could love. Five pounds off, ten pounds on, motivation one week, mozzarella the next. Such is the life of a career fat man.  So what is the purpose of this Blog? I'd like to say something flowery and inspirational, but I've been around long enough to know that there's a slim chance (har har) of me actually sticking to any sort of diet long enough to lose a significant amount of weight. But I'll keep track of my progress here, and along with that I'll do my best to give you, the reader, an insight into the life of a morbidly obese twentysomething.

It's not easy being fat in America. Not to say that it isn't hard to be a woman, or an immigrant, or black, or hispanic, or asian, or handicapped, or anything else. But I will say this:  No matter who you are, no matter what race, sex, creed or nationality, it's socially acceptable to point at a fat person and laugh.   And no one would call you insensitive.

        "blog_text": "I read a lot of people's live journals, xangas, and blogs and it seems that the popular thing to do these days is write an entry of reflection on the school year that's just passed.  It's a daunting task because I've changed so much over these past ten months.  After leaving Fieldston I was a complete wreck, worse than I was while  at  the damn school.  During the summer I was better able to come out of the depression and look for new things in my life to fill in for things I didn't want or had lost.  But, essentially, I was still holding on to people, and attitudes that were keeping me from growing.  It's a hard thing to explain.  Imagine a person who's completely unfit to function socially and internally.  Then imagine that person being stripped of the thing that was causing them that discomfort.  Then imagine that discomfort fading away slowly, leaving residue along the way as the person continues to change.  That was me during the summer.  I was very much enlightened and enriched by my experience working at the day care center.  I think that was instrumental in helping me to mature.  I look at myself in several stages; there's a few Fieldston stages, the first of which I liked but as my personality deteriorates in those stages, I like who I was less and less.  Then there's the stage where I've transferred to A. Philip Randolph.  That stage is riddled with relief, depression, and feelings of failure and detachment.  Then there's the summer, where I'm relieved that I don't go to a school that is nothing more than a reminder of how bad I fucked up at Fieldston and I feel like I can just forget it all.  I liked myself during the summer--I think I was in an ok place.  I dislike myself at Fieldston.  And I pity myself at Randolph last year.  This past fall, I was starting to grow more.  I was nearing the point of having been in therapy with Michael for a year and I was starting to be able to see the differences and the growth.  But I made some bad mistakes in the Fall, and I don't like those actions.  I also burned several bridges that Fall--without building new ones.  And that made me lonely in the winter.  But every Friday, I would find myself at Michael's office feeling more confident, feeling like I was on the right track, feeling like my lonesome feelings would pass.  In the Spring, I built new bridges and my loneliness passed.  I've brought these feelings of maturity, direction, and confidence in my moral fiber and my decision-making into the summer.  I feel great these days and I look back sometimes to months ago and I see a completely different person.  I don't dwell on the past anymore--I'm too busy looking to the future.  I learned that to be comfortable, you don't always have to have someone to talk to, sometimes you have to have time that you dedicate to yourself and personal growth.  I also learned that life is not only about building bridges, but also about burning them.    Thank-you's? Daniel--you're constant solidarity has always been a guidance to me.  We're a team at everything and I wouldn't have it any other way.  You may not realize it but I aspire to many of your qualities.    Michael--you're not going to read this, but I'll go on anyway.  I used to wonder why you never talk very much during our meetings and why I always have to lead the conversation.  Now I know that what you've taught me is much more valuable than the things you could have been saying.  You taught me and you're still teaching me how to make the right decisions and figure out my feelings for myself--rather than acting out in opposition to them.  Everyone from school--all the people from school have been so great this year.  I would have never known that I was going to love my school this much if anyone had asked me last year.  And I love my school because of the warm, outgoing people that attend it.  My parents--for knowing that no matter how bad things got, I could always figure out how to pull through on my own and never judging me when I was down and out.  This whole thing is probably very confusing and hard to follow, but long story short, I'm happier than I've ever been before, I've changed  a lot , and all those good things are all thanks to a number of influential people in my life, and some long, hard, self-reflection.",

Without the effects I would be forced to recall who I was, and that wouldn't be good for me in my recent state, at least for the past few days. 'Today day is a good day to have fun', I thought. The sky was a new thing to me, half was vibrant from the day, but it progressed into blackness in the distance.

I follow the god-awful sounds until I see a small clearing, which opens to a larger clearing where there is a small shanty-looking house. 'They will not suffer', a voice from the inside of my head says. 'Who the hell was that?', I say aloud...disturbing the small ones. They look at me with wide eyes, unburdened with fear that should be there. I take the tip of the sickle, 'M' we will call her, and make a line from the bend in my elbow to the middle of the back of my hand. The little children are disturbed by this and run, screaming. The opening of my flesh brings to me an unexplainable euphoria. The 'concoction' has a new, stronger effect due to the adrenaline that I provide to my blood. I make thin, spidery lines from my mid-calf to my groin area, as if they are pointing at something that isn't interesting to anyone. Why is it there? The adrenaline-'concoction' mixture is losing strength, due to the blood loss. 'I made a mess', I say aloud to noone in particular.

        "blog_text": "I grew up with both sets of parents under the same roof but it was Lola (grandmother) who raised me up. It was she who exposed me to all the good smells and flavors of the kitchen. The results?  1. I have a sharp tongue, mataray, and a helplessly critical about, um, food! I find unpalatable food served before me in restaurants an insult to my taste and often, couldn't help but voice it out.  2. I still feel guilty when the pots and pans aren't sleek, shiny, and scrubbed to its last millimeter of steel or copper, as if Lola was behind me with her  binugha  (firewood). Even with her petite frame, she was tyranny personified. In fact, she was a Marcos loyalist. 'Nuff said.  Perhaps, she was also a witch. I like thinking about her this way because it lends so much color to the 16 years I spent with her. Lola's legacy (my inheritance from her) was more valuable than the ring, which I lost 5 months after she died. Part of this are the small nuggets of wisdom, charms and spells, that I'm sure, I'll pass on to my children.  1.  Spider webs as wound treatment.    Once upon a time when I was five and bored, I decided to see what would happen if I stuck my finger between the electric fan blades. The thing was turned on, of course, and consequently, the Sunday morning hum-drum was chased away by gushing blood and wails of terror. Care to guess the treatment? a. Clean wound with soap and water. b. Scour ceilings and corners for spider webs. Wrap web around finger (over any wound, as the case may be).  It healed quite quickly after that.  2.  Matters related to teeth.    Straight teeth.  Several months ago, my dentist asked me if I had worn braces before. To his amazement, I proceeded to tell him what my grandmother did. When I was very young, she massaged my gums and teeth regularly with her fingers. Perhaps not very witch-like but they did make braces or retainers unnecessary.  Strong choppers. Insert the first tooth extracted from a kid into a crack in the house's main pillar. This will ensure teeth as strong as the pillar itself. Sometimes, I doubt the efficacy of this one ---my dentist told me I still have 6 more cavities to be filled.  Then I'd remember that, a. I have not been very diligent in my teeth duties; b. I've never had any cause to be afraid of the dentist (a root canal, for instance.) Needless to say, I concede that perhaps, the ritual helped.   3.  Menstruation  This rite of passage actually involves a long list of rituals! Like several of my cousins from my Father's side, I had my period early at age 9. To prevent endless teasing on  pagdadalaga  ahead of time, this was kept a secret. On that first day, nevertheless, the cousins and neighbors playing outside our house were perhaps to engrossed to notice that:  a. I had been running around the house's perimeter and up the stairs 3 times. This was supposed to counter the lethargy of 'Meron ako' days. The '3' times probably refers to the usual 3 days of heavy flow.  b. I jumped the 3 steps. Same reason as above.  c. The following were rubbed on my face:    - a ball of cotton    - the petals of a red gumamela    -  the  undies with the first specter of blood    Reason: These are supposed to ensure a blemish-free, rosy-cheek complexion.   d. I was told to eat nothing sour or acidic for the duration of the period. It would chase the period away and give me an ache in the  puson  (abdomen).  e. I was lectured to stay out of the rain when until the period's over. Could it be because of the 'acid' rain? He he.   4. More on good skin. (Have I mentioned that my grandmother was rather vain and proud of her white  kili-kili  or armpits?)  To prevent deep noticeable scarring (keloids or those of lesser degree), the baby must, during his/her first bath, be rubbed all over with a glass bottle to the following incantation:   Manundog ka sa botilya, hamis, way bu-ak    Be like the glass bottle, without scars, without cracks, smooth...) This is recited over and over again.  Efficacy:  Proven . I recommend this especially if you think your kid will be accident-prone like me, or if you were sure you'd be passing on 'pimple-generating' genes to your kid.   5. Payment for life extensions.  Perhaps it is a pagan Visayan custom because a lot of people could relate to this one. Not a birthday would pass by without Lola killing a live chicken right in our kitchen. She would then take a bit of the chicken blood and rub it on my forehead, forming the cross sign as she did so. The chicken was supposed to have been sacrificed for that particular new year in my life. Talk about inculturation!  Of course, everyone would notice the bloody cross on my forehead and greet me happy birthday without any questions.  6. Active minds and charmingly talkative, agressive kindergarteners  My cousins and I did not experience any separation anxiety on our first day of school. Same thing went for the other neighborhood kids who were also in my age group.  On the first day of kindergarten, Lola roasted corn kernels in a stovetop pan. On our way down the stairs out of the house, she showered us (cousins and neighbors included) with the corn kernels, saying over and over,   Manundog kamo sa mais. Magpiti-piti inyong bâbâ!   (Something like: Let your mouths be like the crunchy corn kernels. Noisy.)  In other words, it was a prayer and a send-off to be agressive, active participants in class. It may have worked. I think two of my cousins were often cited for being too talkative. Nobody bullied any of us, either.   7. Kontra Biyahilo (Anti-motion sickness) I was travelling to Tacloban with my coach to attend a Regional Quiz Bee. Thinking that the zigzagging mountain roads might enduce me to get sick on the way, she made me place a matchstick near my belly. Perhaps, it was inside a small plastic bag (used for ice candy) and pinned to the waistline of my school uniform.   I could not remember the reason for this. I could not even vouch for its efficacy, either, since I have never really been prone to motion sickness. The 'game' but perpetually woozy ones among you can try it, though.   These are just a few of local customs and rituals handed down to me from my beloved lola peling. For sure, there'll be a Lola Series #2.",

        "blog_text": "Hello. My name is Richie Meyer. I am a 'dweeb'. I am a 'nerd'. I am a 'pansy'. I am a 'wimp, loser, dork, idiot, hoser, lame-o, waste-of-space', and I am also a 'four-eyed, fat-assed, carrot-topped, goody-two-shoed, mama's boy'. Apparently, “I will never kiss a girl, because I suck.'. Also, I 'will never get picked to play basketball, football, baseball, or soccer, because I suck'. Additionally, I better keep my mouth shut, or I will find myself 'stuffed in a locker like beef in a burrito...and I suck.'. To say the least, I am finding the social aspects of the 8th grade rather...challenging. And it's all because of Steve Zepner, or 'Big Z' as he calls himself. Just last week, 'Big Z' pulled my pants down in the cafeteria. Steve shouted, 'Looks like a toddler'. Everyone had a good laugh. That was really fun. At times, I wonder how it would feel to punch him repeatedly in the face, for ohh, let's say, 7 to 10 hours. My hand would get sore, but then I could switch to a nine-iron or a billy-club. Here's another good one: Three months ago, we were in Ms. Bonaquisti's math class, and Big Z didn't do too hot on his test, I whispered, 'looks more like 'Big F'.' Luckily, Steve heard that. So after school, he relieved himself on some snow and happily made me eat it. What an experience. But yesterday, Big Z really out-did himself. You see, there is this Girl Suzie Derkins, and like me, she isn't the most popular kid, victimized by ridicule and truly underappreciated for her smarts and charm. I like her. I like her a lot. So I am talking to her in the hallway, getting up the nerve to ask her to the spring dance, and I feel an arm come around my shoulder. 'Well I owe you ten bucks man, you were right, she is the ugliest girl in school!' Said Big Z. Suzie Derkins started crying and ran away. Then Big Z took my pants down again. What a kidder. Good Times. I went home yesterday, I called Suzie Derkins and apologized, and swore I'd make it up to her. Big Z was going down. April the 10th, 2004 7:50am-- First Period. I give my daily announcement over the school loudspeakers....'The girls volleyball team has made the sectional tournament, so let's give them our support, the Science Club will meet in Mr. Lanin's room, and Steve Zepner, a.k.a Big Z, is inviting all you guys over after school for cookies that he baked with his mommy last night.' 9:20am- First passing time. Steve is hunting me in the hallways. He doesn't find me, because I am breaking into his locker, and spraying down his gym clothes with cat piss. 9:35am-- Second Period. Steve is summoned to the office for an urgent phone call: 'Hello?', 'Hi Steve, it's Richie Meyer, just wanted to let you know that your mom is banging the principal, and your dad wants a sex change. Oh! by the way, when you are working at the corner gas station in twenty years, I am going to buy it just so I can fire your dumb ass. Ta ta.' 9:27am-- Back to class. Steve returns to class to find his bag missing, and replaced by a pink 'Hello Kitty' bag, filled with Britney Spears notebooks, rainbow stickers, unicorn folders, etc. 9:28am-- Steve is mad. 10:55am-- Second Passing Time. Steve organizes his underlings for a group hunt. They see me in the nurse's office complaining of a stomach problem. I moon them when Nurse McClintock turns away. 11:10am-- Third Period. I eat five raw eggs, three pickles and drink a 1/2 gallon of milk & beet juice in the bathroom. I get to class late, with a note from the nurse, I walk by Steve in the aisle, he is threatening me. I throw up on him. I am sent home for the day. Steve is sent to his gym locker for a change of clothes. Good times. 3:50pm-- Steve rings my doorbell, his lackies in tow. Suzie Derkins answers, and kicks him in the balls. May 5, 2004 10:00pm-- I kiss Suzie goodnight after the dance. 11:00pm-- Big Z gets arrested for drinking and driving. October 11, 2024 9:07am-- I purchase the 'Kwik Stop Gas & Chow' on Pleasant Street. Good Times.",

        "blog_text": "May 19, 2004 - Discharged From Broward General Medical Ctr \nI am starting this journal so that one day I might be able to make sense, so that some day I can maybe make peace with this disease, so that some day others might find courage in knowing that someone else has walked in their footsteps, and as a sources and means for my own sanity.  I was diagnosed HIV +, I had been tested a few different times in the past and always it provided me the comfort of being negative but not this last time. It all started with me getting an infection around the outside of my eyelids, I was given a good dosage of antibiotics. Shortly after this, my ears became infected and a rash developed around my mouth, then a rash under my armpit. I went to the hospital and the symptoms would almost disappear but then they would re-occur it started in Aug 2003, and it wasn't until May 2004 that I was actually diagnosed. I was admitted namely because my platelet level was dangerously low, according to the medical staff was partly the cause of the infections not healing. It totally made sense, of course now to find out why the platelet levels were so low. Of course they wanted to rule out everything from lupus to leukemia, some of those test I'm still awaiting the results of, in the interim I was asked when my last HIV test was taken, or if I had ever been test, I did confirm that I had been tested a number of years ago, and that I didn't feel at risk as those tests were negative and taken after I had been with my last partner, and I hadn't been with anyone since.  But to my surprise my test revealed that I was infected with the HIV antibodies. Now I'm awaiting more information, awaiting social services and government assistance and wondering why. I am not really sure exactly what will become of this, there is a number of directions it could go. At the very least if I can gain something it's wonderful, and then it even becomes greater if someone else besides me benefits.   I guess it's all a matter of how you look at it that counts, is the glass half empty or half full? - Some view being positive as a death sentence and others are able to embrace it and accept it. I was told now-a-days HIV was like diabetes that patients are living years and years with the disease, so exactly how do you embrace and accept death when faced with it? Unless you make peace with the disease and accept, and embrace it the disease is simply going to eat away at you quicker, because of this it's essential that you not run away and face the light that shines ahead, for me the way I try to look at it. I should quickly learn and evaluate what is important in my life, what I appreciate in life, and even more on the other hand, what is it that I need to do in my life.    \nJune 02, 2004 - My First Clinical         \nMy Day began with my landlord (Duane) knocking on my door to discuss an issue about another tenant that lives on the property where I currently reside, I took the opportunity to inform my landlord that tomorrow June 3, 2004 when my rent was due that I wasn't going to be able to pay him my rent and explained to him that I had been diagnosed being HIV positive, he explained to me that his partner (Charlie) has been positive for 20 plus years and told me that although this disease could be terminal how it will change my life, how it will make my life different, and how many avenues would be open to me now.  When being newly diagnosed with HIV it kind of opens the doors for all kinds of benefits and assistance with your living and well-being but the system is set up as such that Nobody will talk to you until you have a Case Manager. So on June 02, 2004 I had my first appointment with Comprehensive Care Center off of Broward Blvd and 11th Avenue in Ft Lauderdale, Florida it was quite the ordeal. First my morning had started with the Medicaid social worker calling advising me that I need to come into the hospital so that I can submit an application for Medicaid & Food Stamps. I inquired with her about seeing a Case Manager and when I would see the Case Manager, she stated that she really wasn't sure. I had a gut instinct and feeling that I would meet and see the Case Manager at the clinic. The thing about applying for any assistance you must be linked to the resource, program by a Case Manager. I asked the Medicaid worker if I'd be meeting my Case Manager she stated, no, so I called the clinic I was told that my first visit with them as an Intake, and would be to see a Financial Counselor and then immediately following that I'd see the Case Manager. I was approximately about 10 minutes early for my 2pm appointment with the clinic. I signed paperwork and continued to wait. Finally after waiting for almost 2 hours and knowing the clinic closed at 4:30 I asked the receptionist if they were ever going to call me. She said, they haven't called you yet... I was sitting in front of her the entire time, and she went into the back. Immediately following that the financial counselor called me I wasn't impressed with the idiot at all. She continued to call me by an incorrect last name continually over and over again, she was loud, and obnoxious and just slightly rude. At the end of her paperwork she said let me see if I can't get the Case Manager to talk to you, when she did get a hold of the case manager, she stated that the case manager was leaving and 5 minutes and that I'd have to come back. I was enraged by this action, especially being as my need is somewhat urgent. Finally another Case Manager had agreed to see me.      Helen Stolin who is remarkable, and wonderful stated to me that she would from this point on be my Case Manager from this point and had explained that she no longer does intake but she is the Case Manager that usually get transferred the emergency cases or people who really are in need. She gave me a couple of different places I could go and receive immediate food.  Poverello , as well as a Church, she gave me information about  Housing Opportunities for Persons With Aids (HOPWA) ., She also informed me to go to Mount Olive Development Corp and stated they would provide assistance to persons who needed help with rental payments who were HIV+, she stated that there was a 6 month waiting period but to go ahead and apply because many times she has seen cases where people think they won't be in a position and 6 months later they are still in the same situation.   At the end of the day I called my landlord and spoke with Charlie explaining that I needed to discuss some things with Duane upon returning my call we got together and I explained the information that I had found out about  HOPWA . Duane said that he wanted to read the documents over and that he would decide whether or not he wanted me to pursue this avenue of assistance that was available to me.    \nJune 3, 2004 - Assistance Starts To Begin.          \nMy morning again began early about 9am which for the average bird isn't early but considering the fact that I've not been able to sleep well at night, considering the fact that over the last 24 hours I had only had about 2.5 hours worth of sleep, and I didn't fall asleep until about 5am, it is amazing that I was up and awake at 8:30 in the morning. I was however, aware that today was a very important day for me, Patti arrived at my house at approximately 10:15am. I gathered all the information I needed for the Medicaid & Food Stamp applications and then called Brad at  Poverello , I informed him that Helen had referred me to the food club and she was asking if they could set up with an emergency basket of food. He told me show up any day this week between 10am and 1pm and he would set me up with an emergency basket of food.   I was at the hospital's corporate office at approximately about 10:45am to meet Ms Roberta Dalhouse so that I could apply for the Medicaid & Food Stamps however she was unable to assist me stating it was a busy morning however she immediately got another worker within her office to take my information and fill out the forms and applications needed for both the Medicaid & Food Stamps. The process was rather quick considering the amount of paperwork that was needed and considering the fact that Ms Dalhouse had the case load that she had that morning. I was out of there by 11:30am, I called Patti to let her know I was done and needed to be picked up, standing outside of the hospital I ran in Tari Johnson from Humana Biscayne a former co-worker and she told me that her mom Betty Johnson was working in the admissions office there at Broward General. Patti picked me up about 12:10pm and we were off and on our way to  Poverello . I saw Brad he explained that he was going to set me up with an emergency box of food, and explained the way the food club worked. I have another appointment with Alex for the intake at the food club on June 9th at 2pm then I will be able to go to  Poverello  once a week to pick up a basket of food. Jason tells me that you can choose to pick up food weekly or monthly. But I wasn't given that option. Maybe Alex will give me that option when I talk to him. I'm not sure. I was really surprised at the amount of food they give you. They gave me 3 pieces of chicken, 2 hamburgers, 2 pork chops, carrots, potatoes, onions, 3 cans of soup, a can of tuna fish, toilet paper, bread, grits, eggs, milk, isotonic drinks (cranberry, lemon-aide, fruit blast) dried black beans, rice, macaroni and cheese, blueberry muffins, cinnamon snack cakes, 2 oranges, 2 bananas, 2 apples, and there are probably a few items that I'm missing or forgetting to mention, but whatever the case is they made sure that I will be fed this week. Patti, Jason & I hung out over at Patti's house, and when Cathy got home we ordered Pizza from Dominos. Patti & Cathy took us both to the Indian Reservation to pick up cartons of cigarettes. I arrived home at 10:10pm and called my Duane to make arrangements to pay him some of the rent what Jason & I both could afford to throw him. Jason paid $500.00 dollars, and I gave $80.00 towards my rent, total $580.00 and to my surprise Duane had filled out the forms for  HOPWA , which I will be submitting tomorrow.    \nJune 4, 2004 - Nothing to Worry About???       \nI woke up later than I had originally planned to this morning not getting out of bed until about 10:30am. I called the information I had found online for the local  HOPWA  administrator, and was informed that Duane was correct in stating that I did not need the 3 day notice, however Duane had omitted his signature on the W9 form that is required. I attempted to call Helen to inform her of what Michael had told me about not needing the 3 day notice, and to find out if I could possibly just fax over the information to her, and however she didn't return my call.  Then about 12:45pm Rose-Marie called from the clinic, she stated that my lab work had come back and she was concerned and wanted to know if I had ever had any bleeding problems? I informed her that platelet level at the hospital was dangerously low and she asked what my platelet level was at while I was in the hospital, which was 28,000, when I asked her what my level was at she responded it's gone down to 14,000. Which according to the doctors I had at the hospital is a sign that either someone is possibly bleeding internally or at the risk of having a brain aneurysm. Now I'm extremely curious as to what the results of my Bone Marrow Biopsy will be when I get it on Tuesday June 8th from The Cancer Center at the hospital. I will tell you know that I'm not going to be doing too well if on top of the HIV it is determined that I have leukemia. So now I have the weekend to be worried, and concerned. I asked Rose-Marie if I was going to be okay and she said, you'll be okay if you cut yourself and/or start bleeding go to the hospital, and she was going to see if there was anyway I could get in to see the Dr Sharma prior to June 10. I communicated with Duane what information I had found out about  HOPWA  today, and informed him that I would be submitting the paperwork to them as of Monday    \nJune 6, 2004 - A New Week       \nThis is the beginning of the a new week, and there is a lot to look forward too, first up on Monday I need to get in touch with Helen Stolin and submit the paperwork for  HOPWA , so that they might be able to provide me with some assistance as far as my rent goes. Also up on Monday I want to go ahead and being as I'm going to be going into the clinic I want to contact Rose-Marie and see if I should plan on trying to come in to see the doctor because of my platelet levels. I spent a good portion of Friday night out with some friends, and then came home from I-hop and started doing some research. One of the links I've included on my website, are links to  Project Inform , I found this site to be very informative with information about the types of lab work that is done with HIV cases, what to come to expect, and how to read and interpret T-cell count and Viral load counts I'm still interested in finding out what these figures are at, currently. I've told some friends of mine that it is a big desire for me to get everything for my care coordinated so that I can focus my time volunteering and helping others out who are newly diagnosed. Being positive I want to make sure that I treat this thing positively and the only way to do that is to live with it each and every day If I can influence someone who is infected to be tested so their disease is caught in early stages, or if I can be the one who inspires someone to stop and think before putting themselves at risk then there will be purpose and value added to my existence on this earthly level. I must by morning formulate a work plan to show  HOPWA  that I am working towards being self-sufficient.  So I must work on that a little before bed, it's already 2:46am. I have tentative appoints on Tuesday with the Oncologist who did the bone marrow biopsy, Wednesday with intake office at  Poverello  food club and Thursday with Dr Sharma and Helen Stolin.  Also I hope to hear from Department of Children and Family Services (DCF) in reference to my Food Stamp Application, and my Medicaid Application. Hopefully these are benefits which will be prompt with their findings so that I can coordinate the type of care I wish to receive outside of the hospital district, and can take advantage of other services such as Life-Line which will lower my Telephone Plan or Assistance with my electricity bill,and things of that nature. Of course I'll keep you posted on my day-to-day ups and downs. Also I will more than likely be following up with the Social Security Office to find out if there has been any determination made about possibly finding my claim to be Presumably Disabled. This is another thing I need to be discussing with Dr Sharma or whoever I choose to be my primary doctor. I'm really unclear as to whether or not I'm going to stick with the doctors at the hospital clinic although I would love to be treated by Dr Faureau, which is the MD I had while I was hospitalized I seriously doubt that she is in practice for herself. I did however notice that she was at the clinic during my last appointment, so if I get the chance or opportunity to follow up with her at some point I would be very open to that idea    \nJune 7, 2004 - Paperwork Submitted        \nThis morning started early as a matter of fact last night I had yet another sleepless night after going over everything again and again I drafted a letter to be included with my application to  HOPWA , this morning first thing at 8am I was on the phone attempting to call the nurse about my platelet counts and calling Helen about the paperwork she needed. Finally after reaching Rose Marie I was able to get a hold of Helen about 9:15am she advised me to come in at 2:30pm, after getting a hold of Helen I then touched base with Rose Marie and let her know that I was going to be coming into the clinic at 2:30 she informed me that she had spoken with Dr Sharma and the doctor had stated that I could wait until my scheduled appointment on Thursday. So in the morning I have the appointment with The Cancer Center at the hospital because of my platelet levels I've been a little bit concerned about that, but my hopes remain high that the bone marrow is going to come back with good results. At the very least those are my hopes, I'll obviously know more and write more tomorrow. After going and meeting with Helen I came home and went to sleep, and slept for the majority of the evening. Now it's approximately 2am and I'll be attempting to sleep tonight. So that I can have a productive day tomorrow. Helen said that she'd be submitted the application today and that she would touch base with me tomorrow. Her hopes honestly didn't seem all that promising however it's worth a shot I have nothing to loose and everything to gain. I am hoping that I can receive some assistance if not I will be going insane on this end. For now I am going to try and get some rest and I'll be writing more tomorrow after Dr Taub's appointment at the Cancer Center over at Broward General Medical Center.     \nJune 8, 2004 - Bone Marrow Biopsy       \nI got the results of my Bone Marrow Biopsy and everything appears to be normal though they are still curious why my platelet levels are down as of the CBC done this morning my count was at approximately 6000 so we are even lower than on June 2, 2004. The term used to describe a low platelet count is Thrombocytopenia. They wanted me to come in to have IGIV and originally I was going to make that appointment for Friday until I realized that I was taking Patti & Cathy to the airport on Friday. So I made the appointment for the treatment for Wednesday of next week. I was told to expect the IV treatment to take about 6 to 7 hours, and to eat something prior to coming in and also bring in food as food wasn't supplied there. Today has just been a slightly okay day I checked in with Helen from Comprehensive but wasn't able to reach her, I left a message for her to return my call. We shall see if she does or not. I'm still in moderate pain but I am under the assumption that is going to be the case for awhile.    \nJune 9, 2004 - Intake At Poverello Food Club    \nWell I met Cathy for lunch, we went to Skyline Chili off of Federal Highway just right outside Wilton Manors, I had a Jumbo 5 way which was really out of this world. I really enjoyed it afterwards I dropped Cathy back off at work, and continued on my way to  Poverello  for my intake appointment with Alex. I was a little worried about possibly being a few minutes late but as it turned out it really didn't matter much as when I arrived Alex had someone in his office already and I ended up having to wait until approximately 2:30pm until he was done, when Alex walked out of his office. I immediately recognized his face, at first I couldn't place where I had known him from but I knew that I had dealt with him, someplace in my past. Shortly into the intake interview with Alex it came to me where I had known him from, and I asked him, 'You don't remember me, do you?' his reply was 'yes, but I don't remember from where'. Then I said, I trained you and you worked for me at Direct Mail Center and he was totally shocked we talked a bit about the past, and he revealed that he had been positive for 17 years, again a reassurance that HIV is no longer a death sentence. He explained the food club in better detail than Brad had done, he also told me that they have a gym located across the street that I could use for free, and they have a fitness instructor in the gym and the nutritionist Lee would be glad to set me up with that information. In addition Alex informed me that everyone gets a 10 dollar voucher for the thrift store next door for clothing items only. He gave me my voucher and told me that if i ever needed anything additional they will try to provide me with whatever I need to just let them know, and they can't guarentee it, but they will attempt to get me what I need. With that I picked up my food basket and was going to go next door and look through the thrift shop however I was exhausted and wanted to go ahead and get home so I figured I'd wait and visit the thrift store the following week.    \nJune 10, 2004 - Finally Meeting Dr Sharma.    \nFinally my first appointment with the Doctor, I felt a relatively good vibe from Dr Sharma however the news he gave me wasn't the greatest news in the world. My CD4 or T Cell count was 111, and my viral load is over 750,000, these are not good numbers at all. According to the  Centers for Disease Control  therapy for HIV should begin anytime the CD4 count is under 350 or the viral load is over 100,000 as with those counts you are in jeopardy of developing OI's (Opportunistic Infections). Some examples of OI's include Bactrial Pnuemonia, Toxoplasmosis, Herpes just to name a few diseases that I've learned that I'm in jeopardy of developing now. In addition to finding out this information there are several refferals they are setting up through the center, they want me to see a cardiologist, an optamologist, a dermatologist, a pharmacologist, I informed Dr Sharma about the findings at the Cancer Center and fact that I had been scheduled for the IGIV on June 16. Dr Sharma asked if I was going to be getting the IGIV once a month? I told him that as far as I knew they only wanted me to in for the one treatment. He gave me Kaletra, Viread, Epivir, and Bactrim, those are the medications specifically for the HIV, he advised me to get them filled but not to start taking them until I met with the pharmacologist. In addition, he gave me percoset, flagyl, cipro, lexapro, trazadone, and prenatal vitamins.   \nI immediately went to the health department to get the prescriptions filled, again more red tape. I needed to take all the documents I had previously given to them 100 times over just to be approved to get my medications, I arrived at the health department at 3:15pm and they informed me that I wouldn't be able to get them as I need to be there prior to 3:30pm. It was only 3:15pm the pharmacy tech says 'well it takes about 45 mins to process the paperwork. Of course I raised hell and she gave me the information to take over to the intake office to be certified, I immediately ran over and it only took about 10 mins for them to process the paperwork and then again I was off to the pharmacy area at the health department 30 mins later I had all the medications with the exceptions of the Percoset, they wouldn't dispense that but I was informed to go over to Broward General and they would fill that prescription for me, in addition they wouldn't dispense lexapro they called Dr Sharma to find out if he would like to prescribe me something different then lexapro, he stated that he wanted to wait until I saw the Psychiatrist. I was alarmed as I only had 5 lexapro left, and I wasn't due to the psychiatrist until June 29. From the health department I headed over to the Broward General and they filled the percoset script for me within a matter of about 10 mins.    \nJune 11, 2004 - A Day Off At The Airport    \nWell finally a day off without an appointment, it is nice to be able to relax for a day. I had to take Patti & Cathy to the airport at 12:30 this afternoon, they are flying out to California to see Patti's mother and her brother, and Cathy has made arrangements to visit her Niece and Nephew, Cory and Sarah, and to see Sam (her other brother) and her other Nephew Jared. They have a really long flight because even though I took them to the airport at 12:30 they aren't getting into California until about 10:30pm pst. In the meantime I have the use of Cathy's car and in return I am going to be making sure their cat (Furby), and dog (cokie) are taken care of. I will very possibly just end up spending the time over at their place, however I may travel back and forth I haven't yet decided. I could also pack up the animals and take them back to my place, but it's easier to keep the animals in their own house as opposed to packing them up and taking them back to my place. I will be picking them up from the airport on June 17, and then on the June 18 or June 19 they will be taking off to go visit Patti's Daughter in Arkansas. The bad thing about that is that right now Patti's car is broken down and they will be driving to Arkansas which means that unless they rent a car (which they aren't planning on doing to my knowledge) I will be without transportation while they are gone to Arkansas.    \nJune 14, 2004 - A Day with the Psycologist    \nThis morning at 10:00am I had my first appointment with the Psycologist whose name is Betz Davies, the appointment seemed to go rather quickly she asked me so many questions and things seemed to go rather quickly she explained to me that she was a part of Broward House and comes to Comprehensive only on Monday mornings to provide counseling to the patients at Comprehensive she suggested that I take part in some of the support groups there at the center which are held every other Wednesday and incidentally the support groups are run by Helen, yes the same Helen that is my case manager. I find that very wonderful and another great thing about the Support Group is that they meet at 12:30 in the afternoon and they provide lunch. I do intend on attending the next support group which will be on Wednesday June 23, 2004. Betz also gave me a copy of Poz Thinking a wonderful magazine which is all about newly diagnosed people and how they handled being diagnosed there was actually some very interesting articles and I have enjoyed reading the magazine. I mentioned my concerns about the situation with the lexapro and not being able to get that prescription filled. Betz thought it would be best if we meet once a week for the next several weeks and stated that I could talk about anything I wanted to talk about, also when she sent me to the scheduler she asked if there was anyway they could get me into see Dr Abi before June 29, and to my surprise they scheduled me to see Dr Abi, the very next morning. So now I have an appointment with the psychiatrist tomorrow morning at 8 am. I also figured since I had that appointment and that since I was scheduled to pick up my weekly basket at  Poverello  on Wednesday and that I was basically told to expect a full day at the hospital that I would try to pick up my food basket from poverello on Tuesday after my appointment with Dr Abi. The scheduler also informed me that the appointment with Dr Abi was basically an open slot where they schedule 3 or 4 patients at the same time and it's on a first come, first serve basis so if i got there early chances are I would be the first one called.     \nJune 15, 2004 - Psychiatrist Dr Abi reporting    \nI woke up this morning at 7:00 am just in time to make it early for my appointment I figured let me just get another 5 minutes worth of sleep. I closed my eyes when i re-opened them to my surprise it was 8:30am and I was late for my appointment I rushed and scrambled and still half asleep jumped into the car and headed out for Comprehensive as quickly as possible. I signed in and explained that my alarm had been reset at some point during the night and that was the reason why I was late. Maria at the front desk said that it wasn't a problem and soon enough I was being called by Dr Abi. He is a middle aged balding man who talked with a really funny accent, he basically asked me some of the same questions that Betz had asked me just previously the day before I explained to him that I had an appointment orginally scheduled with him for June 29, and explained the situation with the lexapro to him. I also let him know the dosage of Trazadone really wasn't always working for me that more often then not after taking the one pill at bedtime that 2 or 3 hours later I was still not able to sleep and then I'd end up taking another pill to try and go ahead and sleep. I told him in the past they had given me Buspar and that it seemed to help me with anexity which is what it was originally prescribed for previously. So he stated that Buspar was formulary and wrote me a prescription for Buspar 15mg to be taken twice daily, also in addition to that he increased the Trazadone from 50mg to 100mg and stated that I could take 1 or 2 tablets at bedtime.   \nAfter my appointment I stopped by the house and called Alex and explained that I was going to be having the IGIV at the Cancer Center all day Wednesday and had no transportation on Thursday and asked if it was possible to pick up my food basket on today and he stated that it would be okay to do that and then from then on out my regular pick up day would be on Tuesdays. I headed out to Poverello stopped by the health department and dropped off my prescriptions and then headed home and dropped off the food. I then stopped back by the health department and picked up the prescriptions and then headed back over here to Patti & Cathy's house.     \nJune 16, 2004 - Immune Globulin IV    \nI woke up this morning at 7am, got dressed and stopped by my house, I picked up a huge container of sliced Mangos, a bananna, an orange and a blueberry muffin and headed to the Cancer Center for my  Immune Globulin IV  (IGIV) at the Center Center.   Upon registering I was taken back to the treatment area and told to choose a lounger I felt comfortable in, they explained where everything was located the restrooms, the nourishment center (where I could store my lunch, find boost and insure, and find juices) they even had a little video libary where I could choose a movie to watch during my treatment. I immediately picked out Jumanji with Robin Williams. The nurse (John) came over and asked if I had ever had  IGIV  before? I stated that I hadn't ever experienced a treatment before. He was very informative about what he was going to do, he explained they would infuse it very slowly so that I wouldn't have any kind of a reaction, he also told me that before stating the IV that he was going to dispense a couple of tylenol and that in the IV they were going to put benadryl and that this would probably cause a little drowsiness. He offered me a headset for the television and then gave me the tylenol and got the IV kit and started the IV. He didn't lie when he said that it would make me a little drowsy because I was passed out before the movie previews where over and had passed out prior to the movie beginning. I woke up at about 3:30pm and still had a couple of hours of infusion left. I finally finished the infusion about 5:30pm.    \nJune 17, 2004 - Blood Pressure Check    \nThis morning I had a 11:15am appointment with the Comprehensive to have my blood pressure checked however I woke up not feeling that well and felt very overwhelmed so I called up and cancelled the appointment. I told them that I need to come into the center monday to meet with the psychologist and asked if it was okay to have my blood pressure checked when I come in on Monday. It just so happens shortly after that Helen called me and stated that she needed me to come in to sign the application for Tuesdays Angels so that she could submit my application to them for rental assistance. I told her that I really wasn't feeling well, but that I would do my best to make it into the office to sign the paperwork she needed me to sign. I arrived at the office right prior to lunch time, she had the paperwork sitting at the front desk and Maria had me sign the paperwork. I had loaded up the dogs and had them in the car, I intended to take them to Bark Park so they could run around the park unleashed and have a little bit of fun. I hung out at the park for about 45 mins they had a blast playing around in the park. I picked up Patti and Cathy at the airport shortly after 8pm and we all went out to Lesters Diner for dinner. I had bbq pork loin and mashed potatos, split pea soup and rice pudding with iced tea. They dropped me off at my house and we made arrangements to pick up things at the store and discussed them possibly bringing the dog and cat over when they leave for Arkansas, or they might end up renting a car to drive up to Arkansas. I was glad to be home because I was able to call my lover Frank and talk to him on the phone. He has absolutely been solid as rock ever since I told him about my diagnosis and I am really thankful that I have him in my life, for without him I think I'd be totally going insane, without him in my life.",

        "blog_text": "It seems like this week went by me really quickly.  Maybe because R was sick all week and I don't feel like I've accomplished much.  Or maybe just because we've been so busy.  Life's like that sometimes, I guess.  On Friday, while R and her dad were at the dance, I enjoyed the quiet and just relaxed.  But the dance was only supposed to last until 9 p.m.  However, by 10 p.m., they still weren't home.  Now, most people wouldn't think much about that.  They'd figure dad and daughter were just having a good time and stopped for a treat or something.  But, because of past history with my husband's depression and some previous behavior (several years ago, that I'll get to), I began to really worry at 10 p.m.  By 10:30 p.m., I was frantic.  I was praying for R's safety, praying J hadn't had a relapse with his depression, passed out or had a heart attack.  But I also was angry that J hadn't taken his cell phone and wondered if that wasn't intentional, a repeat behavior from several years ago.    Depression is a terrible disease - both for the person suffering from it and for those around them whom he or she loves and who loves them.  Anyone who has dealt with a loved one who suffers from this disease will understand what I'm talking about.  The depressed person doesn't want to own what they do.  Instead, they take everything out on the people around them, feeling justified in what they do.  It's always someone elses fault - how they feel, how things go in their lives, their moods.  Because of these behaviors, and typically their refusal to discuss anything (prefering to just shut themselves off), loved ones find themselves targets and feel the depressed person is always angry with them.  You can't get it right, no matter what you do.  And that's a tough way to live.  Before J's medication was correct and he wasn't with the right therapist, things had deteriorated badly between us.  I felt constantly attacked and, the truth was, he was constantly attacking.  Our future together was very much a long shot back then.    In this other incident a couple of years ago, he had gone to pick R up from an activity and didn't bring her back home for almost 3 hours.  He had intentionally left his cell phone at home.  My parents were visiting at the time and I was frantic and trying not to show them how worried I was.  Of course, he'd done this intentionally because he was angry.  Probably partially about having my parents visiting and that attention was going elsewhere instead of to him.  I don't remember if there was another, specific issue he was angry about because back then, it seemed everything was an unspoken, hidden anger he had about one thing or another and it was always directed at me.  A depressive often takes everything out on their spouses or other family members, refusing to accept responsibility for their own feelings or actions.  Of course, he eventually came home, smug about the whole thing and acting like I was foolish to have been so upset and worried.  But there was a smirk on his face and he knew full well what he'd done and was happy with himself.  Anyway, back to Friday night.  About 10:40 p.m., he called collect from a pay phone to say they were on their way home.  The music had been too loud at the dance and they'd only stayed about an hour.  Then they'd gone to an arcade and then to a bowling alley and they'd just finished their game.  I was still angry, though, because R had been sick and it was so late.  She had to be up relatively early the next day for her Destination Imagination practice and then swimming lessons.  Plus, there was smoking in the bowling alley, she is having trouble with her asthma and has been sick all week.  She was asleep when they got home, so I couldn't bathe her to get rid of the smoke smell.  She woke enough to tell me she'd had fun, though, and that it had been her decision to leave the dance.    Now, the part I felt bad about with all of this was that my husband has come a long, long way with his illness.  He's not suicidal (although I'd never have let him take Rachel somewhere alone if I'd thought he was - and you do come to recognize when they are not well), he's not in a depressive state, he's doing extremely well coping with life as a person without this illness would be able to do.  I should have had faith, in Heavenly Father and in him.  I shouldn't have worried.  But he's only really been well for about a year now.  Only really been on the correct medication for about a year, too.  And, although he was a bit upset with me, he understood why I was feeling the way I was.  A year or so ago, he would have made that into a serious crime on my part.  But, he took responsibility for what he's done in the past by accepting that it was normal for me to feel the way I did.  That I require time to learn to trust him, to believe that he will not relapse and our family begin to deteriorate again.  I am grateful to be in a relationship with him now that allows me my emotions without serious consequences (as long as they are normal and not excessive, of course).  That's something I didn't have for a long time in my marriage.  And it's a good feeling to know it's okay to feel however it is I'm feeling and that I don't have to hide it.  So, this beast called depression can't have us.  It can't have our family.  It can't have him.  As long as we work hard at our marriage and family, and he keeps working so hard on himself, we'll survive this beast and be better for it.",

In other words, I love freedom. esp now, I do not wanna be tied down by commitments of any kind @ all!! Forgive mi if I've neglected anyone of u in any way. I can't even commit myself to the one & onli God, wat do u tink? Hee! Admit once again tt I'm a sinner.  But I nv like the nick 'WiNd'. Can't realli explain myself. Perhaps it's 'coz wind comes and goes wifout leavin' an impression (unless it's tornado or typhoon... Hee!!). I love attention. This might be the reason y I like to act silly or make a fool of myself. I would alwayz be the source of energy for my peers and loved ones. I dun like seein' anyone dear to mi gettin' hurt or sad 'coz I love myself more than anyone else. 'coz I know tt if they feel down & out, I will feel worse. I would rather give them wingz. Wingz to fly. Wingz to tide them over the troubled time. Wingz to help them overcome their difficulties. End of the day, all I want in return is juz regconization. Mabbe juz a frenly gesture to show tt I'm appreciated. tt would suffice. Realli.  In the proccess of growin' up, I've received a number of 'wingz' from lotsa pple. I'm realli thankful for tt. One person I realli appreciate is Mel. I wanna thank her for being my first love, for all the beautiful memories tt we created together and for initiatin' the painful break-up tt made mi realised the importance of cherishin' watever I haf now. I've learnt to be more appreciative of thingz and be grateful to each & every moment in life. I've leant tt sumtimes to love is to let go of this love. More importantly, I've leant how to move on. Even when sumtimes I'm flyin' wifout wingz, I can rest assured tt I can still take off. I may not haf wingz, but I'm WiNg. My mission is become wingz for pple. @ the same time we soar 2gether. Isn't tt more wonderful than flyin' alone?  Durin' my selection camp earlier on last month, we were asked to write a letter to our loved ones. I wrote one letter for my mum, which is kinda expected. I've wanted to write one for Kiki, but decided to vanish the thot 'coz wat I haf for her is no longer love; juz guilt perhaps? Eventualli, I wrote sumtin for Mel and it goes exactly like this:   'Dear Mel,  Nothing impt. Juz tt I'm attendin' my propective company's selection camp and we are required to write a letter to our loved ones and the third person tt comes to my mind is YOU!!!

Sumhow, the letter could haf been more sentimental or touchin', but I decided to leave these elements out 'coz I wanted her to feel appreciated for all tt she's done instead of gettin' emotional and all. Keke! Anyway, the letter was not delivered to her for sophiscated reasons so thot of postin' it here instead.   Other than Mel, I tink I've sum other pple to thank as well.

It's call  aka 'WiNg' in English.      翅膀   同样的机场　不同世界  同样的咖啡　不同味觉  同样的我和我　都少了一些  看飞机划过天空　不见了   用你给我的翅膀飞　我懂这不是伤悲  再高都不会累　我们都说好了  用你给我的翅膀飞　我感觉己够安慰  乌云也不再多　我们也不为谁掉眼泪   空气中藏着　你的香味  回忆里躲着　你的眼泪  最后拥抱的温暖还有一些  我拖着行李往前一直走   看一看回忆  是云朵　一朵朵的飘过  若想要回头　就无法翱翔,    'Old friends pass away, new friends appear.

        "blog_text": "I've been thinking about B all day because of our conversation last night. We rehashed my dilemma about Mike, but I finally did come to a conclusion.  I've been thinking all along that I need to be Mike's friend in order to help him.  B pointed out to my last night (and the night before) that not communicating to him would be best for him and for me.  It would force him to consider why all his 'friends' are avoiding him and eliminate a source of stress for me at the same time.  I'm glad that B pointed this out, because I had never considered this point of view before, but I see now why this is true.  So I've basically decided not to communicate with Mike anymore at all.  So, problem solved, right?  I was totally ready to leave this topic behind, but B didn't seem as ready to move on. He seemed really troubled that I would be willing to 'hurt' myself if it meant helping someone or making someone happy. It's true that this part of my personality resulted in an unhealthy relationship with Jerry (among other factors), and this is something that I need to work on.  Given that, I was really hoping that B would be willing to work with me on this and keep me from making similar unhealthy decisions in the future. Afterall, that's what friends do, right?  Instead, he thought that maybe it's not healthy for both of us to be in this relationship while I'm working on my 'self-preservation' skills (as opposed to expending myself for others).  It seemed like he was applying this weakness of mine to ALL areas of my life--as if this weakness is an indication of who I am as a whole person.  I tried to tell him that this weakness is a SMALL SMALL part of who I am and all I need is help and encouragement from him and my other friends to overcome this.    What troubles me is that he was so QUICK to doubt the future of our relationship when he found out that I have this fault.  Is our relationship so fragile?!?!  I asked him if he would be willing to help and encourage me or if this was something that he can't handle about me (which would mean an inevitable breakup).  What he said completely shocked me.  He said, 'I DON'T KNOW'.  Why doesn't he know whether he wants to work with me on this?  Why is he so surprised that I have faults!?!  I was really hoping that when these faults surfaced, he would want to be my source of strength.  Why isn't he sure if he wants to play this role?  If my boyfriend isn't sure if he wants to encourage me, who else on earth do I have?? There are big tears in my eyes right now because it breaks my heart that he would have so little faith in our relationship and most of all, that he doesn't want to help me with my weaknesses.  I have so many of them, and what will happen when he discovers those too?    He said that sometimes he thinks that we are so different. It's true that we are different, but I think that ADDS to our relationship, not detracts from it.  I feel like I can constantly learn from him because of our differences, and I'm very interested in what he has to say.  He called me 'stubborn', which is true, but I don't think I was being stubborn with him at that time.  I was just trying to make sure that he understood my point of view.  He doesn't have to agree with it.  If I were truely stubborn, then I wouldn't have even listened to him when he pointed out that not talking to Mike would be best for both of us.  Instead, I DID listen and I even ended up agreeing with him.  Maybe he thought that I was only agreeing with him because I wanted to make him happy, not because that's what I truely believed.  But that's not true!  I really believe for myself that talking to Mike isn't healthy and that's why I've made that decision.  It's true that I am influenced by people, but I also am capable of making my own decisions.  How could I be a good vet if I weren't capable of making independant decisions!?!    Despite all of this, I still want to be his girl. Even when I was expressing my opinions, B still listened well (at least in the beginning when he wasn't that sleepy).  He never raised his voice at me, although I could tell there was frustration in his voice.  He ultimately wants what's best for me. I know that he was frustrated because he doesn't want to see me hurt anymore.  But I do hope that he will develop more tenacity when it comes to our relationship and not be so quick to doubt its 'rightness' when our differences surface (which they inevitably will). Does this mean that he's trying to find any excuse to break up with me?  I didn't think so because he's so good about telling me how happy he is with me and how amazing it is that we're together.  I didn't think he was that unhappy with me...but then why would he even suggest that we break up?  The very thought makes me want to cry, but most of all, I want to talk to him.  I hope he calls me soon....",

She's confused on how she feels; she loves me or she's uncertain. She's scared because she doesn't know whether or not we'll make it. Of course she's allowed to be scared, but you're not supposed to know. Unless you're a seer and can see the future, but who wants that power anyway? A lot of her decision making lately is due to her being influenced by whores, sluts, or weirdos. But that's beside the point. Two days ago, I broke up with her.

And I do mean crying; I'm quite the emo. I just figure the best way for her to decide whether or not she wants to be with me and walk into the unknown and figure shit out as we grow, is to give her the chance to try out not being with me. If she hates it and me being away kills her and she can't stand being around anyone else, if she's sure she wants to be with me, then we'll try again. If she's still not ready, I'm going to shut up and back off, let her figure it out for herself b/c the only way you figure things out when you're single is...you do it alone. But I'm still going to help her. I still love her. I...really miss her. I can't stand being single without her. It sucks, cause there's always a possibility someone else will come along and take her from me while she's single, even though she says there's no chance and doesn't want anyone else. That's where I'm confused. She doesn't want anyone else  and  she isn't sure if she wants  me .

        "blog_text": "So the Gay Marriage Ban Amendment to the Constitution of the United States entered discussion phase in the Senate Friday.  Being totally fine with the idea of gay marriage, and not wanting to generalize, I became curious as to what arguments against gay marriage have actually lasted long enough to be kicked around on our great nation's legislative floor.  What I found was surprising!   Well, not really surprising at all.    In Baehr vs. Miike (Hawaii, First Circuit Court, 1996)  many of the same arguments the Bombs-And-Jesus crowd are slathering about on Capitol Hill were made by the Director of Hawaii's Department of Health.  In short he denied them marriage licenses not based on law but for the following reasons, which I will shred like Gator  in part and parcel:    Marriage == an institution between one man and one woman.   Okay, so unfortunately someone let a law get passed recently,  a Federal Law , that uses this language. This law defines the words 'spouse' and 'marriage' for the purposes of Federal law as thus:   Section 7.  Definition of 'marriage' and 'spouse' 'In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling,  regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and  agencies of the United States, the word 'marriage' means only a legal  union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word  'spouse' refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or  a wife.   According to this law, so long as we call it by some other name, and the newlydudes don't refer to each other as 'spouse' in legal documents, everything should be fine, right? They'll get all the same bonuses and penalties for being married, and that would be okay with everybody?  Suppose that one or two words were changed in this document - say 'marriage' was suddenly defined as 'a union between one Jewish woman and one red-haired man, or one left-handed woman and one punk-rocker man.'   Or, even better, how about this: 'a union between one Democrat and one Republican of the opposite sex.'  I know what you're saying, you're saying 'That's totally arbitrary!  Also, what if the Republican man can't find any Democrat women he likes?'  Well, what if, indeed?  I guess he could simply stop being Republican, change the way he's built, and become someone entirely different with totally different viewpoints and opinions and ideas, so that he finds the Democratic woman more palatable!  Sounds terrible, doesn't it?  How could you ask that of someone?!  Well how in the hell can you expect homosexuals to do the same thing?   I'm appalled that a bill like this would even get onto the floor.  And compared to what the GOP is after currently, this doesn't even seem that bad.  It pains me to remember that Clinton was in the White House while this bill was passed.  Many shadowy legislative ninjas refer to this law as a 'victory for state's rights' which in a circuitous way it is and isn't.  Sure, Texas doesn't have to legitimize anything Massachusetts does, but also, by the way, here is how marriage is legally defined as told to you by the Beasts On High.  Its bears the distinction of being supportive and destructive to both a central governing power and what I like to refer to as 'States that get the vapors'.    Marriage is for procreation.   Oh, shit.  Really?  They better come and get my wedding ring, then.   A short look at this will inform you  that there's 1 single parent for every 100 people in the United States. Total, not out of parents or adults, but 1 in 100 out of the total population. Also, plenty of teenagers are getting knocked up and pumping out units without being married!  Shouldn't these people all be machine-gunned or something?  They are eating up the benefits of marriage without bearing the religious responsibility, what Bush ponders as the weighty cornerstone of civilization, and obviously should be shaved and painted like savages.    Same-sex couples aren't the optimum environment in which to raise children.   The punchline here is that most average households in America aren't the optimum environment in which to raise children.  I can't tell you how many good, Christian, upstanding citizens let their 2 year olds run around with a 2-liter and a bag of Cheetos.  Or how many regular church-goers I know get drunk and punch up on their kids like Subway Frequent Eater tickets.   Hetero People that hold true to the American Family Values Religiomatic Platform  TM   in their hearts are sometimes also bad parents!  Imagine how scandalized!   I'm not saying that only Christians beat their kids or refuse and fail to parent them.  I'm saying that most people mistreat their kids.  The three kids I know with gay parents at home are in better shape, are more respectful, and are far more bright than any of these hetereo-raised future tax payers.  And no, they aren't all tiny gay babies or pre-teens.  Oh, and PS, the 12-year old girl raised by the Gaymos certainly doesn't dress like the gutter trash hetero-produced tweens I see at the mall.   Have you seen  some of the shit  kids are wearing these days ?  You're lucky I couldn't figure out who sells the high-heel hooker boots to little girls, or else I'd have a link to that as well.    Gay relationships are immoral, and the sanctity of our awesome American family values must be protected!    We here in the US fight the good fight for the sanctity of marriage and our family values!  In fact, we fight so hard,  the United States pwnz other countries in the divorce rate category .  This argument is supported only by the moral constructionism found in Judeo-Christian religious beliefs, which have no place in a legislative argument.  There are multiple provsions in the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights that provide protection from religious persecution; that's how this country was started.    MC Bush spun up in his bumpin' radio broadcast  this pearl:   If courts create their own arbitrary definition of marriage as a mere legal contract and cut marriage off from its cultural, religious and natural roots, then the meaning of marriage is lost, and the institution is weakened.  Arguments against:   Any man-made definition of an intangible concept (like marriage, for example) is arbitrary.  The only explicit power the United States Government has ever had concerning marriage is as a mere legal contract.  Church and State are supposed to be strictly forbidden from intermingling, even though it is quite obvious that Jesus built the Bush Election Hot Rod.    The concept of marriage in the world's oldest religions and cultures contains ideas most White Judeo-Christian Taxpaying Weasels would scarcely be able to contain their lunch at.  Multiple wives, savage circumcision, funeral pyres, bridal burning - these are the cultural and religious roots of marriage, you fool.  Christians and some of their more archaic moral ideals are both a chronological and populist minority.    Marriage has no natural roots.  It is largely symbolic and has tax definitions.  That's about it.  The meaning of marriage is a largely personal thing.  To some it is a lifelong promise of something like romantic team loyalty and good sportsmanship.  For others it is a political licensure to appear normal and square.  For some it means nothing at all but obligation.  The institution and meaning of marriage are only as strong and sharply defined as the participants commit to making them.  I know some animals who only got married so they could go to swinger parties.   Listen, I don't want to slam anybody's religion.  Seriously, we all need something to believe in, and I'm not going to tell you that what you want to believe in is wrong.  What DOES happen to be wrong is any sort of religious involvement or participation in our government at any level.  The separation of Church and State is clearly defined and is there for a deluge of really, really good reasons.    Marriages are for ensuring the continuation of the species.    Saying this is equivalent to saying that people who get married and don't have kids threaten the very institution of marriage.  Again, this goes back to the procreation argument.  There was no 'must hump' clause in my marriage license.    Marriage is traditionally a heterosexual institution.    Talking about tradition in America is asking for trouble from smartasses like me who pay even a cursory amount of attention to history.  The widespread murder of Indians, the burning of women at the stake for witchcraft, the total disregard of care for the environment, slavery, segregation - all traditional American institutions.  Obviously, in most cases, heterosexual marriage isn't quite as terrible as these things, and  some people, like John Ashcroft, seem to think things like slave states weren't all that bad.   This argument is totally silly.  It also used to be a tradition to spit in your hand before you shook on a deal or to marry your brother's wife if he died. I'm not even going to talk about this anymore.      Same-sex marriage is an untried social experiment.    So was colonial rebellion against Great Britain.  Also see letting women vote, letting blacks use the same bathroom as whites, and disco.  We're batting .750.   Gay marriage has been legal in Denmark since 1989.   Many studies  have been done in Europe about divorce rates, marital fidelity and general differences between gay and straight marriages in this nation that has no problem with men getting married to men, women to women, etc.  They have overwhelmingly found that gay couples get married after being together longer, are older at the time of marriage, and stay together much more than hetero couples.  They are also happier in general.  The adultery rates are far lower.   This might come as a surprise to many of you in the God Hates Fags crowd, but when they legalized gay marriage in Denmark, the moral fiber of the nation did not destroy itself, there wasn't anarchy in the streets, and no one has applied to marry their dog.  Also, and I understand this is a fear for many of you, but rest assured that no heterosexuals were forced to marry homosexually.  It is nice to know.  This argument comes from religious figures most of the time, and that isn't surprising.  Just referring to allowing gays to have the same rights as straight people as a 'social experiment' sickens me, and it should sicken anyone with any sense of decency.  These people should be tied into sacks and thrown in the river like runty puppies.    Same-sex marriage would start us down a 'slippery slope' towards legalized incest, bestial marriage, polygamy and all kinds of other horrible consequences.   As I just stated, none of these things have happened in Denmark.  In fact, Denmark joined Bush's  Coalition Of The Willing  and helped him carry the flaming sword to the Axis of Evil.  Lets consider this.  Terrorists are, in Bush's own words, enemies of everything we hold dear and civilization itself.  Also, gay marriage will unravel civilization.  Denmark allows gay marriage.  Hence,  DENMARK IS A TERRORIST STATE.  THEY HARBOR IDEALS THAT GO AGAINST THE VERY NATURE OF AMERICAN LIFE.   God knows I'm writing a letter as soon as I finish this piece.  They're fucking terrorists, man.  Obviously we can't consort with them anymore, because they will send us down a slippery slope where all men will be lined up like circus seals!  WE WILL ALL PLAY THE RUSTY TROMBONE AND FUCK OUR SISTERS AND CATS IF WE CONTINUE TO CONSORT WITH THE DIRTY DENMARKIACKS.    Granting gays the right to marry is a 'special' right.      I still think forced integration was a mistake. As a government action, I think it was detrimental to whites and blacks. And left alone, it'd have come along -- if you look at the football teams in North Carolina, I tell you, there's scarcely any room for a white boy on 'em!'   -  Sen. Jesse Helms, December 2, 2002  Straight people can get married. Gay people can't.  Both are humans and as thus are equal in the eyes of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights.  Treating them like second class citizens is no better than saying something like 'Uppity Negroes have no right to touch our white women. Or vote.'  You silly Cro-Magnon prosophobes.    Sodomy is illegal.   If I could throw every sodomite in jail, I would be the first in line to serve my time.  And it would be a very,  very  long line.  Guess what, hetero nation!  Sodomy isn't just the buttsex between two men.  It is also any sort of oral or anal copulation at all, even between men AND women.  So, if gay people can't get married because of the possibility that they will sodomize each other (which, as a side note, is legislation based upon a potentiality, a lawmaking concept that no one in their right mind would agree to) then the logic stands that anyone who may sodomize each other can't get married at all.  So that means no more marriage.  And no more blow jobs.  And no more investigating the little man in the boat, if you know what I mean.  Although I guess people with no mouths or assholes could get married.  So there you have it.  No marriage for anyone that has a mouth or an asshole, and especially no marriage for anyone who has both.    Terrific Conclusion To This Awesome Report   To sum up, if gay people can get married they aren't going to force you or your kids to have sex with dogs.  Denying them the right to marry is treating them as inferior beings, lesser than their heterosexual counterparts.  All they want is the same rights that straight people have, and there is no good reason, legal or otherwise, that they should not have these rights.  All people in America supposedly have identical rights and opportunities.  I know this is bullshit, and you know this is bullshit, but we're talking about class warriorism when we say that, separating the wolves from the herd.  In the American lexicon of history, we have always been a self-correcting organism, always eventually recognizing our gross impropriety and fixing our blind, frantic mistakes to some extent or another.  The only problem with our current situation is that the blind, panicked animal has the reigns - this time McCarthy sits in the West Wing and shakes his self-righteous fist from a position that seems politically invincible to self-inflicted damage he shouldn't be able to withstand but somehow is.  It is unfortunate.    Nixon was crucified for less than this.",

If you read my husband's blog (www.sevenbates.blogspot.com) you probably already know that we have put down a deposit on an apartment. If not, WE PUT DOWN A DEPOSIT ON AN APARTMENT!! My brother and his wife moved into some decent little townhomes near here and the rent is very reasonable. We went ahead and applied too and got approved. I guess today our friend Jared found out that he got approved as well. So now we can have our own little community parties and stuff. It should be fun.  The apartment is a little on the small side for 4 people, but bigger than our one bedroom we had before. The kids will have their own room finally, something I am very excited about. I haven't been alone with my husband in bed for a long time. I know I know, it's not like the kids will all of a sudden not be in bed with us, but at least I can pretend for a little while. And the chances of actually getting to sleep in something other than my granny jammies are much higher. My parents regularly either look in to see if we are awake or come in our room as it is now. Not such a good situation since 7 sleeps naked usually.   We'll have 2 bedrooms, 1 1/2 bathrooms, a nice kitchen with room for a small table and a workable living area. There is a great closet under the stairs where I can stash some random stuff and the kids' toys when we don't want it all out in the living room. We're going to have to reevaluate some of our furniture and definitely purchase some new stuff. I'm really just looking forward to having somewhere to call mine. It's been so long since I've had that. In fact it's just a couple months shy of a year since we moved out of our home in Monrovia. That was so hard to do. I still feel like crying when I think about it. It was our family's first home. 7 and I at first in the studio downstairs. Then we brought both of our babies home to the one bedroom upstairs. We had the street fair to go to on Friday nights, the park, the library, the movie theater, the coffee shop, the grocery store and various restaurants within walking distance. It was almost perfect and I will always miss it. We actually plan to move back there some day. Of course, we'd much rather have a house, but the location of our little pink apartments couldn't be beat.  Ok, enough misty watercolored memories. OOOH!! 7 got us the tickets to the Barenaked Ladies show after all!! We're going!!!!! and I'm just a little excited. Can ya tell? I love them so much. I told 7 we needed to get the albums we don't have already so I can learn the words to all the songs. I just want to be prepared. I have this weird thing about being prepared for things. I get so anal about it at times that I'll ask things like are there more than one door on the building I am going to so I can't possible walk into the wrong place. I like to have all my bases covered. I pretty much don't want to go to the concert and either not know the words or be singing the wrong words and have the other fans think I'm some sort of weenie. Not that any of them will even be remotely thinking about me at all. But still.   Ok, dad looks like he wants to go to bed, and the computer is in his room after all so I'll close.

I've been seriously thinking about raising him at least an inch, and possibly taking him back to his original ride height.  If I bought stiffer springs I'd still have that nice road feel, just my butt, and tailbone, would be spared a bit.     I start my new job one week from today, so this is good.  I told the lady at the interview if I got that position I wouldn't be able to work August 5 or 6 as I was going out of town for a concert, and there was no way I was missing it.  She was cool about it and that was when I first found out the job didn't begin until August 11.  I figure you only live once so I'm going to stop worrying about work and shit.  The only thing I want from life is to have my two Ph.D's someday.  Is that too much to ask?  I didn't think so.   Alrighty, I'm feeling tired again so I'm going to try that sleep thing once more.",

        "blog_text": "After a long time, atlast my hands clicked 'create a new post', and to add to earlier listed reasons of weblogging, this time the motivation is very different. Sat to write my thoughts, or say to capture my ideas to get myself reminded of it in future. Unlike many people, I do not write a diary, instead my thoughts flow thru e-mails, sms, talk, or penning on the last a few pages of nearest found notebook, but the problem with that is its hard to retrieve and that doesn't serve as reminder. Yeah, I have tried outlook 'task' mechanism too but that works only in office.... ok, whatever after this background and justification of my log I shall come to the point. As told by the title of this blog, sometimes I struggle with myself to get the answers to this question, that how long can we or should we wait to start doing something meaningful for this society? When I say society, its scope varies widely which starts right from the people around me and upto the thought of this whole world as society. Very recently for past couple of months I have extended my current scope to global society. Well, but this idea is not that wide scoped, instead it has a boundary of a village or a town in India, specially not around Bangalore. Yeah, so I was thinking of establishing some kind of school level science lab for my village. More specifically, my idea is not to make a school style lab instead to bring up a workshop which has basic scientific principles demonstrated in practical and meaningful ways. It will also have basic machine tools and ofcourse a x86 computer dabba. The ultimate purpose of something like this is to bring-in the awareness of science and nurturing engineering thinking in people right from the beginning and in the way which will be useful to them. Yes, it would be open to all and will have all the motivational fundas those are needed to pull the people inside the structure. There won't be any fee, or may the minimal fee which is generally needed to inculcate discipline. I have no great expectations from this, other than just making people aware of the things what they generally don't see, or get scared to when see in a city. Its like just giving information and once they have information eventually they will start developing interest in it. But, I am not looking forward for some great breakthru or something like this, I just want to create some fumes and lets see how everybody reacts. By now we all have realized the fact that access to information is the key to growth and interest, otherwise how each of you started this blog thing, or why anthropologists try to lobby against MTV and other channels like that? When information is available, it takes up some cells in your brain and as the brain does a brute-force search at times, these cells happen to get refreshed and influence the results of queries, and then slowly becomes significant enough to influence your interests and decisions. Pardon me for my own crude explanation of 'how brain works', atleast do not tell it to Manik. Ok, so now its time to think about the logistics. Well, the first thing I do whenever this kind of idea hits me is to pick the phone and talk to my father and trouble him to go to our village and then talk to people there and then come out with a appealing proposal with cost and feasibility, BUT this time its not possible, coz I am in different time zone and he should be asleep by now. So, I have sent a mail to me to serve as reminder for taking this thing forward after coming back to Bangalore. Its strange that I get so much of impulse of doing something like this and most probably once I am back to Bangalore, I would be far too busy in other 'more important' tasks and all these stays in blog or task lists. There I have to convince my girlfriend to marry me, have to stay in office for long hours though without much productivity, worry about food and accomodation as if I do not have those already and do all the other things those 'sound' more important to me. Then I'll think that, let me get settled in life properly then I'll do all this... and the life goes on without reaching to a 'settled' frame of mind forever and the wait never ends. Will there be any moment in our life which will bring up the priority of this thought above other ever-lasting worries of life? How great we need to be to start doing something for the people who live hundred times below our so called greatness? I salute people like, Dr. Devi Shetty, Dr. V J Kurian and Anna Hazare.",

I cant help but wonder what my life would have been like if I had kept my membership to the general public... and then I shudder. I like being me, most of the time anyway. But then again, who knows who I am? I dont even know anymore. Maybe that's part of growing up. Or maybe the temperature of the room is affecting my higher thinking abilities. Either way, I feel like I'm missing something. I don't really connect with people, and when I do, it's only people who have equal or higher thinking capabilities. I mean, should I connect with some bimbo and start giggling in audaciously high tones to keep a certain status quo? People don't understand me . I like being me. I want to be me. I don't have to go to a public school to become  somebody.  They think that I'm so anti-social and I'm not. I have personal preferences, just like they do. What's the frikin deal? Please, I want everyone just to grow up. Your friends don't make you . Just for once pretend that your life isn't about them. Don't ask for their opinion, don't take their advice.  Be yourself . But then again, who are you? If you've let your friends dictate your life this whole time, how are you supposed to find yourself? When it really comes down to the line, you'll find that your exactly the opposite of what you could be.  Some people say that your friends make you. That makes it sound like your so co-dependant, that you have to have friends that make who you are.  No.  No one makes anyone, it's all foma(lies). But there are on occasion, people who will affect your life, and for those people you can be truly grateful or ungrateful too. I do not understand what the problem is. Why? The eternal question of mine that will never be answered. Think what you will of me,  I dont care anyway . I have a life to live, and I intend on living it to my, yes my, fullest potential. Does this mean that I have no friends and I sit in my room all day? No, I have friends. I enjoy having friends. But my friends don't make me. Don't get me wrong,  I love my friends . Its the people who don't know me, and think that they do, that really set me off.  Sure, everyone has certain feelings about my homeschooling, but that doesnt mean they have to share them with me. When they ask if I want to go back, I always say no. Why dont I want to go back? For the same reasons that you stay.  Its John Galt syndrome  why give in when I have so much potential? Granted, I know that High School for alot of people is a 'learning expierence' and they will never forget the memories from there. And I realize that alot of people can maintain an identity of sorts through High School. These people are inspiring. But just because I chose not to have to fight to keep that in a public school does not mean that I am a weird and anti-social person. I am doing this for  myself , no one else will benefit. Is that selfish? No. I am me and I fight for that which can't be seen.  Identity.    You might think that this blog entry was a total waste seeing as no one is likely to ever read it.

        "blog_text": "Well...life has been different.  The past 2 weeks involved taking care of funeral preperations.  I got a chance to see my Grandma for the last time before she was cremated.  I was really scared.  It was just a short viewing for the family so she wasn't going to have any makeup on...which scared me.  She had already been dead for about 5 days..I was scared that she would look fake.  I was really amazed at my grandmother's look though.  She didn't look dead at all...she looked like she was sleeping.  She didn't look pale.  I'm glad I decided to go.  I got to say goodbye to her.  Ok, I know this sounds crazy but maybe I was just in some sort of denial while I was there.  I could swear that her stomach was going up and down at an even pace as if she were breathing.  I pointed this out to my family and they could see it too.  My cousin said it was because she still had air inside her body.  I know that's true but it was tripping me out cuz it was so steady and even.  Then I was touching her beautiful hair (she always had better hair than any of her children, or grandchildren) and all of a sudden she lets out a burst of air through her mouth.  I stepped back and sat down cuz I felt like I was going crazy, I was starting to convince myself that she might be alive and just sleeping.  To this point I had not felt her actual skin.  I guess I had to though.  So, I didn't continue thinking 'maybe she's still alive'....so finally I touched her forehead and felt chills throughout my whole body.  She was ice cold and very hard.  My grandpa didn't have the energy and he couldn't handle seeing her again...like that.  He didn't go to see her.  I understand, he cried the whole time and said that's not the way he wanted to see her...he kept saying 'I just want her alive'.  My poor grandpa...he's such a sweet guy and he loved my grandma soooo much.  I cant stand to see him alone.  It breaks my heart and I cannot even imagine the pain that he feels.  Like I told him..I'm very sad and will miss her greatly but I know that know one feels it as badly as he does...our family decided that we've got to keep my grandpa busy.  We don't want to lose him too.  I'm really proud of him though...he is so strong.  I always used to tell my grandma and grandpa that I wanted to marry a guy who loved me as much as my grandpa loved my grandma.  One good thing came out of this sad time.  My cousin who I grew up with, we'll call her J.  J and I were inseperable growing up.  At some point we kind of lost contact with each other and grew in different directions.  Well..I always thought she didn't care much for our family.  I mean...I know our family is not the best family but nontheless they are still are family.  Well..I was wrong.  During this whole time, she has been there for my grandpa and mom just as much as anyone else has.  I got to spend alot of time with her and realized that I really miss having her as part of my life.  I hope that we keep in touch more now.

        "blog_text": "Today I spent most of my day at home after my adventure outside my house at 9am. Skipped the Mediquiz training, I did not want to ruin my holiday by not doing things for myself. In view of the SRS project, I searched pet shop after pet shop, nursery after nursery, and I finally found CATNIP! I felt so accomplished after finally finding it, I guess the harder the journey, the more trying the process, the greater the satisfaction, the fanfare and ecstasy when the job gets done.  I spent the rest of the day contemplating, meditating, and shooting the heads off bots in Unreal. The day went by just like that as I thought of the mysteries of life. I thought about why people act the way they do, I thought about what my purpose on this world was, in the big and small picture, I thought of my past, pondered the present, and envisioned the future. In short I did a lot, a lot of deep stuff with myself.  Life has never been easy. If it was, why would some people choose to call it the greatest tragedy? Is it all but a mockery of death? However, why do some people come out of life as successful individuals with smiles on their faces, but the rest just fade away into the darkness, not making a difference.  The secret must therefore lie in the difference. How should difference be achieved then? We are all human, with two eyes, two ears, one mouth, one nose, and basically the same physical traits, though it cannot be said for some of us, of which my sympathies do lie, the larger human population is still very much physically alike, discounting faces. Hence the secret must lie within the heart.  If one looks at life as a hunt, it will be a hunt. The process will become the thrill of the hunt, and the goals will become the prey. If life was a cruise, the journey will be the rests between each trying port and pit stop. I have always firmly believed, that 'Man creates, fate dictates', quoting myself, the thing is that destiny always begins, in one's hands.  The sacred Choice. To do or not to do. Very often we blame others for our failures, or we blame the world for being unkind, or we would curse fate and say that destiny is unjust. Are we being petty in this case? Have we actually thought about the choices involved. If one chooses not to come into this world, would we? If one chooses not to embark on the journey, would we? It is all about our own choices and the consequences they bear, not that the world owed us justice.  'The world does not owe you a living, after all it came first.' Wise words from Mark Twain. We cannot blame anyone but ourselves for landing ourselves into predicament. To do so means to deny that we believed in our choices. Have we lost faith in ourselves by blaming everyone else? Why not make the best out of each situation? Why do we always look toward the negative, and forget that very often, the positive is within reach, by just stretching out our hands, we may grasp the honey of life?  I do understand that it is tough to look away from the negative, and reach out toward the positive. Though mathematically they are separated by one line, in life, that one line could embody a mile. The journey back may be tough, but it tests one's faith and strength. To hold on to the last moment is not just proving to yourself that you can do whatever you put your mind too, but it also celebrates the strength of the human spirit.  Why were humans not given the speed of the cheetah, the cunning of the wolf, the strength of a bear? We were compensated with something more beautiful than all of that. The mind. The mind is limitless and boundless. It is from there which the light bulb was spawned, it is there where world records are conceived, where theories are developed. Where comes such divine strength as marathon runners push themselves to the limit? It is truly the infinite power of the mind that embodies the true spirit of being human.   Think of light... And you see light.   In a child's mind, we see the beginnings of a destiny. We see hopes, wishes and dreams. Why do we seem to lose those as we grow up? Is it a bane or a boon to lose all those as we find our niche in the modern world?  As we become individuals, it becomes almost impossible to find someone else with exactly the same hopes, dreams and wants. Success is defined a million times by a million people. We try to seek other individuals with similar hopes and dreams, but we often realize that at the end of the day, the person in the mirror is yourself. You have to face your own consequences.  Hence the importance of thinking for oneself. I may sound very selfish here, but if we look into ourselves, we will realize that man, thought gifted with thought, is very selfish by nature. Who would not fight to protect their loved ones or possessions? It is selfishness that causes man to continually improve, to seek higher limits, to fight. To actually talk about universal love would be useless unless one knows how to take care of oneself.  It would be utter foolishness to mention about taking care about others, when one cannot even take care of oneself. Are you being considerate in that case, if you cannot help others take care of their problems in the end, but you give people false hope that you would by showing a helping hand? We see people who are so caught up in caring for others that they forget about themselves. Such is the beauty and the foolishness of the human being.   Do think before you act.   This brings us back to the mind again. With all our ideals, what is the use of determination and the aggressiveness to stand for our ideals when we can't think fulfilling them? We often get lost in this world and we begin to question our ideals as we get to know other people. However why do we find the need to question if belief is all that is and was required? We find the need to think about the ideals that we have, to see them for their realism, not their idealism. What are great ideals if we can't find a facet for them to be transformed into reality?   I feel very sad when I see people reaching out to others, but neglecting themselves in the name of their ideals. As they waste themselves away, I wonder if they would have enough time to see their ideals through.  The world is cruel. If one does not learn to think, then one has truly failed oneself, one's friends and families, one's hopes, and one's ideology.  I see myself 15 years from now, married with 3 children. I see myself with a networth of 30 million. I see myself a overworked, but happy man. I see my wife as a wonderful lady with the sophistication of a aristocrat, but who knows how to enjoy the simpler things in life. I see her as a wonderful cook, and I see many happy hours that I can spend with her in the kitchen, and playing her favourite piano pieces near a fireplace when it is all snowing outside. I see her as an intellectual lady with a beautiful mind of her own, who can give me logic, yet allow me to smother her with emotion.   I see...   Dreams. Hopes. Wants. What are they without making a move to realize them. What are they if one does not live, breathe, eat and drink the dream. What are we if we are not defined by them? Don't tell me two people have the same ideals, because at the end of the day, we are all unique.  Grow up if you have not. As one lets go of the past, roots oneself in the present and then embraces the future, then one can finally say, I am not dreaming, I vision. Clinging on to the insubstantial things, and you will know what they are, will not help you in one bit. Look around you. There are many lights, all you have to do is to reach out and grab one.  We come into this world not finding the perfect person to love, but learning to love the imperfect person.  To Huiwen, EQ, Joy, Deb, Fruz, ET:  My sword and service will lie with all of you, always.  To Ming, Chee, Qadir, Colin:  My good comrades, I look forward to battling alongside you guys, for a long while.   Have faith. Believe like you have never believed before.  To make you happy is what I want, To keep you forever in my heart, To cherish, to love, to hold you there, before, after, now, and then, till the day that my air is spent.  Life is a bed of roses when you are there, you make the thorns seem so easy to bear, my strength to fight lies in your love, you give me the resolve to soar above.

Love is the only power on this earth to cause this much pain and yet still have joy in a few moments between the pain.  Would I have the strength to do what this woman did not do or would I freeze before making a decision.  I hope such a decision never befalls me.

Mike: 'I wanna dance.'  - Dazed and Confused   when i was 5 years old, my mother enrolled me in jazz ballet classes at the rochelle dykstra academy of dance. in my first class patron saint of the school miss shelley proclaimed me a 'natural', and in my first recital i danced front stage centre to the tune of 'copacabana', resplendent in multi-coloured taffeta skirt and a headpiece of plastic fruit. a star was born.   for the next 10 years or so i danced my little heart out, dreaming of the day i would tour the world with madonna, prince and janet jackson. i would let nothing stand in my way. not the fact i could only ace every third attempt at a triple pirouette. nor the fact that i consistently failed to place first in esteddfods (nor second nor third). and not the fact that by 11 years old i had breasts big enough to launch missiles (most dancers are still waiting to hit puberty when menopause sets in.)  that was until i discovered those cursed things that ruin so many a dream: sex, drugs and rock'n'roll (or perhaps in my case boys, vodka and crash diets.) for a while i tried in vain to keep the flashdance dream alive. but turning up to rehearsals hungover and starving is not exactly the most effective way of striving for dancing glory. and so the dream died, along with several million of my brain cells.   and then a few years ago the urge to dance again overwhelmed me. i began open classes at the sydney dance company. i have since been reliving the dream, attending as many classes as time and money allow. however it seems that the more classes i take, the worse i get. admittedly, having changed styles from jazz to hip-hop, i have entered a whole new world, and i'm not sure i belong.  there are no high-kicks in hip hop. no pirouettes. and definitely no step-ball-changes. now its all pops, locks and body rolls. the standard jazz uniform of leotards, fishnets and jazz shoes is eschewed for acceptable hip-hop attire: baggy pants, trainers and trucker caps. and unless you're wearing missy elliot-endorsed brands, forget about it. and gone are the poppy tunes of madonna and prince (janet remains), replaced by the fragmented beats of missy, justin and all artists produced by the neptunes.   'they' say that practice makes perfect. i used to agree with 'them'. not anymore though. now i think 'they're' liars. practice just takes away the illusion of perfection and replaces it with feelings of inadequacy.",

Why put on the makeup the heels, the dresses, if this is just an attempt to lure those we want into our circle?  We want love so badly we sell ourselves out to Dolce and Gabbana for a solution.  But what happens when we cut it out.  When we say, enough, here I am take it or leave it....we really mean....take it or leave it, but please, go with the former, don't leave it, here....let me show you how valuable I am.....look, please.        Do we maintain any hope of love unconditionally or have we watched too many Meg Ryan shows to differentiate reality.  Here's the truth.  Love is easy the younger you are.  a.  You have less past inherently in that you have actually been alive a shorter period.  b.  You have less hangups, and may still have altruistic beliefs.  c.  You have less wrinkles, and flab and GOD forbid proof of your lasting existence.  d.  Less exes accumulated.  e.  No bills, obligations, kids, jobs, i.e., grownup crap you don't like even when you have to deal with it.    Silly kids in college think their 'serious' relationships are the end-all.  No honey, but yes, maybe the end.  Wait til you and your love-of-your-life have a mortgage, and bills, and one of you makes more than the other.  True love, if it exists can transend this.  Flaky 'love' cannot inherently because it lacks the requisite endearment and frankly obligation.  My friends would have me tell you that love is not mortgages and bills, but a feeling.  Yeah, its the feeling that will keep your butts together when one gets laid off and the other has to work overtime.  Not the candles, or bubble baths, no sex can do that, its a form of, for lack of a better word, endeared obligation, you love the other enough to keep them afloat.  You throw them the liferaft first.  True love is perseverance, nothing less, the fact you don't quit, you have problems, yes, you have difficulties yes, but you don't want to wake up with anyone else.  You want to call that person first when you bomb a law school final.  You want that person to walk you to your door every night for hereafter, and nobody else.  You know if they screw up, you hope to GOD they call you first so you can try to help them.  You want them to know you love them.  Love is bigger than an ephemeral feeling, the fleeting tingly butterflies are lust or excitement.  Love is less exciting but more so, because it can be counted on.  You don't have to ask if its included, if they want to go, you know they will be there.  You know they will pull the covers over you the weekend before finals and not get pissed because you were running a fever and tossing and turning all night.  They put their arm around you and kiss your forehead the next day, asking if you want some water, if you are okay.               So thats it.  I think I am in love.  I am.  He doesn't know.  After turmoil and being stood up who knows how many times.  He is the one I want to pick me up for dates and wake up to in the morning.  When did this happen and why didn't anybody tell me.  My friends hate him,  because of standing me up, my dad wants a guy who will want me in a stronger less flaky way.  And here I am. In an un-relationship, with the person I want to share my pillow with, who was dating another before, and partially during my reign, and who I have ridiculous stupid quarrels with.  I love him.  I am actually not just saying that.  I really do, oh God what do I do, he doesn't want a relationship and I will be back in Spain on May 25th.  I cannot even imagine a date with another.

        "blog_text": "neurosis for the morning. Just because you start to find more extensive common ground with someone of the opposite sex over a couple of beers (ok... three on an empty stomach) does not mean that you might be accidentally falling in love. I, in my drunken, suddenly shell-shocked and excited naiveté have mistaken this more than once. Luckily this time the fall brief and minor and was over happy hour so I had time over dinner with a close friend to sober up and come to my senses. I have many girl friends that over the years have complained about not being able to keep any close guy friends because eventually and nearly without fail they guys fall in love with them. In my case it turns out to be nearly the opposite. Almost without fail, when I start to discover something genius and special within another person, most often of the opposite sex, my first instinct is to get terribly excited about them, talk about them incessantly, and last, but not least, convince myself that I must be falling “in love” with them. In fact this happens so often that I rejoice when I hit it off with someone that I don’t immediately find physically attractive. The reason for this being that I assume or try to convince myself that if I don’t find myself attracted to them, I should be able to keep them as a good friend. Maybe I’ve just watched “When Harry Met Sally” one to many times, but I seem to fall into this trap. Maybe it’s all about my incessant need to fall in love. If you need more pop culture references and labels I’ll put it this way. When “Sex and the City” came out all of the women I know rushed to identify themselves with one of the characters in the show. My former roommate was an obvious choice for Carrie with her penchant for spending money she didn’t necessarily have and her on again never truly off relationship with Mr. Big. No one in my group seemed quite ready to identify themselves with Samantha and her uber promiscuous behavior although her frankness about her not only her sexuality but also the rest of her life matched up well with another girl friend of mine. I, however, was left with not one, but two characters that I felt shared my styles, traits and whatnots (one mustn’t forget the whatnots.) I discovered that I am both Miranda and Charlotte. An, unlikely combination I know, and thinking about it makes me want to defend my affinity with that now horribly cliché Meredith Brooks song – I’m a bitch, I’m lover, I’m a child, etc. because isn’t every woman a combination platter. We don’t fit into nice little stereotypical packages of the slut, the domestic, the independent woman etc. But this is getting off the topic. Back to the matter at hand. I identify with Charlotte because of her idealistic and unblemished view of the possibility of true love. Many see this as her naiveté, in fact often I do as well and it makes me question my own life. It makes me question my own faith that I will someday find “the one” and have adventures for the rest of my life with one person, have babies, send them to good schools, bake pumpkin bread, teach them how to ride a bike, and grow old with the same person. It’s a level of commitment that is hard to find these days – but I still believe in its possibility especially when coupled with “true love.” Miranda and I are soul sisters however for the fact that I am utterly and completely terrified of everything that I just wrote above about matching with Charlotte. I am a strong independent woman who does not want to rely on anyone else for anything else – regardless of whether I need it or not. If we want to look into where this came from, the most obvious contributing factors seem to be that the fact that my parents raised me to be an independent thinker who didn’t accept things at face value who could do anything I set my mind to, because they had faith in me coupled with the fact that I have been - alone - single - for pretty much my entire life. Sure I had a boyfriend in high school (who lived an hour and a half away from me and neither of us had cars), and bizarre friendship/relationships in college that I think are just part of college and the fact that I tend to fall for flaky boys, but never a real relationship – never something where we called each other boyfriend and girlfriend or hung out regularly or called each other before we went to sleep at night or knew that someone was there for us. None of this has ever been a part of my life. So because of that I’ve grown to be a stronger independent woman who doesn’t make time for those sorts of things with possible boys I meet, and doesn’t even consciously expect a relationship as a possibility. Miranda didn’t want to commit to a relationship, sure our “histories” are different, but I think the driving force can be the same – fear. So have I really figured anything out by saying these things? Probably not, my character is conflicted. Not that there is anything wrong with a conflicted character – they’re the great ones right? Every story has to have some conflict, mine just happens to be the internal sort. Maybe I am Miranda after all and it really isn’t about my incessant need to fall in love. After all, Miranda was the one who ended up with the career, the baby, and the clever guy with the round glasses and the curly hair. Will these issues get resolved some day? Possibly, after all I’m only twenty-four… and if we’re still going to follow the “Sex and the City” ladies I’ve got a lot of time left to figure things out for myself.",

It's a dreary day outside, and I haven't taken my medication yet - after which I'll be happy again, more energized more productive and less groggy.   I've spent most of the day thinking something really wonderful will happen, but I know it's a set up. I'm thinking she'll want to talk and we'll be wonderful, together - I'll be happy? I don't know if it's possible - being happy with someone. I try to imagine what that would be like and what that would mean for me. I think it means I don't have to work so damned hard to be different - make myself new. I've made so many strides to 'get better' though. I'm here, and I'm learning, and I'm willing to make the changes, to better myself and my current situation - make more money, cook for myself, by myself flowers or easter candy- lots and lots and lots of candy for the addict. I'm doing all the things to make me love myself more so I can possibly love someone else. Maybe it isn't that I don't love myself, it's that I've listened to people tell me that I don't love me. I think I do, more now than I ever have. It's like I'm trying to convince myself.   I bought some groceries today - a little self esteem booster. I did yoga last night, a little self esteem booster, tomorrow I'll do something with my hair - self esteem.   Yesterday in counseling I said I think the proposed moved to Chicago will open some important doors, Like somehow my life will know to improve because the environment itself will be an improvement. The signals will all mix together, and I'll be on this huge cloud overlooking everything I've struggled to overcome. This step is so important. It's a huge statement in my life. It says, 'I will not let being afaid keep me from doing what I need to do.' The attitude starts before I leave. The cello will become less and less of an enemy. It'll be less and less painful for me.   There was this professor yesterday who talked to me about children and language and syntex in relation to music. Kids just do what the hell their told, period. Grown-ups think to damned much. I think to damned much. My special one person project is to find a way to get back that thing we all had when we were kids. We just did whatever the hell we did and we didn't care who was watching or why. We didn't have any real expectations - we just did. That's my mission.   O.K. back to work.",

        "blog_text": "My name is Chrissie. I'm 26 years old. I have two daughters, Chenoa (3) and Cherina (21 months.)  I left my husband in March. He was controlling, manipulative, and verbally abusive. He never let me have any money, claiming that he didn't have any (but he had enough to buy beer,) accused me of stealing money when he'd clearly lost it, hated my friends and family and resented their presence, put me down (my pet name was 'stupid bitch') called me a bad mother, threatened to take custody of the girls if I left him, accused me of cheating on him, threw baby fits when he didn't get his way, and basically worked to suppress and kill anything that was a part of me. And he tells all his female friends via email that all he wanted was for me to love him and want to be with him.  The final straw came when he had a female friend come over to visit him. I found out that day that he had lied to me about how he met her. he had told me that he took the girls to the park, and they met there because our kids approached her kids. However, upon learning her name, I realized that he had been talking to her before that. Her name was in his cell phone for AT LEAST a week prior. And later on, after snooping thru his email, I learned that he had met her on a dating site.  Also that day, I discovered that there was a spy camera in my living room. Up until that day, I thought it was a simple alarm clock. I found the receipt for it when I was cleaning the bathroom.  So I decided to leave. I wasn't going to live in a house with a spy camera and a husband that thought it was OK to cheat on me right under my nose.  I called my mom and asked her to come pick up the girls so I could pack my things. She came and got them, and I started packing at about 3pm. My husband and his brother left at that time as well. It took me a long time to get my head together and figure out what to take and what to leave, and to find boxes... so I was still trying to get things together at 2:30am the next morning, when husband and his brother came back, drunk.  Husband came into the back bedroom where I was, packing. I had the stereo on. He ripped the speakers off the stereo and knocked some things over. I asked him to please leave me alone. he yelled at me, saying that this was his house, and he paid the rent, and he didn't have to do anything if he didn't want to. On and on it went, and his brother got in on it as well. They wouldn't leave me alone. So I told them that if they wouldn't leave me be, I'd call the police. Which I did. And the whole time, his brother was talking over the 911 operator, so I couldn't hear her... threatening me, saying 'well, if this is how you want to handle things, we'll just see what happens' and threatening my brother, who wasn't even involved, etc.  When I got off the phone with 911, they both went outside. I locked the door on them so to avoid any further confrontation until the police arrived. When they did, they banged on the door. I opened it, they questioned me as to what was going on, and before I knew it, I was handcuffed. The police told me that my husband had a red mark on his face, and had said that I slapped him.  Off to jail I went, for something I didn't do. I spent a day and a half in jail. My PR bond was denied... the only reason that could have been was that he told the police he was afraid of me. So my parents bailed me out. He filed a protective order on me, which has since been lifted, filed for divorce, and is now trying to get full custody of the girls, just like he always said he would... and I am awaiting trial for the alleged slap.  So now, I'm dealing with the aftermath of a trainwreck. I'm living with my mom and stepdad, outside Austin. I have a crappy part-time job, and even though I have no rent or bills to pay other than legal expenses, my paychecks are gone by the time I get them. I have no car to get to and from work, so I'm relying on Mom to drive me around. I'm trying to get enrolled in community college so that I can better my life and those of my girls, but seriously... I have NO idea how I'm going to handle all of this. I'm sure I can get financial aid for school, but in the meantime, how am I going to afford to live? I can't stay with my parents forever. They're planning to move 60 miles away from here in the near future. I have nowhere else to go, no way to get there... and who's going to watch my kids while I'm at work and school? I can't afford daycare. I can't afford a car. I can't afford a place to live. I can't even afford my insulin, or to see a doctor. (I'm diabetic, by the way.)  And as far as the girls go... they're being carted back and forth between here and their dad's house every week. I just dropped them off today, and I get them back next week. His mother has left her house and job in Houston to take care of the girls while he works. His brother is living there as well... and I think the woman he's been seeing is staying there. At the very least, she's spending nights over there. I have a neighbor who lives across the way from him, and she keeps her eyes and ears open for me.  Anyway, that's my story. I'm overwhelmed and confused about my future, and even though I want my girls with me, I don't know how I'm going to handle it all. I'm very scared that I'm going to lose them.",

'Nite, lil bit.' 'G'nite.'  I watched my sister step away from my bed, close my door, and patter next door to her own room. *Where's Daddy?* Mommy must be sleep, the crying has stopped, and there's no sound  coming from her room.

I gave myself permission to go inside... just to check on her.  'Mommy?' There was blood trickling from mommy's wrists, her eyes were wide open, and her mouth was too. I didn't cry. I just stood there waiting for her to blink or cough to let me know she was playing a game... one that I couldn't join in on. I pushed her arm, tugged onto her shirt,  still nothing. I felt a scream come outta me 'Charlotte... Charlotte... It's mommy!' Charlotte hurried down the hall, grasped my arm with one hand and held her mouth with the other. 'Step back ciera.' She pulled the covers over mommy's  face, and sat down beside her.  'I have to call 911, okay Ciera.' 'Okay. Mommy's just playing a  game. This isn't like her to play this long.' I knew she was dead, I didn't wanna believe it, couldn't say it... It was there, on my tongue, like new spit waiting to be rid of, but I couldn't say it. 'No, mommy's not playing. She's  dead, Ciera.

        "blog_text": "I was digging through some of the things I had written about a year ago and just filed away on my computer.  What follows may be long but it's worth considering, I think  The Spirituality of Play       Each of us is always in such a hurry to grow up.  When we are five, we can’t wait until we are six.  When we are half-way through our sixth year, we are suddenly “six and a HALF!” and we don’t let anyone forget it!  When we turn 8 or so we start to pick up baseball gloves and footballs and suddenly play has to have rules and comparisons, what is right or wrong, legal or illegal, which player is better, who’s the best on the team, who’s the last one to get picked.  Play becomes serious business.  At age twelve, play is reserved only for sports.  The Barbies and the G.I. Joes and the Legos are all hidden away in the attic or worse…sold off as a grab bag at a garage sale for a dollar.  Next come the teenage years where there is no play because everything is so serious and so much about life and death.  “If Bobby Jones finds out I have a crush on him, I will just DIE!”  Play is forgotten or focused on sports, choirs, school, or plays.  We think we have the world figured out and then tragedy strikes:  we graduate.       In college, we remember how to play for just a little while.   The introduction of new freedom takes us back to when we were able to ride our first bicycle.  There is no curfew, no watchdog, no guidepost, no security blanket for our lives any more.  We are finally adults, standing on our own, making our own decisions, making our first mistakes without the comfort of family.  We find help in the arms of people who were strangers last semester, but after a few months of Introduction to Chemistry and slaving over the Periodic Table together, they have become the sibling we never knew we had.  However, we never play together.  We are too busy studying, working, chasing people of the opposite gender, and worrying about life after graduation.       And, before we know it, we’re there.  We are living on our own far from home…even if it is just a few miles away.  We come “home” to an empty apartment and turn on the television so that we have something to talk about at work the next day.  All the while wanting nothing more than to change out of our “work clothes” and into our “play clothes,” to jump on our bicycle, ride around the neighborhood, and have adventures like we did before.       Some will become adrenaline junkies, pushing themselves to the outer limits of human tolerances.  Adrenaline is a fickle mistress.  As with any kind of junkie, the desire for more will eventually burn them up.  The lengths to which we will go in order to play!       Of course, we think that God is not in our playing.  We remember from 1 Corinthians 13 how that works: “When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; but now that I am a man, I put childish ways behind me.”  The spiritual life is no place for a child.  It is a grown up world of reason and thought and discussion and conversation with scholars and pedigreed people who have paid more money than we have so that they can prove that they know more than we do.        Or is it simply that they forgotten more than we have?  Have they forgotten how to play?  I have never known joy to be an intellectual pursuit…it’s always been a feeling in my heart.  I have never known joy to come from a book.  I have experienced humor, laughter, insight, and many other positive things from a book, but never have I known joy.  Joy comes from experience.  Joy comes from living.  Paul was able to write from prison, “Rejoice in the Lord always!  Again, I say, rejoice!”  Joy comes from a relationship, not a process.       Play is a new spiritual discipline.  It takes effort to shut off everything and play… with God, with kids, with pets, with ourselves (not that way).  To take some time to be active in accomplishing nothing but living the fancies and fantasies of God, listening for the evidences of his love, takes discipline in this task oriented, highly effective world.  The spiritual discipline of play is waiting for Him to come to the houses of our grown-up lives in his muddy T-shirt, blue jeans with holes in the knees, and last year’s tennis shoes, and say, “Can Tommy come out to play?”       Of course I can Jesus.

Bailey (the puppy) is a beagle/dauchsund mix who is 5 months old and 11 pounds big.  I want to personally thank her for taking a scared, anxious, bored woman and showing her that life is about having treats, long walks in the park in the evenings and snuggling.    I thought I would use this blog to explore the thoughts in my head as Bailey and I take life one day at a time.  A little background...  Two years ago in California, I left my husband of 6 years because I realized that I was no longer in love, and more then likely had never been in love.  I was in a job that I hated and in a desperate act of self distruction, I left my marriage and my job with no place to go and no prospects.  A friend of a friend offerred me a job if I would move to DC.  It was a new city, doing a job I had never done before, alone for the first time.  I became very sick and had to be put on medication just to be able to leave the house.  I never thought I would make it.  But here I am almost two years later and I am much stronger then I ever thought I could be.  I am very good at my new job and am making more money then I ever thought I would make and possibly more then I am worth.  I will have my last credit card paid off at the end of this month and overall my finances are stable.  However, I found that I was still very scared and lonely.  I had tried making friends and dating without much success.  Then, three months ago, I got my little dog.  She has given me so much.  She gets me up in the morning and takes me out to Starbucks for coffee.  She sleeps with me at night, which makes my king size bed feel much smaller and cozy.  She takes me to the park every day for long walks, or swims in the river and has introduced me to many new, kind people.  She makes me feel loved and safe and happy.

I know that you can stop the inevitable, but the fact remains that he and I did everything together. We played baseball together, we played basketball together, we golfed together, and even though I moved an hour and a half away, I never really thought that he would just up and leave like he did. I'm not being selfish, I understand why he did it - he has to support his wife and kids - I just take issue with it being so far away and I also think that I would have been better with the whole thing had I not called him last night and found out that he was already in Dallas. For whatever reason, I'm really aggravated by this whole situation which isn't fair to my wife and some of those around me because it's turned me into an A-1 dick. Be that as it may, the fact remains that what Rags and I shared was something special. Something I don't think anybody could possibly understand.

I started this blog as a way to handle my health and issues surrounding it.  I went to a Nephrologist last week.  This is a kidney doctor.  Prior to getting into IU for a hopeful kidney or pancreas transplant I needed to get a diagnosis on my kidneys.  When you know something in your heart and in your mind do you need a diagnosis?  I knew what I would hear because I ahev seen my kidney test results for the past years.  It was bliss to not have 'the diagnosis' over me like a curse of some type.  This is like swimming in the lake hoping there are no alligators when you know they are there.  The diagnosis :  Chronic Renal Failure.  I am going to die.  But when?  My brother died at 37, two years ago.  I always loved beating him at things when we were young. I hate beating him at life.  I didn't ever want to see Steve buried.  I didn't want to carry the casket.  I didn't want to have to find a tie for him to be buried in, deal with the cries of my mother and Steve's children.  At 43, 44 this year I will have 7 years on Steve. I know in my heart Steve is in HEaven.  The last years of his life were a storm but he died with the peace of Christ.  Steve demonstrated in so many ways he was ready to die.  He made preparations for his death.  I was ready to die last year.  I even visited my father in Florida. A healing service was held for me at church and while my body was not healed I felt my Spirit was healed.  I need to accept my health but I don't need to accept death.  It is difficult to take the blood draws, the needle pokes, the pills, the complacency of the health care industry.  This does not include most of my doctors.  I tried then to fight my health and do more than I could.  Jennifer tried to help me.  She gave me something to do and always someone to supervise me. After several accidents and near misses I had to stop driving.  My eye doctor asked in January who drove me to his office.  I had to tell him I did and he suggested I have someone pick me up. After the last mini stroke I accepted my health and my condition.  I am in counseling, which can be a good or bad thing.  Bob Tannehill is my counselor, among others, at Brandywine Church.  I spent enough years in marriage counseling to know that it only works for someone who wants to change a habit or problem.  I did , she didn't.  Most counselors with big degrees have more problems themselves than their patients.  The Occupation with the highest suicide rate is psychology or counseling.  Most of these counselors have the new age view that man is a god and in control of his own universe.  God was not in the equation.  This makes a big difference.  Bob is a Godly counselor, basing his counseling on the Bible.  I enjoy these sessions and learning more about God and his plan for my life.  I know that God wants me to watch over my children and be there for them even if I am a shadow of what I used to be. I feel bad that I am not working or being productive financially. I hate placing the financial burden on Jennifer.  I haven't been able to handle the stress of finances or bills for many years now.  The only thing in my life that I feel I can do is what I am doing...being with my kids, going to church, trying to squeeze what is left out of this useless body.  Any time I give to God or His ministry is gravy and makes me feel useful. The satisfaction gives me some worth in the worthless body.  If I get some new parts and can push awhile longer, I will be glad and thankful for this.  I feel the need to see my children grow up and become adults.

We were poor enough that we ate fruits and vegetables almost exclusively from cans, where milk was never for drinking but only for morning cereal, where a special snack was cinnamon toast or saltines spread with margarine, and dinner might well be creamed tuna or creamed hamburger over toast (which I'm thankful I didn't know the outside the world called 'shit on a shingle' or I would never have been able to eat).    I have very few fond food memories from childhood.  The foods I remember most fondly are those from my early years in northern Minnesota: pasties (before I knew calzones or pizza pockets, we had the pastie [PAST' ee]; a crust wrapped around diced carrots, potatoes, onion, and meat), potica [pah TEET za], a paper-thin sweet bread rolled jelly-roll-style around a filling of cinnamon and finely chopped nuts. My father is a sportsman and I loved his smoked fish and the gamy grouse and pheasants.  Those were formative food memories, distant and removed from what I ate most of the rest of my life.  One food I grew to loathe was turkey.  My mom would always cook up a giant turkey for Thanksgiving when she could, but to me the turkey was the worst part.  Potatoes, stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce, green beans, hot rolls, maybe even real butter and a pumpkin pie with Cool-Whip, oh bliss!  But the turkey?  Dry, coarse, over-cooked and under-seasoned (and that was on the first day, fresh from the oven).  We had turkey leftovers for several days, if not a week.  I still can't say I have fond feelings for turkey.  We were poor enough that a church group brought us a huge box of donated food one Christmas when I was about 13.  My mom wasn't home, and I answered the door.  It was quite a shock to me to find myself standing face to face with a donation box and several youth group members I knew from school.  It was jarring and I felt physically stunned.  Before that time, I knew we didn't have a lot--we didn't have Twinkies or Ruffles or bottles of Coke, we didn't even have generic knock-offs of those things--but I never realized how needy others perceived us to be until that day. I don't remember what was in the box, only that my pre-teen pride was so bruised I swore I wasn't going to eat their charity food, and I ranted to my mother, later, that they should have given that food box to some people who were actually hungry.  Had anyone from the church extended an invitation to dinner, had someone other than my mother cooked that donation box of food and invited us to share it with them, I would have been so much more willing to accept their charity!  I doubt I would have recognized it as charity at all.  The delivery made all the difference, dropping by the house (my house, a house none of those people had ever visited prior) with their charity box made the group feel like good Christians full of holiday spirit, but the change it made in me was quite the opposite of what they intended.  So began my passion for food, not just eating and enjoying it myself but preparing, presenting, and sharing it with everyone I can.",

My pain is nothing compared to this...I don't even feel my physical pain right now, and I assure you there is a lot of pain there. It's the fact that something a lot more important to me was damaged tonight. A man's pride and dignity; my pride and dignity. The true meaning of those words were expressed to me tonight. Right now I can truly say I understand those two powerful words that you can only find personal meaning to.  This may seem frivolous to the one I'm talking about, but it's more then what you think. It's not the fact that I'm o so hurt that I couldn't get the girl I liked, no. That was the least of it. And no it wasn't rejection either, because I was never rejected. I never even made it that far to even be rejected. If you don't know, or haven't even got to that point your life, its more then what your mind is saying is the 'obvious'. Because in this case, I don't think your mind has even expanded to this field of thought, this new level of subconscious. I may be a 'boy', but I do know things, though you may not have even mentally expanded to that level either. Truly being a man is being able to say you tried and strode for what you wanted and what you believed in. I was horribly deprived of that this night. Yah as you may say,'you never had a chance', at least if I tried I could go and say I did try and didn't puss out like a punk. If I like a girl, I will start talking to her, no matter if she even tells me,'fuck off you stupid, ugly shit I'm not interested in you', at least I could say I gathered up my fuckin balls and tried. It's not what  YOU  think is the outcome, its what the outcome is. I never even got a chance to see that. Yes I did like M, and even tiger told me what problems I might run into with her... and you can even ask him, I said I'm going to try anyways. That is truly stepping up, I knew what obstacles I had, yet I still was determined to go on. Even if she would have shut me down and out, at least I could say I tried. That's being a man, facing your situation, though you know the odds may be against you. I only wanted to try, trying and failing isn't what gets to me, it's not being able to try at all. That's what slaughtered my pride and dignity distastefully in front of me as I watched. Rejection isn't a bad thing, but I didn't even get to make it that far. I wasn't even shut down by her, and I don't even think she knows I liked her, not that it matters anymore. That's like getting kicked off the football team, when I wasn't even on the team and never even tried out for it. Look at this situation outside of your little box, think of it from my perspective. Then, and only then, will you truly understand this meaning of a man, and what pride and dignity really is...",

To some extent he is correct, but what he expects 'effective, responsible government' requires'effective, responsible society'. The society is getting what its deserves but the penalty is paid by people like Satyendra Dubey. So the best solution will be to not to have people like Satyendra Dubey.  Support corruption, save a life .  Corporate India does have legitimate fears: for one, cohesion, mutual faith and team play are the key to productivity, and institutionalised Orwellian squealing is its antithesis. Second, there are a thousand ways to victimise squealing employees, but such laws only encourage the incompetent to become whistle-blowers to avoid being sacked. Third, whistle-blowing settles extraneous scores, promotes 'political' subgroups, institutionalises internal and external blackmail, and adds to the predatory powers of our predatory state. Lastly, whistle-blowing results in defensive management, proliferates mindless procedures, and ultimately destroys initiative and risk-taking.     The key point here is that what applies to corporate India also applies to the government of India: a whistleblower law may only work to paralyse whatever still functions in the government. Let's face it, the whole corruption racket works on mutual benefits and fair distribution. What you probably will have with a whistle-blower law is a little benefit and a lot of problems.     So why do we need whistle-blower legislation? Laws don't automatically mean law-abiding societies. That apart, what will the law say that is not already covered under existing fair labour practice legislation ('thou shall not victimise') or, as in Dubey's case, the Indian Penal Code ('thou shall not kill')? So let me put it bluntly: to save a life such as Dubey's all you really need is appropriate and sensitive government response to credible information of corruption in high places, and an effective witness protection programme. These are administrative issues, not legislative ones.    This is not an argument for a whistle-blower law. This is only an argument for effective, responsible government.

So how about scenario #1:  We were supposed to leave for Gatlinburg this morning. Well, since Monday my mother hasn't been able to decide whether or not we are going. One day the answer was 'yes' and the next the answer was 'no'. There was a problem with this. On the second day there, we were supposed to go to the water park. Well, I don't own a bathing suit!!! For goodness' sake I know that that is odd (but in all honestly, mine from last year is too big). That was the only reason that I kept asking her if we were going. I needed to buy a bathing suit if we were! Oh!! And it didn't really help that everytime she was on the phone she was talking to the family that we were supposed to go with! She would sit there and tell Marsha over and over that we were going, then get off and tell me no. What the heck people?! And then last evening she got really mad at me because I had asked her again while she was on the phone with Marsha. Can you blame me? I would kind of like to know what is going on in my life. Arrrr...  Scenario #2: Last night I'm sitting on the couch reading a book and all of a sudden the phone rings. Nothing abnormal about that. The nature of the call, on the other hand, could have gone over a LOT smoother. You see, it was a babysitting call...for me. But I didn't get to talk to the lady on the phone. My mom just volunteered me for the job without even asking me in the first place. What if I had plans for today? Which I did. Well it obviously didn't matter because I had to babysit. And while we are on that topic, I'm going to elaborate. The kids that I have no choice but to watch today, I have watched before. I had no problem with watching them then. My sudden change of heart was due to the fact that their mother never came to pay me. So she has owed me $50 for over a month now. Why should I do her a favor and watch her kids if she still hasn't paid me for the last time? I just don't understand that.  Scenario #3: I have to say that this one is very different from the others. This one makes me sad. Things are great with Paul. Getting better with every day that I see him actually. On Wednesday night I went to his house after my senior portrait meeting. That was so much fun. The power went out and we went to 'investigate'. We sat on his bed and talked for a really long time about nothing in particular. It was really nice. Then yesterday I went over to his house again. We watched a movie and played with his little brother. Once again, it was nice. The whole leaving thing got me down though. And I know how pathetic that is. But he's leaving for vacation sometime today, and I'm going to miss him. I don't even know if I'm going to talk to him while he's gone...and he's going to be gone until the 19th. Then I have band camp. So in all honesty, I don't know when the next time I will see him will be.   Scenario #4: I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT BAND CAMP THIS YEAR!! Not only am I a senior now, but our show is going to be really awesome! Okay, so our theme is pirates (Arrr matey..hehe) and we are doing songs from Pirates of the Caribbean, Song of the Sea Maidens, and something from DCI (Drum Corps International). I can not wait!

I understand that this is what the European Union is doing and we would like to be a part of the Union and so on. How was my exam? Never mind. Actually, I didn't bring up the subject to discuss the exam. The only good part of it was the exam site. It was held at the premises of Istanbul University which is amazingly beautiful. The university lies on the other side of the Bosphorous in what we call 'the old city' where all the grand mosques, cisterns, Hagia Sophia, the Topkapi Palace and the Grand Bazaar are. It's far away from where I live.   In the 3-hour interim between the morning and the afternoon sittings (yes, the exam was supposed to last a total of 6 hours in two sittings held on the same day, never mind how much of it I could take!!), I wandered around 'the old city'. In that part of Istanbul, tourists outnumber the nationals by the way. Strolling around and watching tourists it just happened that I started seeing the city, my city, the way tourists see it. At least the way I think they see it. On the way back home I skipped public transportation and walked all the way down to the seaside and stood there for a long time watching the Galata Tower and the intricate web of old houses surrounding it.

I was completely out of it all and stood there in awe. How lucky I am to be living here I thought.   Then I took the ferry to the Anatolian side and on the ferry I sat outside in the wind and watched the sea and the city skyline. I tried to locate exactly at what points in the picture most of my life is spent. Where I work, where I live, the favorite places I visit. I imagined myself in those places and looking at Istanbul from the outside I felt a stranger although I make miles and go distances in it everyday.   Then everything just clicked into perspective for a split second. I sensed that If I can look at my life, myself, and what I do from the outside instead of drowning myself in daily trivia, everything will become clearer. By zooming out, I will actually be able to bring into focus the things of real importance. New ways to see old things will maybe then appear.",

The competition between collegues fighting for their financial lives in corporations. Competition between siblings. There is competition on the grandest of stages in the Olympics and professional sports. To this day, the purest competition I have witnessed is that of young athletes.   I had the opportunity to witness a junior high track meet yesterday, and I was blown away by the passion and drive of 12, 13, and 14 year old athletes competing against each other and more importantly against their own best selves. Young boys and girls leaving every ounce of energy on the track, then finishing with clenched fists and loud hollers. Pure competition is competing for no incentive other than the right to compete. Take into consideration this story...  A young, smaller than average seventh grade boy competing in the mile run against 20 other boys. After the first lap, he is behind by an estimated 40-50 meters of the leader, yet the determination on his face is that of an Olympic sprinter staring at gold. After two, he is behind 60 meters, still showing the eye of the tiger. After three, he has fallen behind by an incredible 70 some meters, in the middle of the pack, yet he is running a different race. You see, to this athlete, there was no one behind him or in front of him. There was only three numbers written in red ink on his left hand. He crosses the finish line, looks down at the inside of his left hand at his personal records and lets out the most emphatic fist clenching, 'YES!' that you could imagine from a shaggy haired pint sized seventh grader.   He had just set his personal record. He didn't finish 8th in a field of 21, he finished 1st against his own best self. The purest form of competition.",

I hope I can be half the man that he is one day.  My Dad... please read...  'People are often unreasonable, illogical, and self centred;  Forgive them anyway.    If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish ulterior motives;  Be kind anyway.    If you are successful, you will win false friends, and some true enemies;  Succeed anyway.    If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you;  Be honest and frank anyway.   What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight;  Build anyway.    If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous;  Be happy anyway.    The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow;  Do good anyway.    Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough;  Give the world the best you've got anyway.    You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and God;  It was never between them and you anyway.'  I recently had to make one of the hardest, if not the hardest decision I have ever made in my entire (be it short) life.  This passage has really helped and I have read it many times...  I have always struggled with one thing, and that is to please everyone.  Reality is you can’t, and it’s extremely tiring to try...  Through the tough, hard decisions you make in life, you learn who your true friends and family are.  The above passage mentions that it is between you and God... If you don’t believe in God, then this could be replaced with family, loved ones...  Always put your best foot forward, and once you’re committed, take action.  My parents came to Canada with 1,000 dollars.  With that they have raised 3 kids, one of them myself.  Though my father might have left everything in Chile, he came here so I could have a better life.  I will always be greatfull for that.  He might have left his degrees, training, everything in Chile, and though he might think he has not accomplished what he might have been able to,  I think he accomplished more than he will ever know.  Through Martial Arts, Day Care, he has talked to hundreds if not thousands of students, children, and has impacted all of there lives drastically.  All you need is have one conversation with my father and you will know what I mean.  Though he might not be doing what he studied to do, and engineer, through the lives he has touched he has honestly made this world a way better place to live for everyone.  The people he has talked to will make a difference, and if one child that might have been hanging out with his friends, and gotten involved with drugs and gangs, murderder someone, ends up going to school instead because my dad taught him or her Karate for free for years (with an occasional lecture for 3 hours after class) and gave them something to do while there parents were at a bar with friends, he has done more than I will ever do.

We had a couple games against eachother and let me tell you it got pretty competitive. The teams were co-ed. After we had one game where it was boys against girls it was cool but us girls were outnumbered. There were much more boys than girls. We played well though and scored a couple of points. Later on we had dinner (pizza) and there was a championship game. David which was one of the guys playing ended up getting his eyelid slid open due to contact with the stick. We were all worried in the beginning but everyone was quick to respond and care for him. We ended the night with announcements of MVP and a prayer. I cant wait until the next game.   SUNDAY  I went to church as usual 10am. The message was great it was on commitment to church. The college pastor spoke about his plans in building leadership and ministry. It was great. After college meeting we went to main service(11am-1P) and the pastor talked about the different struggles we face and how to face them. Truthfully that is something I needed to hear because it is what I am currently facing with. Keep me in prayer. After service there was a leadership meeting(1p-2p)that I got invited to. The college pastor led the meeting and he was talking about what has been steering in his and his wifes heart and how they are working to promote and provide opportunities for people to grow as leaders and for those that are leaders to proceed into extending that leadership in ministry. I have truly been praying about this so it was awesome to be a part of the meeting. I am hopeful and joyful to see how God is going to use me but I also am learning that it is not a waiting game completely...When God puts something in ours hearts we have to act and be proactive and he will bless us and provide us with the grace necessary. Finally, I went home and took a nap because I was tired. Not over yet! Later on at 6pm I went to the vacation bible study closing ceremony. It was amazing to see how awesome the kids were worshiping and hearing their testimonies. I pray God continue blessing those kids that received christ and also that He may empower them to continue having the desire to seek after him and bless those around them. Finally some of the people in my life group went to another's life group's event (The Atwaters house). They had ice cream sundaes for everyone. We just hung out in the back yard and talked it was great. I was so tired by now (10P) I ended up going home. It was  long day but it was a day full of blessings...Thank you father.  MONDAY  Well today was the first day of ART CAMP. I got assigned to lead the younger group (grades range from 1st to 4th grade). I have 27 students to lead. They were all self-motivated and anxious.  Here is a brief of how the day went. Our first class was Drama which is taught by some guy named Chad it was great because the kids love him and he was able to get all the kids comfortable. Later on we had art class which is taught by Allison we listened to music and and drew our impression of it. That was a new experience for me. Then we had ceramics which is taught by Erin kids made different pinch pots. Some of them came out really nice. and in the end we had another art class which is taught by Krista they did water resistent/watercolor sea life drawings. I am excited to see how those are going to turn out.  The students leave art camp by 4p and then the staff had a meeting 4p-4:40p. My work day ended at 5:15p and my friend and I headed over to the school gym for our 5:30 aerobics class. We are going to be attending aerobics classes (they offer different ones each day) everyday for the entire 5 weeks. I am really looking foward to this. The workout was great. I am soo tired and sore. After Aerobics class I came home took a quick shower read a chapter for my life group book study and went to subway picked up dinner and headed over to my meeting. I am now here home taking a break. I have to pack for tomorrow and go to bed. I am really tired I am going to stop writing now. I just thank God for giving me such a productive day.

It turns out that this weblog had a third reason for being, which at the time was known only to the Fates.  I spent the first twenty-four years of my life not knowing my biological father.  The events surrounding my birth would make a perfect Thomas Hardy plot, and so for various, tragically avoidable reasons Duncan was not around when I was born.  Mum had told me about him since I was old enough to speak and listen, and while I grew up happy and content knowing that I had one father who loved me and provided for me, I knew that there was another father in another town, maybe another country, whose blood I shared. I often wondered what else I shared with him. Did we look alike? Behave alike? Did I have his smile, his laugh?  When I was eighteen my parents told me that, as an adult, I was legally able to search for Duncan and make contact. Mum knew his parents - my grandparents - lived in the same house as they had when she knew him. All I needed to do was walk up to their gate, but for the past seven years I couldn't bring myself to do it. What if Duncan didn't want to know me? What if he was married to a woman who didn't know his past? I thought about the meeting many times, running it over in my head, but I hesitated at the point of action. Who knows what kind of an incident I could have caused?  About two months ago the twenty-four years of silence were broken. On the last day of our holiday in Florida I checked my email. Among the usual offers of free money from Nigerian businessmen, Vicodin, weight loss and penis gain tablets, was an email from a girl called Cate Graham with the subject 'Half Brother?'  A couple of stiff drinks later I replied to her email. The things she knew about me were correct. Out of nowhere I had a half-sister. I hoped it wasn't a cruel hoax or a practical joke. The next day, back at our apartment in Rochester, I hooked up the laptop and checked my email again. Another email from Cate. If I was happy to correspond with her, would I mind if my other sisters wrote too?  Other sisters?  Yes, there are two, Sinead and Rhianon.  Cate, do your parents know you've been in touch?  Yes.   A couple of days later, the expected email from Duncan arrived. A few days after that the subject of meeting up was broached. On June 3rd I stepped off a plane at Heathrow terminal 4 into the arms of my lost-and-found family. It's been a very strange, exciting and fulfilling few weeks. I was an only child from a small family. Now I have an extra father, a kind-of-stepmother, three half-sisters, a set of grandparents and a host of aunts, uncles and cousins, all of whom I'm sure will be mentioned here eventually. And, in a certain mood, under the right light, my biological father and I  do  have the same smile.  So, how did Duncan eventually find me? After years of calling various organisations, searching through records, asking friends of friends who lived in the town where I was born, and checking  Friends Reunited  and making no progress the solution was deceptively simple: on a whim he googled my name and found this site. OK, so there aren't millions of Liam Creightons, but there are quite a few. Try this: go to Google, type my name into the little box and click on 'I'm Feeling Lucky.' You'll get this website. The only reason that happens is because more people have read this page than any other that contain the words 'Liam Creighton'.  So, who is to thank for this happy ending? Lots of people, but right now I want to thank everyone who's ever looked at this silly little website. Those hits made everything easier. Hurrah for the internet. Hurrah for blogging. Hurrah for my conviction that what I write is worth reading. And hurrah to you for reading it!  Cheers.",

I couldn't go back to sleep, so I made a pot of freshly ground Starbucks coffee and headed to the gym. Today is shoulders and legs day, which I really enjoy, but my workout wasn't quite the same without the cardio. I have to rest my ankle for a few days, or until the swelling goes down. When I was done it was 7:30 a.m. which is perfect time for Turkish coffee at grandma's (teta is what I call her in Lebanese).  Teta is in her late seventies, but we manage to talk about politics, fashion, love, health, life, and the strange thing is that we both understand each other as though we are the same age. I hear all about her physical ailments. She covers everything from the arthritis in her left wrist to high blood pressure and cholesterol. 'The human body is like a machine', she tells me 'you have to keep oiling it or else it rusts'. I try to remember to oil it. I tell her about my Bikram yoga classes and she always encourages and praises me for pushing myself and trying new things.  Today was a different day though. I was on a mission when I went to Teta's. For years now, every time I visit, she tells me that she's getting old and can't keep up with all the house work, even though the house is spotless. There's a cleaning lady that comes next door every Friday, and I was on a mission to talk her into coming to clean on Fridays and to convince my grandpa (Jeddo) to accept and bust out with the checkbook (which would be the harder mission). I drank as much coffee as I could and went for it…and got her to come next Friday at eleven and got grandpa to agree to it!   Teta is very excited about the arrangement, but I made her promise that she can't get picky about the cleaning and to just be glad that someone is helping out. She promised.

        "blog_text": "Chavez and me   The upcoming referendum on the rule of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela presents an interesting quandry for the progressive/liberal community in the United States, as  this post  from MyDD seems to show.  I was disgusted when I saw it at first -- the final thought, 'A victory for Chavez is a defeat for Bush,' particularly upset me.  The implication is that, as a card carrying member of the Anybody But Bush crowd, a good progressive should support the Chavez government in its attempts to win the election.  I'm not going to go into the whole history of the recall effort, or  Venezuelan history  for that matter, but clearly Venezuela is now a country so polarized that it makes the Bush/ABB divisions seem like a polite disagreement.    Of course, the term 'recall' immediately brings to mind California and the Gropernator.  Add to that the Bush administration's (I'd say half-hearted) support of a 2002 businessman's coup that briefly overthrew the democratically elected Chavez, and progressive sympathies seem certainly warranted.  However, Hugo Chavez is not a man worthy of anyone's sympathies.  He finds himself in a difficult situation, his political life, and perhaps life in general, possibly nearing an end, but it is a situation that he has brought entirely upon himself.  By relying so much on the masses of poor Venezuelans to maintain his tenous claim to legitimacy, he is injecting into the population critically high amounts of the poisoinous rhetoric of class warfare, which Latin America has seen for too many decades now, darkening the horizons of his country's once bright future.    If you have seen Michael Moore's Farhenheight 9/11 you probably remember the opening scenes, those which centered on then Vice President Al Gore, in his role as President of the Senate, certifying the dubious electoral results that left him jobless (the first of many) and GWB the leader of a then free world.  The audience is meant to think, 'The horror!  How could this be!  How could he do this!  He's ignoring the well-voiced opposition of the Congressional Black Caucus, who actually want to help him!'  That scene, however, has for me a much more powerful message: despite extreme duress under which US democracy found itself, it held strong.  The defeated candidate remained defeated, even when he certainly could've manipulated the democratic 'rules of the game' to his benefit, to at least drag out the certification of the election and certainly to delegitimize his victorious opponent.  For that, we are all better off -- the world's most influential democracy continued to function, and despite the destruction that Bush has caused, the higher ideals of the American Republic have remained, allowing us, this November, to see to it that our voices are heard and the country continues to move forward.  This is not the case in Venezuela.  Chavez will do anything he can to manipulate the courts, the congress, and the electorate, to further his 'Bolivarian Revolution' -- a nice name given to a process which has resulted in the disenfranchisement of a huge portion of the population.  My heart is a revolutionary heart, I think, and a term like that, combined with rhetoric about giving the poor access to food, jobs, healthcare, any kind of better life, certainly stirs me.  In fact, when Chavez won the election in 1999, and then when he won the ensuing battle with the old congress, I was truly hopeful.  But all he has brought to Venezuela is renewed class warfare, economic stagnation (the surging demand for oil, of which Venezuela is the US's third largest supplier, has mitigated it, at least statistically, a bit), and, above all, a very, very uncertain future.  I think that the opposition to Chavez, a confusing, multifaceted blob of everything from corrupt oilmen to truly inspiring and principaled young leaders, has done a bad job at showing why they're the right choice for Venezuela.  I don't want to endorse their cause by any means -- I'm not Venezuelan, I've never been there, and what I hear in New York is so filtered and processed I don't think I can base any real opinions on it.  However, I can say, please don't tell me a vote for Chavez is a vote against Bush.  Chavez may spew vitriol against Bush, but he probably will against Kerry too.  He's throwing democracy out the window in favor of his one-party dictatorship-in-the-making.  He encourages violence and suppresses independent thought.  If he defeats the recall, he might just break the back of democracy in the country he professes to love so much.",

        "blog_text": "The first six weeks of first semester is for taking notes on cards for our big ol' research paper in English. The topic is three colleges that will help you get to your chosen career. At first I didn't know what I wanted to do at all so I just picked something cool, 'Recording Engineering'  I found the most awesome college in East Bay so I was getting all excited about that and the thought of being a recording engineer is cool but I just don't think I'm cut out for it, and I have to admit it.  But I was going along with it because the colleges for it are specific for it and are easy to get the information from. Especially the one I was researching in East Bay.  But then in Computer Programming class we had to make up a business and I totally forgot about my career idea that I had for a few days during the Summer before my dad shot my dreams up saying that it was risky business so I just forgot about it.  But I've been thinking about it more and more and I just think I would be the happiest person I could be if I could do this.  All I want is to own a small indie record/music store somewhere in an underground part of a city like Washington DC, somewhere in CA maybe, somewhere.   I was thinking about it and I think maybe DC is best, depending on where I go to college I think though.  So after much debating I decided to risk switching topics half way through the six weeks.  It's harder because these aren't little specialty schools, but it's worth it because this is what I am for sure going to do so I might as well get ready for it now.   So the colleges I'm doing are Longwood, VCU, and Berkeley.  Longwood is there for a nice local college that I know for sure I could get into.  VCU is probably my best bet. I'll probably end up picking that one. Because they talk about 'Small Business Ownership' alot in their course description which is EXACTLY what I want.  Berkeley is there because I like the location. And I'd go there for two years then hopefully get into the Haas Business School.  So I'm hoping to major in Business Administration.  The only problem with all this is you know, with business you need all that team work and leadership crap.  Man that's my biggest downfall.  But I really want this.   I imagine this little store, that all these subculture kids come in and they find their music and it's a friendly nice happy atomosphere. Just full of the air of music. Not the sound of music, but the feel of CDs and albums and records. Maybe you dont' feel that but I do anytime I'm in the music section of any store. I could live in a music store. I can spend hours just browsing, not even buying anything or seeing anything I want, just being there is enough for me. I think I would like to live back behind my store in a little dim room with a bed in the corner, and a little microwave and refridgerator in the corner.   I get all tense and anxious and excited just thinking about my little store.  Oh you don't know the kind of happiness it would give me if it could be exactly like that.",

Mylapore, on the other hand, has large Iyer community ( Saivities) also due to the famous Kapaleeshwarar temple situated here. Iyers and Iynegars are at logger heads in most of the issues but one common thread ( other than the sacred cross belt) that unites these communities is that they are TAMBRAMS( an acronym coined for Tamil Brahmins). \nTAMBRAMS are quite unique in their thinking. TAMBRAM kids are raised with an amazing singlemindedness which would put the Al Qaeda terrorists to shame. The first words that a TAMBRAM boy hears as soon as he is out of his mother's womb is his father commenting ' My Son will go to IIT'. Every TAMBRAM irrespective of his grey matter, is born to become a Engineer, be a successful Engineer and breed a few engineers. I wouldn't be surprised if the American Governemnt changes their immigration laws for the TAMBRAMS just like they did for the Hispanics due to the contribution of the TAMBRAM community to the silicon valley. \nAsk a TAMBRAM schoolgoing kid, his favourite subject.If he says anything other than Mathematics ( Kanakku, as his grandparents would have called it), then it means that in 20 years he will be a social outlaw. Mathematics and Math Tables are fed to him along with his baby foods which includes a daily diet of ladies finger( which exponential increases the retention capacity and makes a TAMBRAM remeber every formula deduced in the time from Pythogoras to Ramanujam). His lullabies go something like this '(a+b) = a2 + 2ab + b2, (a-b) = a2 -2ab + b2' sung in a lyrical fashion. A 'CENTUM' in Maths is very important for his parents. A 98 or 99 in the subject even in a monthly test will put them to great shame in a community which soley measures the intelligence of a kid by his marks in Mathematics. Anything less than a centum would push his family into great depression and I have even heard of cases when the parents have put their children to concentration camp like rules so that he bridges the gap with the rest of the students. \nThe worst time in the life of a TAMBRAM is during his transition from high school to College. The Entrance Exam really takes a toll on him. He would be made to write exams in every nook and corner of this vast country so that he is not left alone and will surely join the herd of engineers produced by his community. Any credit to securing an Engineering admit will go to his parents and all the blame( if he fails to secure an admission) would be directed at the kid, who burnt the midnight oil studying for these exams. Even in Engineering, if he gets into any department other than Computer Science or Electronics, his parents would be considered unfortunate. Chemical Engineering, Production Engineering etc are considered equivalent to nothing more than a 12th Standard pass and his neighbors who end up playing a major role in his life would constantly advise his parents about putting him into NIIT or APTECH so that he works close to software, code and TAMBRAMS ought be the modern day equivalent of Karna and his armor. \nAfter Engineering, the next stop in the TAMBRAM railway has to be a Masters in The United States. San Jose, CA is the dream destination of almost every TAMBRAM older generation. If it is not San Jose, it has to be Seattle or one of the Intel facilities.  The application process to the land of fruits and honey evokes a lot of animated conversations. Typically, our next house thatha( old man) would say ' Apply in Stanford, my son lives in Ohio( pronounced o-eee-o) and he will come to pick you up from the Airport'. For a TAMBRAM who is not well versed with geography and is a faithful follower of elder's words, this would seem like a really good idea. Little would he know that, Stanford and Ohio are thrice as far apart as Delhi and Chennai. \nWhen a TAMBRAM lands in the United States after much hype and hoopla, he will start missing the single best thing that he liked about home - Mom's home made recipes. Idli with Sambar, Dosa with Millaga Podi( Crounded Chilli Powder mixed with Oil), Curd Rice with Mango Pickle, Adhirasam, Appam, ( traditional TAMBRAM sweets). Not able to get anything close to these, he settles for the next best thing which are Hamburgers with French Fries, Tortillas with Chips, Fried Rice with Lemon Grass Chicken, Brownies and Bagles. For a TAMBRAM family, a boy in the United States is a point of great pride. He is considered to be a few rungs higher in the social ladder than his cousin who might be finishing up his Masters in Economics writing up a good dissertation on ' Poverty and its Effects in India'. An Ecomincs Student is nothing but a COMIC NOSE in the family, a guy who had to settle for something as lowly rated as Economics. \nAwait more in the journey of a TAMBRAM",

        "blog_text": "So many articles have been written on the subject, yet this piece by anarchie bunker makes it easy for us to understand the US invasion of Iraq. Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq? A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction. Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction. A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them. Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq? A: Yep. Invasions always work better than inspections. Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons of mass destruction, did we? A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election. Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass destruction? A: To use them in a war, silly. Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we went to war with them? A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had those weapons, so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves. Q: That doesn't make sense. Why would they choose to die if they had all those big weapons with which they could have fought back? A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make sense. Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did. A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway. Q: And what was that? A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country. Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country? A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people. Q: Kind of like what they do in China? A: Don’t go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer. Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate gain, it’s a good country, even if that country tortures people? A: Right. Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured? A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured. Q: Isn’t that exactly what happens in China? A: I told you, China is different. Q: What’s the difference between China and Iraq? A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba’ath party, while China is Communist. Q: Didn’t you once tell me Communists were bad? A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad. Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad? A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured. Q: Like in Iraq? A: Exactly. Q: And like in China, too? A: I told you, China’s a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not. Q: How come Cuba isn’t a good economic competitor? A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us. Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba, and started doing business with them, wouldn’t that help the Cubans become capitalists? A: Don’t be a smart-ass. Q: I didn’t think I was being one. A: Well, anyway, they also don’t have freedom of religion in Cuba. Q: Kind of like China and the Falun Gong movement? A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway, Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he’s not really a legitimate leader anyway. Q: What’s a military coup? A: That’s when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States. Q: Didn’t the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup? A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend. Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate? A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate. Q: Didn’t you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader? A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan. Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan? A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th. Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th? A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men – fifteen of them Saudi Arabians – hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings in New York and Washington, killing 3,000 innocent people. Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that? A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban. Q: Aren’t the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people’s heads and hands? A: Yes, that’s exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people’s heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too. Q: Didn’t the Bush administration give the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001? A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs. Q: Fighting drugs? A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies. Q: How did they do such a good job? A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off. Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people’s heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people’s heads and hands off for other reasons? A: Yes. It’s OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people’s hands for growing flowers, but it’s cruel if they cut off people’s hands for stealing bread. Q: Don’t they also cut off people’s hands and heads in Saudi Arabia? A: That’s different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply. Q: Don’t Saudi women have to wear burqas in public, too? A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body covering. Q: What’s the difference? A: The traditional Islamic covering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman’s body except for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman’s body except for her eyes and fingers. Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different name. A: Now, don’t go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends. Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia. A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan. Q: Who trained them? A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden. Q: Was he from Afghanistan? A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man. Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once. A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s. Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire Ronald Reagan talked about? A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or thereabouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now. Q: So the Soviets – I mean, the Russians – are now our friends? A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, but then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we’re mad at them now. We’re also mad at the French and the Germans because they didn’t help us invade Iraq either. Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too? A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast. Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn’t do what we want them to do? A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we invade. Q: But wasn’t Iraq one of our friends back in the 1980s? A: Well, yeah. For a while. Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then? A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily. Q: Why did that make him our friend? A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy. Q: Isn’t that when he gassed the Kurds? A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend. Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend? A: Most of the time, yes. Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy? A: Sometimes that’s true, too. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all the better. Q: Why? A: Because war is good for the economy, which means war is good for America. Also, since God is on America’s side, anyone who opposes war is a godless unAmerican Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq? Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to, right? A: Yes. Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq? A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do. Q: So basically, what you’re saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head? A: Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night. Q: Good night, Daddy.",

        "blog_text": "Any doctor will tell you that an alarming number of pregnancies end in first trimester miscarriage.  It makes sense if you think about all the things that have to come together perfectly to form that little tiny life inside of a woman.  It's truly a miracle that it ever works at all.  When it doesn't, though, all of the knowledge and statistics in the world mean nothing.  I remember the day that I miscarried my first child as if it were yesterday.  I remember the grey sky, the drizzling rain, the smell of the air, the song on the car radio as my husband, James,  drove us home from the hospital.    It was October 5, 1997.  We had been married for three and a half months when I found out I was 6 weeks and 2 days pregnant.  We weren't ready for a baby yet, but the general consensus in the family was that you can never be ready for a baby, and that we would be just fine.   Exactly six days after I found out, I came home from work to find that I was spotting.  I called my mother who  at that time lived in a different state.  I called everyone I knew for some sort of reassurance that it didn't mean anything and that my baby was okay.  As I began to feel cramps, I knew it wasn't okay.  I think I had known from the first spot of blood that there wouldn't be  a baby to hold in eight months.  That night was a sleepless one.  My husband tried to comfort me, telling me 'Don't worry, my son is going to be okay.' Eventually the cramps became fairly painful, and the bleeding had worsened.   James took me to the emergency room.  I remember shivering in the hospital gown as the doctor on duty checked me out.  He wouldn't give me any definitive answers.  He said though my cervix was partially open, I may still be sustaining a pregnancy and recommended I go to my OB/GYN the next day for an ultrasound.  We arrived at the office early the next morning, and watching pregnant patients and new mothers enter an exit the office building just about killed me.  My doctor performed an ultrasound, and could not find a gestational sac.  Those moments were a blur for me, and all I can remember is how he spouted out statistics and said, 'You're young... you can keep trying, you may even have another miscarriage.  Once you've had three, then we'll start testing you to see if there's a problem.'  He was cold and short and I don't think I have ever hated another human being the way I hated that doctor at that moment.  The attending nurse hugged me tightly, and she was the first of many who would seem to come out of the woodwork with miscarriage stories.  She told me how her first ended much the same way and that sometimes when you are young, the first time your body just doesn't know what to do and  there's nothing you can do about it.  I felt helpless and damaged.  As someone who doesn't accept failure easily, I felt as though the loss of human life that I had carried for 7 short weeks and only known about for one was completely my fault.  Surely I had done something wrong.  I didn't drink enough orange juice... I shouldn't have continued to do my nightly light work out once I found out I was pregnant....  I had doomed the life inside of me by thinking that I wasn't ready yet... I could think of a million reasons why I was to blame.  James dropped me off at the house that day, where my friend Karen was waiting to keep me company.  She hugged me and pointed to the table where she had set up Monopoly.  She was about seven months pregnant herself, and though it pained me to think of her child-bearing success I was happy to have her with me.  I was upset that my husband was still required to go to work after such an event.  I knew that life had to go on and that the pain would lessen, but I longed to have him with me .  I thought to myself that he was probably happy to go to work so that he wouldn't have to be with a blubbering basketcase all day.  It was apparent that he didn't know what to say to me.  It wasn't apparent how he felt about the miscarriage until he walked through the door twenty minutes after he had left me with Karen.  He was with Rhonda, his twin sister, whom he works for.  She told me that he had walked into the office and said, 'We lost the baby.', then burst into tears.  She cried right along with him and they both decided they needed to be with me.    After a while, the unexpected boughts of sadness subsided, and were eventually replaced with an irrational obsession with figuring out why it had happened.  Several women, aquaintances, friends and co-workers, had miscarriage stories to tell.  It is almost as if there is this club of women who have dealt with the loss of a pregnancy, but you don't even know about it until you confide in them that you have lost one of your own.  I was surprised that women with several children had experienced one or two miscarriages.  Some had trouble conceiving or had even lost a child in the second or third trimester.  I began to surf the internet for answers on early term miscarriages in perfectly healthy women with no family history of infertility or child bearing complications.  In chat rooms, I found women talking about progesterone levels.  The more research I did, the more I began to realize that doctors are not gods or miracle workers, and it was the first time in my life that I realized that I had to take charge of my own health care issues.    When I found out I was pregnant, it was confirmed in the doctors office with a urine test after I had taken a home test that showed a very slight positive a few days earlier.  I remember telling the doctor that I didn't feel pregnant.  They drew blood that day for the standard tests, and it wasn't until this past year that I would know the results of that test and how they could have changed my life.   In all my research, I learned that progesterone is the hormone needed to keep the uterus a friendly environment to a growing embryo or fetus.  It spikes each month in fertile days or throughout pregnancy and drops dramatically in the days before delivery.  The lessening of progesterone levels in a woman's system prompts the uterus to contract and expel either the monthly lining that has built up or the full-term baby in the form of labor.  If a woman's progesterone level at conception is not optimum, it is most likely that a miscarriage will occur unless she uses a progesterone supplement in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy.  Some of the symptoms of low progesterone levels included longer monthly cycles or irregularity and absence of normal pregnancy symptoms, and difficulty conceiving.  The more I read about low progesterone, the more I knew that this was my complication.  I was still very young and had not thought to consult my doctor about my findings and inquire about the results of the blood test I had taken.  On July 23, 1998, I found out I was pregnant again.  Gripped with fear but armed with information, when the doctor's office confirmed the pregnancy, I asked to have a blood test immediatly and requested progesterone supplements.  My doctor seemed a little surprised by my request but seemed to humor me in light of my earlier miscarriage.  A week or so later his nurse called to tell me that my original progesterone levels were in fact 'a little low', so I should continue the supplements and was to come in for an ultrasound just to confirm that everything was okay.  Even though I knew in my heart that this time would be different, I still had nightmares before that ultrasound that I would once again be presented with some sort of horrible news.  Instead, it was the ultimate best thing I have ever seen on a television - the healthy beating heart of my son.  At 7 weeks and two days gestation, his first picture resembled a peanut.  It had taken us ten months to conceive after my miscarriage.  the longer it took, the more I was convinced of the progesterone problem.  My thoughts were confirmed by that blood test,  but I shudder to think that if I had not taken the initiative to know about progesterone and its role in a pregnancy, I might have lost my son as well.  4 years later, in June of 2002, I received the good news once again.  And once again, I requested bloodwork and supplements.  Due to insurance issues, I had to change my OB/GYN provider during this pregnancy.  I was about three months pregnant when I received records from my original OB/GYN to transfer to the new office.  I came home with that folder and rifled through it like a madwoman.  My husband asked me what I was doing and made some comment about not knowing what anything in there meant and that you can't read doctors' handwriting anyway.   But I found it.  Three pieces of paper that didn't change anything but made a world of difference.  They were blood test results, and all of them had a column clearly marked 'progesterone'.  The one from 1997 was at 6.5.  6.5 what, I don't know.  But that was extremely low considering the test from July of 1998 was at 10.2 and the June 2003 one at 14.  On my next appointment, I asked the nurse midwife who would later deliver my daughter what the normal progesterone level should be.  She said something to the effect that they would treat anything under 12 at about 7 or 8 weeks of pregnancy.    Though nothing will bring the lost baby back, I know that that child existed for a reason.  That reason was for me to take control of my health and fertility and for me to pass on what I have learned about to other women who have gone through the same thing.  When you've lost a child early in pregnancy, people have a way of trying to comfort you by minimizing the loss.  They say you're young and have plenty of time to fill your house with children.  They say it happened for a reason, that the baby was imperfect in some genetic way and you're better off if it wasn't going to be  a healthy child.  Some believe that it is the loss of a pregnancy, not a  human life.  Whatever it is to you, you have to deal with it in your own way.  The perfectionist in me drove me to find the fault and correct it, and I thank God every day that I was able to do so.  For many women, the problem isn't so easy to solve.  It is discomforting to know, though, that many women have lost children to similar problems that could easily be prevented.  When I think back on the events of my miscarriage, I don't place blame anymore, but I often wonder if my child would not have been lost had my doctor listened to me a little more closely or raised an eyebrow at my slightly positive home test result. I look at my beautiful children every day and marvel at the miracle that they are.  Sometimes I wonder what my lost baby would've looked like, or I replay the event of my miscarriage in my mind.  If you've had a miscarriage, you know what I mean.  I don't dwell on the loss, but it is always with me.  I've joined the club.  Every once in a while, a friend or acquaintance will relay news of a miscarriage.  I feel their pain, and for  a moment, I feel mine all over again.  Then I tell my story so they can know that they are not alone, and that there is a future to hope for.",

        "blog_text": "Further Meditation on Vipassana \n\nEven after 10 days of meditating in monk-like seclusion, I still have doubts about Vipassana.  Doubts about its philosophy, its metaphysics, its 'secular' theology.  But not doubts about the technique itself and its practical benefits.  Vipassana claims to be a secular meditation technique, but during the 10 days we were bombarded with Buddhist philosophy/metaphysics/theology from all angles.  Everything is Buddha this, dhamma that.  Not that I have a problem with it, out of all the major religions I do find Buddhism to be the least indoctrinating and most user-friendly.  However, at times Goenka's video lectures do have the feel of a sermon and I am allergic to that kind of religious innuendo.  The basic assumptions that Vipassana makes are rational enough.  The source of all suffering is craving/aversion.  Craving/aversion arises from sankara, which I understood as emotional reactions against physical sensations.  As sensation arises, one quite naturally develops a +/- preference for it.  During meditation, as long as you observe your sensations with supreme objectivity and equanimity--i.e. no +/- preference--you will not generate sankaras and you will there have averted craving/aversion and thus in turn misery.  Since the nature of everything is impermanence, it is only rational to treat everything with objectivity and equanimity without attaching to something so transient and ephemeral.  In this way, I suppose meditation is used as a practical metaphor for life. \n\nWhat about carvings/aversions that have non-physical/symbolic abstractions as their objects?  What if what you crave is merely an idea?  I suppose it is easy to point out that any mental activity has physical/biochemical/neural manifestations, which, in principle can be 'felt' and the same technique can aid in the elimination of its corresponding craving/aversions.  There is logical contradiction in this: if as I understood previously, by maintaining that one can separate physical sensation from its mental treatment (separating pain sensation from pain experience), then it is essentially stating that the link of mind and body must be broken in order to transcend misery; yet, to eliminate craving/aversion for mental objects, one must resort to the very link (mental object as physical manifestations) that he tries to break.  This is asking for the impossible, it doesn't make sense to use the same sword to cut itself in half.  Furthermore, even if somehow this logical contradiction can be avoided, the technique can merely eliminate the resonance of craving/aversion (mental object resulting in physical manifestation, which is felt and further crv/avs avoided) but not the source, which is necessarily mental and does not stem from bodily sensations.  Additionally, I don't feel that craving/aversion is necessarily evil.  Sure they cause misery, but they are also fundamental elements that drive evolution and progress.  A lion craves meat (not in the emotional sense, but in a more philosophical sense that since meat will extend its existence and it naturally gravitates toward an 'evolutionary' craving).  The nature of life is such that it craves its continuation, life's object of craving is life itself.  But then I suppose this is precisely the battle Buddha is trying to fight.  The law of nature is cyclical suffering and struggle to further itself, and Buddha is trying to break man out of that cycle.  To shatter our craving for our own life?  Regardless, there's no doubt meditation will benefit me in ways other than guiding me on a labyrinthine path to enlightenment.  Studies have shown that it increases mental focus and awareness, reduces stress and lethargy.  I can already feel that I've been having more dreamful sleep, more lucid dreams, and less sleep.  I crave these physical manifestations of my slightly cleansed mind so much that I will continue to meditate and discover about Vipassana and Buddhism.  Until the day I realize that I can break the circle, I will continue to use this craving for meditation and its benefits to fuel my meditative elimination of craving.",

I didn't really do much at the library yesterday, just made a few notes regarding the wave-particle duality, the whole de Broglie's relationship stuff, read a few books regarding religion and philosophy. Actually, looking back, I should have spent my whole evening there, but really, the mood wasn't there, last week was better though.  But I feel good, almost like the library has become my new 'church', lol. I used to go to church on weekends but now its off to the library. No more church for me, I've quitted, tada, in case you did not know. I feel liberated really, liberated in my mind.

Anyway, back to that topic, about controlling my mind, exactly, well, I make my own informed decisions about my beliefs, I do not only seek scientific perspectives but also religious ones as well. I just took a test though, and they said my beliefs are more suited for neo-paganism. Y'noe what? I hate being part of something big, to be part of some spiritual xerox machine, or some spiritual factory, where spiritually 'strong' people are manufactured. Its like I'm a soldier ushered into some rank and file, being told what to think what to do.  God encouraged individuality, he encourages personal style of worship, and revelation, stuff like that. God reveals himself not only in religion, but also in science, in art, in nature. So, the church telling me that only THEY have the true revelation of God is repulsive. A christian bookshop should not only sell christian stuff but also beethoven, mozart, U2, Rush. Van Gogh stuff like that. Such stuff is from God, and they worship God, even if the artist did not mean it to be that way, but the beauty is testement of God.  So anyway, enough of my ranting about the pitfalls of organized religion. I just realized that religion provides this view of reality which is incomplete, and it requires science, art etc. to fill in the gaps which also they themselves are incomplete and need religion to fill in their gaps, so its more like an inter-dependent relationship.

        "blog_text": "For the past three years I have had the honor to serve as an Adjunct Professor of Political Science and History at LIU Southampton.  Having previously taught at American University, Rutgers University, Dowling College, Hofstra University, and having served as a federal prosecutor for many years, I feel that I am in a position to make an informed evaluation of the quality of the students and faculty at Southampton.   Over the three years,I have taught scores of dedicated and gifted students who not only eagerly sought to acquire knowledge but, more importantly, sought to apply that knowledge beyond the walls of the academic setting.  It has also been a sincere privilege to work with some of the finest faculty members that I have ever known  Based on my experiences, I felt compelled to respond to the Administration's abrupt and, in my mind, arbitrary decision to eliminate the undergraduate programs at Southampton.   First, I believe that the students, staff, and faculty of LIU should feel betrayed by the way in which the decision to close was reached and conveyed to the community.  For the past months, all of us, to varying degrees, at the specific direction of the Administration, were working on a new core curriculum designed to bring a new sense of vitality and academic excellence to the college.  Now, it appears clear that the countless hours of hard work, the innumerable meetings and discussions, the seeking of input from students and other academic institutions, was done at a time when the Board of Trustees and the Administration were obviously considering and, one might believe, preparing for the closure of the school.  A professor would be sanctioned were he or she to assign a major research project, demand the students work endless hours on that project, and then arbitrarily state that the course was cancelled and all the work was for naught.  And yet, is that not exactly what the Administration has done to each of us?   Second, the duplicity was exaggerated by the fact that, thanks to the generosity of certain donors and the entire community, a new Library is under construction and well on its way to completion.  What possible logic exists for the expenditure of millions of dollars in constructing a new Library while, at the same time, the future users of that facility are being shipped off to CW Post many miles away?  Were I am alumnae or donor who contributed to the building of that library, I would demand my money be returned--otherwise one suspects that they have contributed to a building that will be part of the new condominium or commercial development--enriching the coffers of LIU at the expense of those who loyally and faithfully contributed to the college.   third, if I were an Incoming Freshman, Sophomore or Junior at LIU Southampton, I would feel an ever greater sense of betrayal.  When one applies to and opts to attend a four year college, one expects that they will receive a four year education.  But each of you have essentially had the contract you signed with LIU Southampton unilaterally breached by the Administration.  In announcing the closing, the Administration congratulated themselves for giving the community a one year reprieve.  To that I say, thanks for nothing.  Consider the 'choices' that undergraduates face:  (1) incoming freshman can withdraw from their attendance but will find themselves well beyond the application and decision dates at other schools--so your choice is attending a school whose life span is one year or scrambling to try to salvage your first year of college; (2) sophomores will find themselves having paid full college tuition for what will become a two year/community college education in the sense that all of the riches of the upper division classes will be lost forever when the school closes; and (3) juniors will find themselves literally forced to make the switch to CA Post as I know of very few schools who will accept a transfer student to receive a degree when only thirty credits remain  to be completed.  And lest the graduate students believe that they have been 'saved,' let me suggest that a few hundred student graduate program will not long survive the logic and calculations of this Administration.   Fourth, the fact that the Administration has apparently been actively engaged in the sale of the campus property underscores all of the concerns expressed above.  While real estate is not my field, I can only imagine that the value of this campus property in Southampton is staggering, indeed.  And one only has to think about the controversy and dismay attending the debate over a potential casino, to recognize that a new commercial or residential development is the LAST thing that the Southampton community needs or deserves.  And yet, it would appear, with no input from the faculty, staff, students, alumnae, donors, community, and elected officials, the Administration has demonstrated amazing (and unique) efficiency in moving towards the potential sale of the property.     Fifth, beyond all the substantive concerns expressed above, in my many years of professional work, I have never seen such a poorly handled communications process.  Receiving letters in the mail days AFTER the public announcement of the closing does not reflect a caring and compassionate response to the concerns and needs of the community.  If the Administration is seriously concerned about the 'family,' then I would assume they will soon announce that a substantial part of the proceeds of the sale of the campus will be directed to the many staff at the school who, come May 2005, will find themselves unemployed.   What will happen to the secretaries, the custodial workers, the food service workers, the librarians, and others--does the Administration seriously expect them to make the move to CW Post (even if such positions were offered them).    In summary, I find myself with truly ambivalent feelings.  On the one hand I mourn for the potential destruction of a fine college and wonderful community of scholars.  On the other hand, I rejoice in the initiative and hard work demonstrated by many of you who are committed to saving the college.  Whether you ultimately succeed or not, I can promise you one thing--as the end of the day, you will feel far more pride and honor in your actions than those who took this action will feel.

Blissfully ignorant, they thank me and hang up. God, we let the people vote and drive, too?  8:12am  Accounting called to say they couldn't access expense reports database. Gave them Standard Sys Admin Answer #112, 'Well, it works for me.' Let them rant and rave while I unplugged my coffeemaker from the UPS and plugged their server back in. Suggested they try it again. One more happy customer...  8:14 am  User from 8:05 call said they received error message 'Error accessing Drive 0.' Told them it was an OS problem. Transferred them to microsupport.  11:00 am  Relatively quiet for last few hours. Decide to plug support phone back in so I can call my girlfriend. Says parents are coming into town this weekend. Put her on hold and transferred her to janitorial closet down in basement. What is she thinking? The 'Myst' and 'Doom' nationals are this weekend!  11:34 am  Another user calls (do they ever learn?). Says they want ACL changed on HR performance review database so that nobody but HR can access database. Tell them no problem. Hang up. Change ACL. Add  so performance reviews are sent to .  12:00 pm  Lunch  3:30 pm  Return from lunch.  3:55 pm  Wake up from nap. Bad dream makes me cranky. Bounce servers for no reason. Return to napping.  4:23 pm  Yet another user calls. Wants to know how to change fonts on form. Ask them what chip set they're using. Tell them to call back when they find out.  4:55 pm  Decide to run 'Create Save/Replication Conflicts' macro so next shift has something to do.  Tuesday  8:30 am  Finish reading support log from last night. Sounded busy. Terrible time with Save/Replication conflicts.  9:00 am  Support manager arrives. Wants to discuss my attitude. Click on .

Tell her I need employee number, department name, manager name, and marital status. Run  against state parole board database, Centers for Disease Control database, and my  database. No hits. Tell her ID will be ready tonight. Drawing from the lessons learned in last week's 'Reengineering for Customer Partnership,' I offer to personally deliver ID to her apartment.  10:07 am  Janitor stops by to say he keeps getting strange calls in basement. Offer to train him on . Begin now. Let him watch console while I grab a smoke.  1:00 pm  Return from smoking break. Janitor says phones kept ringing, so he transferred them to cafeteria lady. I like this guy.  1:05 pm  Big commotion! Support manager falls in hole left where I pulled floor tiles outside his office door. Stress to him importance of not running in computer room, even if I do yell 'Omigod -- Fire!'  1:15 pm  Development Standards Committee calls and complains about umlauts in form names. Apologizing for the inconvenience, I tell them I will fix it. Hang up and run global search/replace using .  1:20 pm  Mary  from cafeteria calls. Says she keeps getting calls for 'Notice Loads' or 'NoLoad Goats,' she's not sure, couldn't hear over industrial-grade blender. Tell her it was probably 'Lettuce Nodes.' Maybe the food distributor with a new product? She thinks about it and hangs up.  2:00 pm  Legal secretary calls and says she lost password. Ask her to check in her purse, floor of car, and on bathroom counter. Tell her it probably fell out of back of machine. Suggest she put duct tape over all the airvents she can find on the PC. Grudgingly offer to create new ID for her while she does that.  2:49 pm  Janitor comes back. Wants more lessons. I take off rest of day.  Wednesday  8:30 am  Irate user calls to say chipset has nothing to do with fonts on form. Tell them of course, they should have been checking 'Bitset,' not 'chipset.' Sheepish user apologizes and hangs up.  9:10am  Support manager, with foot in cast, returns to office. Schedules 10:00am meeting with me. User calls and wants to talk to support manager about terrible help at support desk. Tell them manager about to go into meeting. Sometimes life hands you material.....  10:00 am  Call  in janitorial services to cover for me. Go to support manager's office. He says he can't dismiss me but can suggest several lateral career moves. Most involve farm implements in third-world countries with moderate to heavy political turmoil.

Marvin doubts. I point to 'Corporate Policy' database (a fine piece of work, if I say so myself!). 'Remember, that's DOUBLE pepperoni and NO peppers!'

Catch Marvin scanning want ads.  5:00 pm  Shift change. Flick HR's server off and on several times (just testing the On/Off button...). See ya tomorrow.  Friday  8:00 am  Night shift still trying to replace power supply in HR server. Told them it worked fine before I left.  9:00 am  Marvin still not here.

Tell them to call Telecommunications.  9:30 am  Good God, another user! They're like ants. Says he's in San Diego and can't replicate with Des Moines. Tell him it's sunspots, but with a two-hour difference. Suggest he reset the time on the server back two hours.  10:17 am  Pensacola calls. Says they can't route mail to San Diego.

Man, I love modern technology!  2:30 pm  Look in support manager's contact management database. Cancel 2:45pm appointment for him. He really should be at home resting, you know.  2:39 pm  New user calls. Says want to learn how to create a connection document. Tell them to run connection document utility . Says PC rebooted. Tell them to call microsupport.  2:50 pm  Support manager calls to say mixup at doctor's office means appointment cancelled. Says he's just going to go on home.

But, to continue with the rhetorical device, lots of people asking for change.  And -- as opposed to the taxi drivers -- they're more aggressive than their counterparts in New York.  They try to make conversation, they stand in the middle of the sidewalk, they follow you, they plead, they make eye contact.  They're persistent.  It's kind of interesting, actually.  Because they don't seem dangerous, and there are lots of people around so it's not like it feels like a safety threat or anything, but it's just a little surprising that this is where they flourish.  In Cambridge, Massachusetts, right outside the Harvard University campus.  Just seems a little odd and cognitively dissonant to me.

Me: Okay, deal. Change Guy: Okay. Me: So how'd you end up on the street? Change Guy: Orgo. Me: Orgo? Change Guy: Yeah. Organic Chemistry.  I was a student at Harvard, class of '77.  Wanted to be a doctor.  Took organic chemistry.  Flunked it. Me: This was before grade inflation. Change Guy: Yeah.  So I flunked it and had to drop out.  And I needed some quick cash to start paying back the student loans. Me: Cause the late '70s and interest rates were so high. Change Guy: Yeah, exactly.  I mean, I voted for Carter, but those interest rates were totally not what I needed at that point. Me: Okay, so you flunked out and needed the cash.  Why begging? Change Guy: Couldn't get hired at the Gap. Me: Gotcha.  And you've been here ever since? Change Guy: Actually I tried New Haven for a couple of years but I kept getting mugged. Me: Understood.  So how much do you usually pull in a day? Change Guy: About three hundred bucks if I work a full eight hours. Me: Three hundred bucks?  That's incredible! Change Guy: Yeah, my wife thinks so too. Me: You're married? Change Guy: Yeah.  And we live just up Mt. Auburn Street.  My wife's a dental hygienist. Me: What? Then why are you still on the street? Change Guy: Well, like I just said, it's lucrative.  And it's creative.  You know, coming up with new ways to get people to give me money. It's kind of fun, it keeps me sharp.  Plus I get to be close to my son. Me: Your son? Change Guy: Yeah, he's a sophomore at Harvard.  Economics major.  He's real smart.  Stops by to say hi a couple of times a day, we usually have lunch together. Me: Where do you eat? Change Guy: Well usually he just brings me his leftovers from the dining hall.  Gotta save on the expenses here.  Every quarter counts.  Especially those state ones.  That's one of the big perks doing this actually.  I see the new state quarters usually the day they come out. I've got a whole book of 'em, I'm a collector. Me: Cool.  What do you notice most about Harvard students? Change Guy: The conversations I overhear.  Can always tell who's a Harvard student.  They're always throwing those 10-letter words into the conversation.  Words like 'privileged,' 'gentrified,' and 'epiglottis.'  Sometimes makes me sick.  Well, that or the smell coming from Au Bon Pain.  Not sure which. Me: One last question.  What's the future hold for you?  You want to be here in Harvard Square forever, or you have plans to move ahead? Change Guy: Well, I've enjoyed my time here.  I really have.  But actually this is my last semester in the Square.  I took the GMAT a couple of weeks ago and scored pretty well -- and I'm starting at the business school next fall.  Hopefully start up a technology company of some sort.  Make a 'change.'  Get it?  Change?  Cause I ask for change?  It's a pun. Me: Yeah, I got it.  Well it was nice talking to you.  Here's your two bucks.  Have a nice day. Change Guy: Thanks.

The Mexican explained that his small catch was sufficient to meet his needs and those of his family. The American asked,'But what do you do with the rest of your time?'

In the evenings, I go into the village to see my friends, have a few drinks, play the guitar, and sing a few songs...I have a full life.' The American interrupted,'I have an MBA from Harvard and I can help you! You should start by fishing longer every day. You can then sell the extra fish you catch. With the extra revenue, you can buy a bigger boat. With the extra money the larger boat will bring, you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers. Instead of selling your fish to a middle man, you can negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant. You can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City, Los Angeles, or even New York City! From there you can direct your huge enterprise.' 'How long would that take?' asked the Mexican.

        "blog_text": "I want to change the world. I do. I want to be a lot active in the way I live out my life so I crystalised my current mental state as the following...    Books and changing oneself or the world   (this might be a little messy - I may have suffered a paradigm shift between the beginning and end of writing)   I have probably read more recently than any other time in the last 5 years. That being said, I have often had a rather negative view of books (for various reasons).   Right now, I just have negative thoughts about books that try to change your life or change the world. Books could outline how to do something, but in the end I think that it usually just results in a lot of head-nodding and no action. Reading is usually too passive for me. I think that knowledge comes from books, but wisdom (I think there is a distinction) comes from learning as you act in every action of your life (this has become a tenet of my recent life).   It is fine to read 'Dance like no-one is watching' but to do this is actually a process that is done in action and developed, not just read and done. To dance like no-one is watching, you would need to address your self-confidence, your self-image, your self-consciousness, your dancing self-efficacy (a term from a social cognitive theory, meaning confidence in a particular skill, 'Can I pull it off?' feeling), and find the real purpose for why you dance (perhaps one of the most important). These are not resolved by reading. By actively widening each of these aspects in every action you do is what is most important. Only then can you 'Dance like no-one is watching'.  There are many self-help/new-age save the world books out there. Some have a vital heart but malformed limbs. The intention is there but they do nothing, change nothing. I am starting to have the perhaps not completely unfounded opinion that self-help books are literary drugs, making those who read feel good. Chicken Soup for the Soul is typical. Empty platitudes that inspire good feelings.   Probably my perception of all art affects my view of books and writing. I see the process as more beneficial to the writer than the reader. I love writing, and sometimes entertain ideas of publishing, but it would probably be more as a personal attempt to develop my ideas. So reading someone else's enlightenment should be secondary to breaking down your barriers to greater wisdom.  There have been some books in history that have changed the world. Right now I can only think of one person who by writing a book changed anything (for good or bad):   Karl Marx's 'Das Kapital'. His ideas changed the world (better or worse). But in his life he was an activist too and he did have a good advocate in Engels. He was attempting some sort of leadership too. Hitler wrote a book too 'Mein Kampf', but he backed that with very firm leadership (probably the greatest mover in his success). Most strong leaders don't necessarily leave books. I think most religions were only sustained by the actions of their figureheads and not the actual texts themselves.  A Chinese philosopher, Zhuang-zi, wrote a story to say how reading other people's thoughts might not get the 'real message'. \nDuke Huan was reading a book in the hall. Wheelwright Pian, who had been chiseling a wheel in the courtyard below, set down his tools and climbed the stairs to ask Duke Huan, 'may I ask what words are in the book Your Grace is reading?'  'The words of sages.' the Duke responded. 'Are these sages alive?' 'They are already dead.'  'That means you are reading the dregs of long gone men, doesn't it?'  Duke Huan said 'How does a wheelwright get to have opinions on the books I read? If you can explain yourself I'll let it pass otherwise, it's death!'   Wheelwright Pian said ''In my case I see things in terms of my own work. When I chisel at a wheel, if I go slow the chisel slides and does not stay put; if I hurry, it jams and doesn't move properly. When it is neither too slow nor too fast I can feel it in my hand and respond to it from my heart. My mouth cannot describe it in words but there is something there  I cannot teach it to my son and my son cannot learn it from me So I have gone on for seventy years, growing old chiseling wheels The men of old died in possession of what could not transmit. So it follows that what you are reading is their dregs.' \nI agree with this. Except a writer whom you have no contact with is as good as dead. Guidance from someone is essential. Zhuang-zi is dead so I guess these are the dregs of dead men. Zhuang-zi didn't write it, his followers did.  To make people move, you don't need a book passively giving them the ideas.   So if books don't change the world, what does the world need? You need a person to lead.  So if books don't change people, what do people need? You need a person to guide and aid reflection.  These of course are more difficult but rather more profound for me.  Leadership is a way to change the world. History proves it. Napoleon and Gandhi didn't write books. The former just needed to be in power and that seemed to make armies strong. The latter was too busy doing things like fasting and leading. I have been inspired by recent observations and an event (NZWA) for what I personally think leadership requires but that is another message. That still needs a bit more time for me to ruminate on the verbal cellulose in the paddocks of my brain.  Mentorship seems logical for a person to develop. It seems that in the rather individualistic society in which I live that dealing with our personal life planning our by ourselves to be foolish. Planning could always benefit from a different perspective. Would your physical training do better with a personal trainer / running buddy or by your own solitary efforts? Are you more likely to adhere to your plan and goals if you have had a witness who will remind you of those promises, or those made to yourself? It seems obvious. Why am I only discovering this now...?  Wouldn't the real benefit of a book come from reflection with someone, some planning and goal setting based on your conclusions? If you did read 'Dance like no-one was watching' and were inspired and thought that that was what you wanted to do, wouldn't it be better to think about it concretely and objectively?  The concept of being interactive with a book's text is mindblowing. Maybe the problem lies in my own mind that takes reading books was the purpose in itself.  Writing also suffers in that it is distant from those you are trying to move. Compare an e-mail, to a letter, a letter to a person encounter. What would move you heart, mind and body to act in a new way that someone advocated, would save the world? E-mail has words but sometimes seems to lack soul. Letters have soul but sometimes lack the face. In AIESEC, we were often told that when cold-calling we should not discuss things on the phone or elaborate too much. If we give them information on the phone, they could easily just say no and hang up. If there is a meeting, then it is harder to hang-up, and also you have a bond created in meeting the person.  To have a leader is to have someone with the message burst from their every word and action. You can see their vitality and passion and it brought people along. See old clips of Hitler, Martin Luther King Jr. and Churchill. Their demonstration and words changed history and changed people. Come to think of it, have all the compelling, strong orators gone, never to be seen again?  If a person has written a book that inspired you, and they are not leading a movement to actively go out and change anything, nothing may happen of it.   So, I think I need to re-evaluate my mode of constructing the process that define the course of my life and actions. I will do that this week.  Okay, that's all. Anyone who wants to offer any thoughts of what I am trying to express, tell me and we can have tea (on me). Later.",

        "blog_text": "Community Service Essay \nI present to you my community service essay, which I hastily threw together in 30 minutes.  It is a bunch of fluffed up crap.  Sometimes I tried to be funny because my teacher has corny humor--well not corny, just her own bizarre  humor--with the intention that I'd land some extra points.  Let me know what you think.  Megan Reuter Mrs. Walker Ethics (1) 4/28/04 \nWithout a sense of caring, there can be no sense of community -Anthony J. D'Angelo    \nIn order to build a sense of care and compassion in my community, I volunteered at O'Connor Hospital.  Every Saturday morning--when I would usually still be snoring--I put on my Candy Striper uniform and drove down the road to the hospital.  I must admit that in those lethargic morning hours, most of the time I did not want to be going to volunteer.  I would rather be at my ballet technique class or teaching toddlers the art of dance.  Instead, I willingly made a sacrifice to give back to all my community has given to me.  My way of giving back was working in an environment with people I do not normally associate with.    \nUpon arrival at the hospital, I slowly trekked my way through the sinuous hallways.  The hallways were always cold, with a slight smell of Neosporin.  Every time I hiked to my destination, thoughts inundated my mind such as, how could someone ill possibly recover in such a sullen environment or why don't they paint the walls a bright, healthy color?   These rhetorical questions were only designed to occupy my half-asleep brain until I arrived at the Mail Room.    \nOnly God knows why they named this room the Mail Room because there was no mail inside.  This was the lowly volunteer hub, an incommodious room, even more frigid than the hallways.  The room was dressed with cement walls and floors, a ghetto stereo that always played Hispanic music, and recycled office chairs for volunteers to sit in.  The only pleasant element of this room was that it had all the latest issues of InStyle, People, and Cosmopolitan magazines.      \nSo, the basic routine went like this: the phone rang, the adult employee answered it and wrote down the request, and the student volunteer carried out the assignment.  The only trouble came when there were three or more volunteers; for example, let's say their names were Megan, Hilda, and Rupert.  The adult volunteer would say he had an assignment to be carried out.  All three of the volunteers' eyes would rise from their magazines and look at one another, telepathically sending messages like, I already went, it's your turn or there's no way I'm getting up again.  One of them, let's say Megan, graciously accepts the task and performs it with compassion.    \nA volunteer could be given a myriad of tasks to execute.  The most common would be to deliver supplies to different wings of the hospital.  These supplies ranged in variety from surgical gowns to urine catheters, and would travel to different sections such as the Emergency Room or Labor and Delivery.  Those kind of jobs required superior knowledge of the hospital's layout, which came each week with trial and error.   Another example of a task that would be asked of a volunteer would be to take blood and urine samples to the lab for analysis.   These samples could be the difference between life and death for many patients, especially in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  If a volunteer was called to retrieve a sample from the ICU, he or she could not spend time dawdling, looking at the old lady volunteers' pictures on the wall that have been volunteering at the hospital for half a century, rather, he or she would have to speedily give the samples to the lab.  Quickness was important with these samples because most patients in the ICU are near death, and results are needed promptly.  It was nerve racking to me that I was holding a person's fate in my own hands, so I took the job seriously, only stopping to look at the pictures after I dropped off the sample.             \nThe last example of a task--a personal favorite of mine--would be discharging the patients downstairs and wheeling them outside to get in their cars and go home.  My favorite patients were the mothers and newborns because they looked so thrilled to be alive to celebrate their lives together; moreover, the babies were awfully cute.  They just looked so inspired by the world, full of new promises and hopes.              \nHowever, I did also enjoy discharging the elderly patients, except on one occasion.  This old Mexican lady must have weighed near 400 pounds because it was near impossible to get her into a wheelchair.  Her daughter was with her to take her home.  After a few attempts to get her comfortable in the wheelchair without further impairing her broken leg, we set off to go downstairs.  The antiquated wheelchair squealed across the linoleum of the lobby and rotated out the revolving door.  Trying to get her out of the wheelchair was the worst because the footrests did not return to their idle position.  Her daughter impatiently yelled at me, 'Don't you know what the hell you're doing?'  Even in the midst of frustration with the impossible equipment and the ignorant woman, I kept my cool.  Although, needless to say, it was one of the more unpleasant experiences I went through at the hospital.           \nIn conclusion, I think I would never work there again, but I do value the lessons I learned while I was there.  I learned to live up to my commitments, even though it would have been easier to quit; but most of all, I learned that patience really is a virtue.",

        "blog_text": "Sobering Night, Personal Post   I have a best friend named Tanitha Kulsiri and she's going to die today.  I believe officially she already is, brain dead I'm told, but I cannot go and see her. I was offered a ride from Philly to the hospital, but already in Trenton and in between trains, it was so far away. I also don't think I could really visit her. I don't know if it would have brought closure or drove me mad from missed opportunities and knowing that she really wasn't there. I do plan on attending the service, that should bring me closure without the dangerous side effects.  Tanitha was in a coma last week from dialysis complications, but pulled through. She  woke up as herself, trying to remove the food tube, pushing out visitors and demanding to go home.  She was expected to recover and was going to get a phone call from me berating her for almost leaving me without me getting her a present (inside joke) and saying 'goodbye.' Other complications followed, and while trying to move her to another hospital she went into cardiac arrest. That was when it ended.  I knew that she had had complications before. She was hospitalized for a little more than month while she was my managing editor at the Temple News.  Tanitha is one of very few friends I have from Temple, and the longest from there. She's 22 and this isn't supposed to happen. We first met over alcohol and parties in Temple Towers Apt. 109E. It led to revelations such as: 'I sit behind you in Newswriting I!' From there it was work on the Temple News, more classes and faulty group projects over the summer, into Apt. 409E. Finally culminating as my No. 2 at the News.  We'd fallen out of each other's light following my graduation and only kept in contact through IM and on rare face-to-face occasions, because the two of us were working, and she still in school. But every time we talked again, it was as if the time away hadn't happened. We had recently started talking again daily and had planned on meeting. I guess this is how it goes when you put things off and don't seize the opportunity.  I'd missed more than one opportunity with her. I really cared for her and she's one of the few girls I'd wanted to date. Feisty, witty, intelligent and beautiful. Plus she could actually stand being around me. And Tanitha, regardless of what you say, I'm bi, not gay. There's a difference, obviously. Its been 8 years, I know how it goes.  She'd been my partner in crime at Temple. From skipping classes, to causing havoc for our newspaper adviser and probably a professor or two. There was also the underage drinking, and I still have that shot glass she left at my place, and I never returned; a source of contention through all the years.  There were the regular trips to the Chinese roach coach for dumplings, dinners at the Cheesecake Factory and god help me, trips to Abercrombie.  We also regularly called off outings, something I'm bound to regret, because that was always the beginning of our little falling outs, but that was just how we worked.  Tanitha was a big part of my formative years, personally, that is. At Textile I was a mess, but I started getting my act together at Temple. So much of that involved the News (probably something to lament) and the people I met there (not something to lament) and the few relationships I've carried beyond that time.  I talked to a long-lost friend Lauren, photo editor for me at the News and it felt good to talk about this with someone else who knew her. An earlier conversation with a friend didn't help, but I also hadn't yet had the train ride home to process everything.  Early morning discussions with Dev and Jigsha helped close out the day, and I might actually close my eyes tonight before a new day.  A different day.

        "blog_text": "Today was the day I departed for Washington D.C. for the “pre” evaluation tests associated with my being a donor for my sister’s bone marrow transplant scheduled for mid-august sometime. I have to have various tests undertaken at John Hopkins Medical Centre in Baltimore on Thursday and Friday. I return to Vancouver on Sunday. Subject to any schedule changes, I return back to Washington D.C. during the week of August 2nd for pre-operative checks on August 5th and the actual transplant on August 6th.   En-route, I was once again subject to the “disheartening” practices of US immigration. Right clicking on the word “disheartening” in MS-WORD and using its thesaurus, one gets “intimidating”, “off-putting”, “discouraging”, “scary”, “frightening”, “overwhelming”, and “demoralizing”; all of these words apply. Their Special Registration processes essentially starts with a blatant accusation that the Canadian government has issued me a false passport – meaning that my nationality as a Canadian citizen is not recognized by the US government, even though I carry a valid Canadian passport. Once my nationality is discounted, I am screen based on my place of birth: Tehran, Iran. Although I left Iran in 1979 when I was 12 years old and never to return, my place of birth signifies that I pose a threat to the American public and that I should be finger printed and photographed each time I enter and exit the US. It is difficult for me to pinpoint what bothers me most about this:   the fact that I became a Canadian to escape the racism that Iranians face?  the fact that it is humiliating to be designated as a second class Canadian citizen?  the fact that the US immigration staff that execute their government’s distorted policies come from the most vile bowels of society?  the fact that I am not a threat to anyone?  the fact that the largest state sponsor of terror in the world is the United States of America?  the fact that I must endure what I am exposed to because a life is at stake?   Although I may not know what bothers me most about this, I know what helps me endure it, and that is threefold: firstly and most importantly I will be able to battle something that is a threat to all of us (cancer), secondly – I will be able to raise this issue (once again) with the media and Canada’s federal government and hopefully rectify it through the appropriate channels, and thirdly, I can choose to not travel to the US for any other purposes. These reasons empower me to fool the immigration officials to think that I am complying with respect, even though deep down inside I am revolted by everything that they stand for.  And alas, this is exactly what I did today; I complied with respect and after the 2 hour ordeal was able to catch my flight arrive in DC on the eve of my appointments at the hospital and on time.",

In fact, the word I use most often when describing people is suck. But know what? My misanthropic tendencies don’t stop me from having manners. I usually say please, I always say thank you, and if someone takes the time to smile and say hello to me, I will almost always return the greeting.   I was having a discussion with a friend yesterday about why I feel so isolated. In part, he placed the blame on the city I live in. I grew up in Boston so I know how it is. I know the people here are atypically guarded. But I decided to see just how bad it really was. I set out on a mission yesterday. I walked from Union Square in Somerville to Central Square in Cambridge and then up and down Mass Ave – round trip I probably walked about 5 miles. During the entire walk I tried to make eye contact with people. I had a smile on my face the whole time – trying to get the same out of at least one person. At best, I got a handful of half smiles, but most people just turned their heads in order to avoid the eye contact.   So what gives Cambridge? Is it really that hard to return a smile? It doesn’t take much energy. I’m not looking to start a conversation. No time is wasted. You have nothing to lose. When I was in Honolulu I returned a smile from a stranger on the street and several hours later we were skinny dipping on Waikiki Beach. It was one of the most impulsive, fantastic nights of my life (and no, there was no sex involved), and it was all initiated with a smile.   I know this is a new concept up here so I’m going to give the people of Cambridge some slack. But I’m going to keep doing this walk until I get a better response. I’m going to make this city more polite if it kills me. So if you see some asshole girl with a giant grin on her face staring at you – don’t be afraid. Just fucking smile back. I swear it won’t kill you. Who knows? You might even enjoy it.",

I know Dad changed his name to mine, maybe as a way to never forget the 7 year old he left behind.  I understand. I heard rumors about where he was and what he was doing and I would brush them off with a joke or an aside.  I have been telling people my father died for over 10 years.

I've been thinking about this for some time.  Probably since that really unflattering picture of me went up on ACF.  This whole being fat, thing.  Lets just get this right out in the open, if it was a mystery before.  I am.  I'm big, heavy, thick, rubenesque, lush, curvy, fat, however you like to describe it, I'm it.  I wear a size 20.  I cant shop in normal stores, I have to go to the plus size sections.  I have a 38 waist.  My measurements, in fact, are 40DD, 38, 42.  I'm 5 foot 8.  Try and add all that up in your head, and try not to hurt yourself doing it.   I wear good clothes, and I make extra sure theyre flattering.  I spend a lot of time thinking about clothes.  I love clothes, and I really hate to see people poorly dressed.  Clothes really can make a person.   Lets take this a step further, and really pull out some imagery.  Ive got wide football player shoulders, big upper arms,  and big tits.  Im young and I have great posture, so they stand up, and point forward still, I get a lot of compliments about them, and I like showing them off.  I have a faint waistline, and hips...well, no hips.  If I was thin, theyd be described as 'boyish' but, Im not.  So, the overall effect is rather columnar.  Well, a column with huge tits.  My lower legs and thighs are still tight, and I like to think of them as powerful.  Theyre not covered in cellulite, and you dont have to look to hard to see muscle definition.  In fact, my calf muscles ripple when I walk.  I like looking at my legs, when I walk, I think its pretty sexy.  I keep them tanned, tattooed, and tight, and I like to show them off.  In the past few years, though, Im developing a nice layer of fat, around the back of my thighs.  I cant see it, so no biggie, but, its there.  I have a round, ample belly, which is my second least favorite area (well get to my least favorite in a sec)  Its a point of issue for me, because they design girls shirts, so that the hemline bisects it, and you get this nice roll of flab, hanging out.  I combat that, by wearing a lot of skirts, which skim right over the problem area, or, mens tee shirts, which cover it up.  My ass is strange.  Out of clothes, its cute, little, and round.  In clothes, its totally flat.  I have a few pairs of jeans that do it justice, but mostly, its forgettable.  My face, though.  I talked about that a little before, but, my face really pisses me off.  I feel like that two faced chick from Seinfeld.  I look good in one light, but not the other.  I have good face days, and bad.  I have long straight hair, that reaches my lower back, and short little bangs.  I have a widows peak, and a very pointy little chin, with a slight cleft, that make a perfect heart shape.  In between, are some nice arched eyebrows (I get complimented on my eyebrows a lot, for some reason) almond shaped green eyes, a rounded pug nose, huge full cheeks, pouty soft lips with a very defined bow, and my pointy chin.  Framing all that is a nice layer of fat.  That I hate.  I really really hate it.  It shows up when I dont want it to, in pictures.  I can work on my abs, and keep that ample belly high and tight.  I can do lunges and leg lifts to keep my shit toned.  I can lift, and stuff for my arms, but what the fuck am I gonna do about all this face fat?  Even when I was thin, I had face fat.  So, there we go, theres an honest, in depth description of myself.  Take it without bitterness, without conceit, without self deprecation, without neediness.  Its observation, inventory, and acceptance.  Accept it, or dont, but thats what this entry is about.  My acceptance, and the things that shake it.    Lemme start with being a fat kid.  I wasnt fat till about 5th grade.  As a matter of fact, from when I was born, till about 2nd grade, I was severely underweight.  I weighed 3 lbs 8 oz, when I was born.  I have very fine bones, and a small frame.  I was downright angular, when I was a kid.  We moved to NJ, when my dad and mom got divorced, and my mom stopped being Mrs. Domestic, and started being Miss Catch-Me-A-Man.  She stopped cooking all together, and I subsisted largely (pun HAH) on grocery store brand frozen dinners, generic canned pasta dishes, ramen noodles, government subsidied food (gubment cheese stains your teeth yellow) and, the occasional Polish meal from my grandmother.   I am not going to be one of those blame laying fat people, but it is what it is.  I would go days without meat and vegetables, and eat whole pots of mashed potatoes with butter, for dinner.  I developed deplorable habits, and food addictions when I was a child, and Im only just getting over them now.  So, where was I...5th grade, right.  That was when I first started getting teased about weight.  Before then, I got singled out, because of my accelerated learning, and being in the G&T classes (gifted and talented).  Add fat to bookish, and you have a kids worst nightmare.  I got bullied daily, from 5th grade on.  I would sit on the playground, reading, and certain kids would mosey on over, and pick a fight with me, just because of what I was wearing, or, shit, for no reason at all.   Let me share a few horror stories, for posterity.  Ive never committed any of this to print, before, but I think Im ready to.  Once, I was at the local park, (I used to live there, just about, it was a block away from my house, and sprawling acres of alone places...digressing) and, I was by myself on a tire swing, standing up, and leaning on the chain, sorta swinging lazily.  I didnt hear them, but this whole group of kids from my school came up behind me. I thought I was alone.  I one swift motion, they knocked me off the swing, and whipped my pants down.  PANTS they did it to everyone.  Only, that day...I was wearing these special underwear my mom got me, to hold my tummy in.  They were these huge granny panties.  Ive never worn huge underwear since.  It took me (and them) almost a year to get over it.  I feel shamed, and choked up typing it out now.  I was 11.  There was the name calling, the comments, the bullshit.  Kids would look for things to insult me about.   In 8th grade, I went through the classic scene.  One day at lunch, Popular Hot Guy came over to me, and was like hey, are you going to the prom?  (we had an 8th grade prom)  I was like probably  He said wanna go with me?  I flushed...because he really was good looking, and I thought, one of the nicer people around.  He'd never given me a problem before, he generally ignored me...so, Im thinking, ooh, lucky break, right?  Sure, Id like that  He said (and Ill never forget it to this day, so help me god) I bet you would, haha, but what makes you think Id want to go with your lardass? He moseyed back to his friends, and they all had a good chuckle.   (semi-related side note:  He spent time in jail, later on.  He now lives with his baby momma, in her daddys house, and get this, shes a porker.  Gogo karma I love living in a small town.)   Thats enough torturing myself.  There was a lot.  I got into about 14 fights between 5th and 8th grade.  All over stupid nonsense.  I was such a doormat, too.   Toward the end of 8th grade, I started evolving, though.  I started hanging out with the boys.  The really smart boys, the fucked up ones, the poor kids, the metalheads, the nerds, freaks, etc.  We all started listening to metal around the same time.  My best buddy Phil had tourettes syndrome.  This guy Artie that I used to hang with, was voted 8th grade validictorian, but, he got busted smoking pot on school grounds a week before graduation, heh.  8th grade.  So, yeah, we all sort of developed a rep.  I did wind up going to the prom, with this kid, who later became my first boyfriend.  We all stood in the hallway in our socks, and bare feet, them in their rented tuxes (for some reason they all wore tails.  Pretty hot, and strange) and drank out of a shared stolen pint of Jack Daniels.  Slagging on the popular kids, getting drunk, and requesting Metallica songs.  Good times good times.  That summer was awesome, I lost my virginity, ran wild, and took ownership of my self.  I started winning fights.  I started dressing like the boys, in flannels and denim, and I learned how to skate.  I stole a Mongoose, and learned how to work on it.  I biked, and skated, and fucked around.  By the time 9th grade rolled around, I was a full on asskicking metal chick.  I went to high school, with a new attitude, and new identity.  I grew a few inches, and leaned out.  I sprouted breasts, and got (meager) hips.  My hair grew out (in 8th grade, I had a bowl cut) so, I stopped looking like a boy, and started playing with them.  When I left 8th grade, I left the insults behind.  I swear to god, I never was insulted about my weight after that.  Just didnt happen.  I barely got into fights, and, our crowd was considered scary.   So, yeah, I outgrew the fat insults, and I lived it up.  Went on like that for all of my teens.  Starting at 13.  Fast forward to age 20.  I settled down, and gained weight.  Worked nights, ate at a diner every single night, at 10 p.m. Shit food, too, gravy fries, cheesesteaks, just, the worst shit.  I gained 40lbs in 2 months.  The first time I couldnt get my size 14 jeans to button, I was hysterical. I cried all night, we didnt wind up going out, I hid in the bedroom sobbing.  The mister convinced me, that all women mature, and he assured me that my body was just changing, as I evolved into a woman.  Yeah, bullshit.  I got pregnant 2 months later, and by then, I gained fully 80 lbs.  After I had my son, I was all but bedridden for a few months, due to major complications, and I never lost that weight.   Two years later, I had pneumonia, that went untreated, for a month, and bronchitis for over a year.  Long story short, major scar tissue in my lungs, and  I couldnt walk between rooms, without getting winded.  Hello another 40 lbs.   Ive always been active.  The health problems laid me up, and I went into the worst depression of my life.  During all this weight gain, the mister assured me that I was still his goddess, etc, still beautiful, but I was very hard on myself.  God, I was so depressed.  Right around that time, too, Tom killed himself, and the whole 9-11 thing, I just wasnt happy for a whole year. Just thinking about it is making me want to cry.  I was a size 24.  Somehow, I got out of that, did two more semesters of school, then the house thing happened. I didnt have time to wallow in my own self pity, after that, I was too busy worrying about being homeless.  The beginning of this year, the mister and I decided to make some changes.  He went on a full on diet.  Lost almost 90 lbs.  I  didnt go on any diet, but I started eliminating poisons from my own regimen.  No junk food, no refined sugar, hydrogenated shit, no more crap.  No more shit food.  Not a diet, but, a descision.  I woke up, one day, at my moms house, after I tested my blood, on her diabetes thing.  My blood sugar level was astronomical.  Up there around borderline diabetic.  I dropped 40 lbs, like *that* without even trying.  Im still not trying.  Im training myself, though.  I work out now, I do basic yoga and pilates, and I can do 3 miles on treadmill at 5 mph, without wheezing.   Its a good feeling, to be out of breath, but not ready to collapse and die, seeing stars.   I do dozens and dozens of reps with 15 lb weights, daily.(I know, sounds like nothing, but I couldnt go get the mail without having to catch my breath.  Thank you pneumonia.)  I love the control of pilates and yoga, I love feeling my body elongate, and controling myself that way.  I like the power involved, and the concentration.  When I first started, I felt like an akward oaf, now Im getting more graceful.  I still eat, I dont deny myself much, but the difference is (and theres a big one) food isnt like IT anymore.  My day used to revolve around meals.  Now, I make other stuff more important.  Food addiction is a hard one to kick, because you have to eat to live.  People dont need to smoke to live.  You have to go out of your way to get cigarettes.  Food, theres food everywhere. I have to cook three meals of it, a day, at least.  I used to work in kitchens professionally.  I LOVE FOOD.  I read cookbooks, for LEISURE.  Food science and chemistry is a major hobby of mine.  Its unavoidable, so I had to change my mindset. It's working, slowly.  Slowly.  So, this is where Im at now.  Acceptance, progress, change.  Im sort of meeting myself half way here.  I was sick of being a slug, so Im changing that.  Im less about losing weight, and more about getting healthy.  Ive accepted my size, and for the most part, how the world views me.  Frankly, I think fat is sexy, on me, and on other people.  I love the way my skin feels, and the generousness of my hips. I run my hands over my belly, and like that roundness. I feel fertile, and lush, and goddesslike.  Im adding grace and strength to that, and I feel good, and I feel like I look good.  Im owning my fat, once again.   They saw my picture a few weeks ago, on ACF.  First time Ive heard nasty, bullying barbs about my weight, since I was 13.  Thirteen years, and the insults have come full circle.  It doesnt hurt, anymore, though, not like it used to.  It used to lessen my self worth, when I was young. I felt like a lesser person.  It hurt, it made me hate, and it made me want to isolate myself, and fight, and I did.  Now, Im a fighter, and I hate, still.  I look down on those people, like they looked down on me when I was a kid.  It feels, now, though, that these grownups have to insult my appearance, because they have nothing else.  They cant touch my logic, or my personality.  They have to go for cheap, easy shots, and attack my size.  How...8th grade, of them.  I wonder, though, would they do it in a real life setting?  Would they attack someone they worked with, in such a way?  Do they yell at the girl behind the counter for screwing up an order, and call her a fat bitch?  Some people do, actually.  When I got into that brawl with my contractor, the first insult out of his mouth was (again, till the day I die, Ill never forget this) fat psycho cunt  then fat dike bitch  Now, though, its less about me, and more about society.  Is this what its about?  Is that all people see?  Thats one thing Im still having a hard time coping with.  What people see, when they see me.  The fat is always a first impression, I see it in peoples eyes, in the split second, when we first meet.  Its like hello fat, hello Lisa  Fat first, Lisa second.  I make up for that, though.  I look eccentric.  I try extra hard to be different in other ways.  I try to be extra learned, and extra super witty.  I have a great sense of humor.  All these things, I do to eradicate that first impression.  Its my arsenal of self-protection, my way of standing out.      This entry was a long time coming.  Ive been dancing around it, for awhile.  It feels good to pour it all out. I think I can sleep well, again.",

        "blog_text": "You know  CALI like in California. I have had to repeat this phrase over and over since I named my dog Cali, yes  really , as in California. My Dad still insists on calling the dog Collie. He wanted me to name him Terwilliger, after a street in Portland. Sit Terwilliger, come Terwilliger...just couldn't see it.   Moving is a big deal. Moving across country is a nightmare. Having arrived as a new settler to California from my home state of Florida, my German Shepherd dog of ten years promptly expired. I grieved for six months until one day my boyfriend, tired of my crying spells BUT supportive, drove me out Highway 20 to the Mendocino County Humane Society. There were three litters of puppies and seven adult dogs. We spent an afternoon crawling into the kennels when the staff wasn't looking and fondling all the dogs. One black and white puppy appealed to me. He was more 'attentive' than his litter mates, easy to handle and had great markings. But I wasn't ready to buy. Besides my boyfriend thought we shouldn't do something on a  whim .  He  was eyeing a sand colored female lab mix in another litter.   It worked! My mind wasn't on my lost German Shepherd anymore. I was thinking about this new puppy. What would he be like? I wanted a female dog. Should I get this one even though he's a male? In the next three weeks we 'visited' the puppies every four or five days. It became a pastime: watching for new dogs, ones that were coming out of quarantine and once in a while petting some cats too. Look at how large this one has gotten! What kind of a mix do you think this one is? My favorite continued to be the black and white. He and his litter mates had come down with kennel cough so the drama of his recovery compelled us to come back as well. On the afternoon he was finally 'cleared' we finally left the Humane Society with a puppy.  I came up with a list of dozens of dog names, went to all those dog sites on the web and reviewed names until my eyes watered with fatigue. There were mens names, Indian names, weather names, place names, etc. on the list. I would email my boyfriend names and when he came home at the end of the day, we would look at the list and say the names, over and over...here Cheyenne, sit Dakota, come Zephyr. One day I was talking to a friend about my new puppy and my old dog and I found myself saying...'not my Florida dog, my California dog.' This is typical of me and the result of over-education, generate lots of activity and finally having not worked it out intellectually in a moment of conversation have the AHA! 'That's it, Cali! He's our little California dog.' Not too original but easy to say.",

        "blog_text": "I'm not the selected one to give the speech on graduation's day. So as I promised, this is my speech...     When I decided to take this course – the Diploma in Professional Chef Training, there were many raised eyebrows because it is non-conforming for someone who was a science student. Taking a course that is not a norm and dealing with something like “cooking”, is not well perceived by people who regard doctors, lawyers and architects having better careers.    As for me, I perceive it differently. I used to be a computer science student who had to deal with binary codes, zeros and ones. These two numbers are the possibilities that we will never know. It all depends on how you arrange and execute it, which will bring the difference and results that you wanted. It may take some time to program it, but at the end, we may achieve the result according to our objectives. It’s almost the same with our journey in this life. There are a lot of possibilities and opportunities that we will never know. All we have to do is to explore them. Take the risks with all the guts and if we ever stumble some uncertainties, bear in mind that someone will be there if you need any help. This is how I feel for the past few years. All the impossible thoughts that I had faded away gradually. I have gained new knowledge and a new spirit that has brought me here where I am standing. To me impossible means nothing. Impossible is just a negative thought that holds back our dreams.    During my years in local university, all I knew was about going to the classes, doing all the projects and getting good grades. This just wasn’t me. I became tired and lost my affection towards it. I had lost, not only the direction but in my battle without not even knowing what is it all about. Then, I had to make drastic changes. Changing the path of my life – to do something that I am really fond of - so I decided to pursue my study to become a chef. Studying in KDU, I had achieved something that is not only academic achievement but personal rewarding experiences. It’s like a part of my dream has come true. I could see myself changing. I have gained confidence that I had lost during my studies in the local university. I learned to motivate myself here in KDU.     Motivation is the key of changing yourself to be better that you used to be. I motivated myself to be a competitor, competing with myself. It’s the only way for me to prove that in all I have done, I have tried my best. I motivate to see the changes in myself. I motivate to get good grades. After I had done with the motivation, I have to develop it as a habit. Because there’s a phrase saying that ‘Motivation is what you get started, habit is what keeps you going’. A’s is not something that I can get easily, but it’s something that I earned with the hard work I have put in. Getting good grades is not all of it. I still enjoy the everyday life here and have fun doing it with all my beloved friends. I live to the max everyday, because I know if I ever hold it back, tomorrow would not be the same as today. I will not get the same opportunity again.    After this graduation, we are going to be disconnected from the familiar surrounding – we will be venturing to another milieu that makes us feel that we are aliens. It will give us the greatest challenge. It will be totally different from the college life that we used to. We have to re-adjust to fit in. We have to apply what we have learned in KDU – be resourceful, be independent and create opportunities for ourselves. Believe me, it is a cruel, cruel world out there. Just be ready for the challenges. But it should give us a new spirit to believe in yourself and to be strong. Because someone who is strong mentally and emotionally, has a different attitude towards life and the people around him. Someone who is strong thinks positively even at the bleakest hours! Someone who is strong will not blame or complain, but will find a solution to problems instead of moan and groan.    Don’t get intimidated with future colleagues because if we show any weakness, they will take advantage over us. Show them that you have the capabilities of doing the same things and even much better; you just need time to be polished. Don’t despair if what you plan did not work out well, because failure does not mean to stop trying, it is just a reminder that we are human. We have limited capabilities and it is alright to fail, but it does not mean we should stop trying; in fact, it should awaken us to be more patient and to be more resilient. This is a process of learning. Many times we think that we know so much just because we have a paper or a position to justify how much we know. But in actual fact, the learning process never stops. Even at the lowest point, we’ll never stop learning.    Today, we have managed to set our foot to be in this ceremony, but the journey has just begun - the journey of pursing our dreams which we have conceived in our mind. Show the world what we are made of, because nobody in this world can hold us from reaching our dreams.     KDU has provided us with the platform, and I know that all of us can make the difference to realise our dreams.    Before I end this speech, I would like to say my gratitude towards the people who have guided me, helped me and be present around me; to the lecturers, thank you for your constant guide and support and let me be a part of the KDU family. To my friends, thanks for every sweet moment that we had shared together and last but most importantly to my beloved parents and family, without their unconditional support and love, I don’t think I would even be standing here. Thank you.  By the way... This is my 50th post...",

        "blog_text": "Daphne Merkin's Cate Blanchett Profile in the NYT Mag   For quite some time  Cate Blanchett  has obsessed me strongly but I could never quite figure out why. I mean,  Daniel Day Lewis  and  Meryl Streep  and  Liv Ullman  are also  lo ultimo , or the best at what they do, which is acting. But there is something more about Cate Blanchett's project, the great work of her life, than there is to the other actors.    I think the key to Cate Blanchett and what makes her so haunting is Liv Ullman, who makes a brief appearance in  Daphne Merkin's  perceptive piece (p.78, Sunday Times) -- the most perceptive interview, incidentally, I have ever read on the mysterious subject of Cate Blanchett. Merkin mentions that Blanchett and Ullman have been talking.  Apparently Blanchett is a fan of Ullman as director. Interesting. Ullman is definitely in that rarified stratosphere of world directors, after her work on  Kristin Lavransdatter  and  Faithless , which made a strong showing in Cannes in 2000. But Ullman is more famous as perhaps the greatest female actress in the history of cinema, which, I would argue, also means that Ullman may be the greatest  actor  in cinema, period.   Ingmar Bergman is in my opinion the greatest filmmaker in the history of cinema. That lone Victorian-Modernist voice, so full of harsh close ups, post-Christian angst,  Freud ,  Bach  and  Mozart , strange civil wars, failures of communication, discordant romantic betrayals interspersed with  familial comfort all served as background, in a way, to highlight Liv Ullman's historic performances. Ullman's strong work braught Ingmar's deepest feelings on human existence in the world. Bergman's pick up line on Ullman, it has been said, was 'I believe that I will have a beautiful but painful tie to you for the rest of my life.' Who wouldn't fall for a line like that?  Of course saying that is simplifying things greatly.  Max Von Sydow  served as Bergman's animus even while Ullman served as his anima, but I still believe that acting in cinema in the 20th century begins and ends with the Bergman-Ullman collaborations of high modernism. But this is a blog, so forgive me if I simplify a bit.  So that brings me back to Daphne Merkin's  perceptive article on Cate Blanchett . Why would Merkin not draw the obvious comparisons to Blanchett, who is clearly Ullman's successor, or at least would-be-successor, in acting and not directing. Well, for one, we may be treated to Liv Ullman  directing  Blanchett as Nora in a film version of ' A Doll's House .' When Blanchett approached Ullman as a fan of her directing, it was a courtship of sorts. And the courtship appears to have borne fruit.  To a film geek like me this is big stuff. Then again, aren't we  all  film geeks now? Don't we all apply thought to the countless films we see -- on tv at the neighborhood bar, on TiVo, on Movies on Demand, on HBO, on DVD, at press screenings?   Anyway, back to the scariness of  Cate Blanchett . I have never seen an actress so disappear into their roles in the manner that Blanchett does. That quality of acting is particular to her. She disappears into, say, the single southern mother in The Gift -- accent and all-- charging that character with her own peculiar cool energy. Meryl Streep also does this brilliantly, of course, with flawless accent, as well, but Streep does it with  humanitarian intent   in mind. Her characters are often (always?) flawed people whom she inhabits and makes touching, human, worthy of compassion. I'm thinking here of  The French Lieutenants Woman , the tormented mother in  Kramer vs Kramer , Sophie in  Sophie's Choice . All of these flawed characters do not immediately elicit sympathy, but through the strength of her performances, Streep ethically forces the viewer to turn towards the characters and engage them as flawed but all too human.  Ullman's project, on the other hand, has evolved from the Bergman-centered expressions of angst and infinity rendered startlingly in the claustrophobic close ups where emotions are pushed to their outermost limits. I am thinking here of the scene in  Cries and Whispers  where the two sisters  Kirin  and  Maria , long stranged and cold towards each other, put aside all differences as their third sister lies dying. In the close up, the two sisters come towards each other, fall into one anothers arms, embrace, kiss, and let all the years of animostity evaporate on screen. Dialogue dissolves into a particularly intense Sarabande from  Bach's Cello Suite No. 5 . An infinity of emotions in one scene.   The evolution of Ullman's 'activity' has now progressed from playing those roles for Bergman into a sort of multidimensional 'conversation,' or, rather, competition with Bergman in the realm of directing. Ironically she directs many films in which he actually writes the screenplay. A complex relationship, to say the least. Beautiful ... just like Bergman said in his pick up line.  But what does that have to do with  Cate Blanchett ? Well, Blanchett's project is not Meryl Streep's or even Ullman's, nor is it  Daniel Day Lewis' , who, though brilliant, sometimes seems on the verge of giving himself a mental breakdown, not so much dissolving into his characters, but conquering and enslaving them through violence, at risk to his own sanity. No,  Cate Blanchett   is the most interesting and strange case in that strangest profession of them all: acting.   Daphne Merkin gets it just about right here:  'A day or two before I meet her, I admit to a movie afficionado friend that I cannot remember the role she played in  'The Talented Mr. Ripley ,' and he sheepishly concedes that he can't remember either. It was said of the great English character actress  Peggy Ashcroft  that she didn't have a face, and in the sense of not seeming to be fixed in her own physyognomy, Blanchett doesn't have one either.'  That is precisely what is so scary about Cate Blanchett. Not the impossible talent, though it is doubtlessly there: but the fact that when one looks back to the actor of any one of her brilliant performances ... one doesn't know who to cheer.  Who is Cate Blanchett ? Is she the face of  Donna Karan ? Is she the fashion icon who appears on countless magazine covers yet displays absolutely no emotion to Merkin on the subject, even going so far as to show disdain for, what she calls 'lipstick talk'? Is she  Veronica Guerin ? Is she the pregnant mother of a child and a wife? Who is she?  Merkin askes Blanchett if she considers Veronica Guerin's lack of box office success despite her strong work as a result of taking on a Julia Roberts-type role:  'Who knows,' (Blanchett) asks, putting her finger on the existential mystery that underlies the construction of any screen persona, 'who  Julia Roberts   really is?'  And then I finally figured out what is so scary about Cate Blanchett. Blanchett is the mother and wife and actress and model-spokesperson who stares at us from the magazine covers and the screen, she is all of those things. But they are all roles, waystations on an unknown destination. Asking who is Cate Blanchett is like asking What is a Self.

When I saw all the people there, I started to complain to myself: \n'It is going to take forever here and I still have so many other places to go...' \nChristmas really is getting more and more annoying every year. How I wish I could just lie down, go to sleep and only wake up after it. \nNonetheless, I made my way to the toy section, and there I started to curse the prices, wondering if kids really play with such expensive toys. \nWhile looking in the toy section, I noticed a small boy of about 5 years old, pressing a doll against his chest. He kept on touching the hair of the doll and looked so sad. I wondered who this doll was for. \nThen the little boy turned to the old woman next to him: 'Granny, are you sure I don't have enough money?' \nThe old lady replied: 'You know that you don't have enough money to buy this doll, my dear.' \nThen she asked him to stay here for 5 minutes while she went to look around. She left quickly. \nThe little boy was still holding the doll in his hand. \nFinally, I started to walk towards him and asked who he wanted to give this doll to. \n'It is the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for this Christmas. She was so sure that Santa Claus would bring it to her.' \nI replied to him that maybe Santa Claus will bring it to her, after all, and not to worry. But he replied to me sadly. \n'No, Santa  Claus can not bring it to her where she is now. I have to give the doll to my mother so that she can give it to her when she goes there.' \nHis eyes were so sad while saying this. \n'My sister has gone to be with God. Daddy say that Mummy will also go to see God very soon, so I thought that she could bring the doll with her to give it to my sister'. \nMy heart nearly stopped. \nThe little boy looked up at me and said: 'I told daddy to tell mummy not to go yet. I asked him to wait until I come back from the supermarket' \nThen he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing. He then told me: 'I also want mummy to take this photo with her so that she will not forget me.' \nI love my mummy and I wish she doesn't have to leave me but daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister' \nThen he looked again at the doll with sad eyes, very quietly. \nI quickly reached for my wallet and took a few notes and said to the boy. 'What if we checked again, just in case if u have enough money?' \n'Ok' he said. 'I hope that I have enough.' \nI added some of my money to his without him seeing and we started to count it. There was enough for the doll, and even some spare money. \nThe little boy said: 'Thank you God for giving me enough money' then he looked at me and added: 'I asked yesterday before I slept for God to make sure I have enough money to buy this doll so that mummy can give it to my sister. He heard me' \n'I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mummy, but I didn't dare to ask God too much. But He gave me enough to buy the doll and the white rose.' \n'You know, my mummy loves white rose' \nA few minutes later, the old lady came again and I left with my trolley. I finished my shopping in a totally different state from whenI started. I couldn't get the little boy out of my mind. \nThen I remembered a local newspaper article 2 days ago, which mentioned of a drunk man in a truck who hit a car where there was one young lady and a little girl. The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a critical state.The family had to decide whether to pull the plug on the life-assisting machine, because the young lady would not be able to get out of the coma. \nWas this the family of the little boy? \nTwo days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the newspaper that the young lady had passed away. \nI couldn't stop myself and went to buy a bunch of white roses and I went to the mortuary where the body of the young woman was exposed for people to see and make last wish before burial. \nShe was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful white rose in her hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest. \nI left the place crying, feeling that my life had been  changedforever. \nThe love that this little boy had for his mother and his sister is still, to that day, hard to imagine. \nAnd in a fraction of a  second, a drunk man had taken all this away from him.",

        "blog_text": "A WATCHED POT ALWAYS BOILS  It's very true. The title of this blog is a recent discovery I made. I had to boil two eggs, and it was my first time in my 22 years of attempting such a thing. In order to to do this I first had to boil some water. And I watched the water boil. And it did.   It too a long time. Very long. When I saw the first bubble rise I thought, 'there we go. Now she'll pick it up and REALLY start to boil.' This was not the case. I watched longer and longer and longer and eventually more bubbles rose, and then more. Time passed very slowly, but eventually the pot did boil under my total supervision.  I reccomend this excerscise to everyone simply because it puts to rest not only the comment, 'A Watched pot never boils', but the very notion of such a thing. Obviously it will boil if you watch it. But maybe in ignoring the watchnig part we really do come to a point where we expect it NOT to boil if we watch it. Which is to say that if we leave something, a task tedious as it may be, somehow it will solve itself.  Life is filled with these. I make movies. Movies are like the pot. I make them though. I'm trying to make a website right now. One bubble at a time. And sometimes I want to put my fist through the computer screaming because I just want to SEE my website, perfect and finished. No questions asked. But this is because I am unaccustomed to watching a pot boil, let alone taking part in the prrocess. The pot never gets frustrated when it boils. It goes through the same motion every time. The water never gets bored, or tired. The fire doesn't throw up it's hands in frustration when things don't move fast enough. They all stick it out, take their time, and boilt eh fucking water. Rome wasn't built in a day- sure, I'll beleive that one. But a pot doesn't boil in two seconds either.   I find myself, in general, so result oriented that my entire life is geared towards destinations. How long until we get there, how soon until it's done.. etc. etc. But this is not the point I am finding, and as I realized in watching the pot boil, the pot WILL boil- it is only a matter of time. And to ask the pot to worrry about how long it's taking, or if it's doing this the right way, or if it should try another faster method, or maybe hire another pot or recruit some cleaner watter, or hook up with a better burner... all these things... would be besides the point. The pot would tell you to fuck off because it knows it'll boil and it just needs to sit down, undistrubed and focus for a while, then eventually it'll boil.   The ultimate truth beyond the truth is that once it's boils it's not such a big deal. Drop in yor eggs, move on. Put in the pasta, get the sauce, move on. The pot boiling, no big deal- happened before, it'll happen again. So the end product is ultimately consumed, or forgotten as you slurp down wahtever you needed that boiling water for. What was it all worht then? Just that moment of eating. I guesss some would say so. But I would say it was worth the wait- and worth my attention. People complain that life goes by too fast- mine sure does- but not when you're watching a pot boil it doesn't. You can't believe how slow it gets. Don't watch because your bored, don't watch because you want the eggs hard boiled THAT BADLY, watch because your attention matters.",

        "blog_text": "Quote from the first Spiderman movie. Emphasis on the first three words, because that's how I've been feeling. Yesterday, I spent the whole day at Carowinds with my youth group. Puttered around there for a while, then the concert was at six. Thousand Foot Krutch, Relient K, Day of Fire (new band, they're not bad), and Audio Adrenaline. We left after that, got home around 1:30am. I cried on the bus coming back. No one noticed, not even the girl sitting next to me. I cried driving home. I cried sitting in my driveway. I cried when I went to bed. I was hurting so bad inside. I still feel that pain now. Now, can you read between the lines here? If not, I'll read it for you. Being in such a public place, watching all those people, that would be enough to get me depressed by itself. That was aggravated by the fact that the vast majority of the girls there were wearing bikini tops, I mean, heck, it's part water park, why wouldn't they be? And most guys would be thrilled to be there, for that very reason. So why not me? Haven't you noticed that I have rather ambiguous feelings when it comes to this subject? Okay, yeah, I admit that as a guy, I do like seeing these hot girls running around like they are. But, it is extremely depressing at the same time. The whole 'you can look, but don't touch' and if you look you're still considered a perv. Correct me if I'm wrong, but girls don't like anyone but hot guys checkin' them out. And yet, as I understand, girls WANT their boyfriends to notice how beautiful they are, that's one of the reasons they spend a lot of time trying to look good. Oh, what a line that separates the two situations. An uncrossable line, for me, it seems. Seems to me, there will never be a girl that wants ME to give her that kind of attention.  It's not like I'm asking for the Statue of Liberty to be put in my front yard. Lots of people have what I want....is it too much to want something like what they have? Is it really all that much? Or am I breaking the status quo, rising above my place in society? Am I not supposed to get what I want, this one thing, just because certain elements of society say I'm not good enough? Brittany told me to just stop caring about it, said when she stopped caring about guys, that's when they started asking her out. Sorry to say that I can't. Honestly and truly, that's the face I put on in public, that I have no problems, that I'm not concerned about that. All of what I post on this site, that's private. I only share this with people I trust. I am who I am. I don't want to put on a front, pretend to be someone I'm not. I don't respect people who do that, and so I wouldn't be able to respect myself. So depression's one of my quirks. I'm not always depressed. Most of the time, I'm not. I'm a very humorous person, most of the time. And it's not hard to get me out of a depressed mood. I'm not going to change myself. This is who I am. Accept that. There are people out there who could love someone like me, it's just a question of whether or not I will ever find them, and if I could love them. oh, wow. it's the song that made me cry so hard. the lyrics are so powerful, so true. I'm listening to it right now. 'A Shadow On Me' by Project 86. The chorus goes something like this: 'Can you see a shadow on me, calling me to leave? Find in me a trace of you in all this tragedy.' The last part, they sing something else: 'Can you see the shadow lifting, drifting home again?' I wish so bad that someone could chase away the shadow covering me. The darkness in my life is so thick, I'm scared that no light could ever get through. I know of one that can, but I despair of finding it. Do you know? Love.",

I downloaded a hacked version of messenger that lets me log on automatically as offline so i can see who is about and log on if it's clear.   i still havent spoken to him, partly because he isnt online that much (hooray) and that when he was i hid.  what mark doesnt know though is that when i do speak to him it will be entirely civilised and that if i get dragged into any more meetings with him mark is involved now. hes coming too.  the transcript of any conversation will be up here when its been done.  and if he should ask for it he would get marks phone number, address and be fed lies about how mark is very concerned with the environment and yet feels that he doesnt want to join the militarist boys brigade.  on the upside if i got a virus it would now get to him too",

        "blog_text": "I had a moral conundrum this evening. While attending a screening of Terminator 3: We'll stop making 'em when the cash stops flowing I had the opportunity to stay my temper. Perhaps an explanation is in order; I love movies, I adore the cinema, I detest distractions that are completely out of sync with the film. In the packed house I was seated towards the front of the auditorium. As the film began, from one aisle and one row back, noises began to erupt. The laughter of a small child, altogether unusual, unexpected, and unwelcome in an action movie flowed forth from the seat behind me. 'Great,' thought I, 'betcha this goes on for the whole movie!' As if prophesied by me the disturbance did continue. Through the din and the cussing, the violent gunfire and the calamatous explosions, and sadly even through the ghostly calm the giggling and crying continued. The nature of my ire was exhibited only through the gentle twitch of my right cheek; it's the cheek that indicates 'you're making me angry - you won't like me when I'm angry'. I quelled my rage and focussed instead on the pleasant carnage that ran rampant on the screen - a herculean feat, to be certain. As the film ended and the lights rose, I stood and turned to examine the source of my discontent. As per my expectations I saw a father with his young son and daughter. The young girl was clearly the culprit! I turned to berate her father and... my cry of retribution died in my throat. The young girl was mentally handicapped. The split second decision that I made lasted just slightly longer than eternity. I closed my mouth, turned and exited the theatre. I'm not sure if I did the right thing. Terminator 3 is a movie for adults. It is rated AA, which in Canada is a great way to say 'It's an R film that we'd like to make more money from - BRING THE WHOLE FAMILY!'. There was nudity, coarse language and violence in so grand a scale that even I was impressed. Is this appropriate entertainment for children, let alone a child whose mental faculties may be diminished? It seemed to me that the young girl was there mostly because dad wanted to be there and was too selfish to wait a few weeks until their presence would be less of a disturbance. I felt guilty for thinking this - after all, is it my place to say when anyone can enjoy anything? There indeed is where my dilemma falls. I want my money back, not from the theatre, but from an inconsiderate dad.",

        "blog_text": "When we were first assigned to create reflective writings as apart of our ethics class assignments, I knew immediately what I wanted to reflect on, but I also knew that I was not ready to share my feelings about an event that happened in late April to some close friends. The events of this weekend however, have brought me back to this topic and have decided to at least attempt to work out some of what I am feeling by using this reflective writing technique.  My husband and I attend College Park Baptist Church just north of Downtown Orlando. I would describe our church as moderate Baptist, but most Baptists would describe us as liberal (we are NOT apart of the extremely conservative Southern Baptist Convention). I was married in December and had been attending a Sunday school class for young married couples as an engaged person for nearly a year. One of the anchor couples in our class, Tammy and Galen, had become a mentor couple for Brant and I, and we spent a lot of time going out to lunch and socializing with Tammy and Galen and their one year old son Ethan. When we returned home from our honeymoon in early January we were distressed to hear that Ethan had stopped eating and was seemingly in great pain and had been visiting his pediatrician several times a week to try and discover what was wrong. We continued to pray for Ethan, and even babysat for him several times during this period so that his parents could have a little bit of a break. In late February, after over fifteen visits to the pediatrician who continued to insist that Ethan was just colicky, Tammy and Galen demanded a referral to a gastroenterologist. It took about another week, and an initial incorrect diagnosis of pediatric pancreatic cancer, to discover that Ethan had a stem cell tumor engulfing nearly every organ in his abdomen. Although the tumor was inoperable, the doctors were extremely optimistic that they could shrink the tumor in four rounds of chemo and then remove the tumor, thus curing Ethan and having a nearly zero percent chance of remission. Survival rates from stem cell cancers are nearly 90% and everyone was happy to know that Ethan would be fine.  During Ethan’s first three rounds of chemo everything went incredibly well. He maintained an appetite, even gaining a few pounds, was more active than ever, and celebrated his second birthday. Brant and I visited Tammy, Galen, and Ethan several  times in the hospital and at home during this month and a half long process, and were  always encouraged to see Ethan healthier and happier than before. On Tuesday April 27,  2004 Ethan went into the hospital for his fourth and final round of chemo. Tammy had  told me that in her last doctor’s visit with the pediatric oncologist he had told her that he sees terminal cases all day long, but that in no way was Ethan terminal. Ethan was scheduled to leave the hospital on Monday May 3rd and it was even thought that he may not have to have surgery to remove the tumor because it had shrunken so much that it was no longer visible on CT scans. On Thursday morning April 29th I got a page with my husband’s cell phone number while I was at work. I called him immediately, since he normally doesn’t call at work and he told me that Ethan had passed away. I was in absolute shock. I immediately called my best friend, Jennifer, who is the children’s minister at my church, and asked for the details. She told me that he had died sometime between three and four in the morning and that no one knew what had happened. I left work and drove to church to see what I could do to help and spent the rest of the day calling people who knew Ethan to let them know what had happened. Needless to say, that will probably always be one of the most difficult days of my life. Everyone in our church family was shocked and rallied around Tammy and Galen to help them as best we could. The Saturday night after Ethan’s death there was a viewing in the Fellowship Hall at our church. Jennifer’s husband and my husband Brant waited in the over an hour line to talk to Tammy and Galen while we watched Jennifer’s children and then we joined them at the front of the line when our turn came. It was difficult to know what to say. I was also surprised to see that the viewing was open casket, I have always hated that aspect of funerals, but after this one I know that I will never do that if I had the choice. The sight of that little boy laying there is an image that I saw every time I closed my eyes for weeks and is still with me when I think about him today. I think about Ethan everyday. Sometimes I see children that look a little like him  in my job at Disney and I have a hard time not crying. His funeral, while beautiful and   very well led by our pastor, was something that I defiantly never want to experience again, however just this weekend our church lost another child. Jordan was 21 years old and although I am only a few years older than him, I know that he was very much still just a kid. The circumstances that Jordan died under where very different than with Ethan (the car that he was riding in was being driven by a drunk driver who was drag racing, ran a red light and caused a six car accident in which Jordan was ejected from the car and killed instantly). But the pain is very similar. Jordan had two younger sisters and a younger brother, who my husband and I have worked with extensively in our church’s youth and children’s ministry. (His little sister, Shannon, was the flower girl in my wedding less than six months ago.) My husband was at his mother’s house with the family until 2am on the night that the accident occurred, and we have both spent time with Jordan’s siblings and mother in the now just over 48 hours since Jordan died. I am a person of great faith and I believe strongly that both Ethan and Jordan are now in a better place. I know that somehow that knowledge is supposed to bring comfort to those who knew these two boys, but for me it still brings very little. The foundations of my faith, while not altogether laid aside, have defiantly been tested, and I find myself with far more questions than I can answer. Sometimes I feel that I don’t have a right to be as concerned and touched by their deaths as I am, especially when I look at their parents and can only imagine the horrible pain they are feeling, but I know my grief is also real and something that I too must deal with. The anger that I feel towards God, the doctors and nurses who let us down with Ethan (the theory is that he died from an accidental overdose of morphine while in the hospital), and the kid that Jordan was in the car with is enormous. I know that I must let go of this anger and forgive these people to move on, but I am finding that a lot more difficult than I ever imagined. Jordan’s funeral will be this week and when it takes place it will be the second funeral for someone younger than me that I have experienced in just a little more than a month’s time.

        "blog_text": "(*Note to readers* - Cloak and Dagger will now be updated at least once every week...let's say every Thursday.  Content will depend on occurring events, of course.)  The 'jumping job culture' of this profession kind of has me puzzled.  I mean, I do realize and appreciate that the availability and viability of engineering jobs in Alberta is very sensitive to the oil and gas market, but what puzzles me is why the oil and gas industry is not more interested in growing and developing its consulting and vending resources.  The consulting engineering business in Calgary has grow substantially, probably due to the hack and slash of oil company resources more than a decade ago.  Those technical resources, once under the banner of successful oil companies, now found themselves in a position where they were required to offer their services on a contractual basis.  Loyal oil and gas engineers turned to contracting in order to continue their professions.  Unfortunately, they were no longer treated as valued employees and staff.  Being a young engineer in the fray of competition of that business, I soon learned that consulting engineering is often treated by oil and gas companies (as it appears to me) in a  'use and dispose' manner, much like a piece of tissue paper.    This kind of attitude causes these EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) firms to grow and shrink--and grow again--and shrink again...well, you get the idea.  As such, the employees of EPC firms may find themselves hopping from one company to the next in an effort to continue their engineering employment in a fluctuating job market.  In addition, due to the hiring company's lack of understanding of the business, it is typically the lowest bidder winning the contract rather than the firm with the best idea, best plan, or best contract staff.  The new company I am jumping to (on Feb.9) is in an upswing cycle at the moment.  Last year's 3rd and 4th quarter financial reports of this company state that they have a backlog of work, which is not unusual for medium-sized firms at the present time.  Engineering firms around the city, such as the one I'm joining, are scrambling to find seasoned engineers.  (Sidenote: the firm I am leaving is relatively busy, but it has misallocated its staffing resources due to poor business development and planning.  They were not interested in developing their resources such as in process or facilities engineering.  In my opinion, their business strategies need to be changed, and the senior and executive staff must work harder and be more innovative in order to get the business they spoke of targetting a year ago.  They are too complacent, and the staff hiring is experiencing much more nepotism and favouritism.  Don't get me wrong, there are good people, but the overall feel of the company is reflected in one employee's comments to me when I first started: '(This company) is a good place to retire.')  The oil and gas companies have shot themselves in the foot.  With a booming market, they now find themselves in a position of needing experienced consulting services.  What they didn't count on was that a big chunk of the workforce they laid off more than a decade ago (the workforce who today would be senior engineers) have left for greener pastures, either leaving the country for more stable and profitable work, or leaving the profession entirely to pursue a career where they would be treated more fairly.  As such, oil and gas consulting firms are loaded with younger, inexperienced engineers trying to cope with the busy schedules put on them by needy clients.  As a younger engineer I suppose I should see this as a good thing, but speaking as a professional trying to gain experience and knowledge (which is both a personal goal, as well as a requirement of our professional associations), I'm finding it painfully frustrating.  The senior engineers I have worked under are overworked and overloaded, and trying to get their mentoring and advice on a regular basis is almost impossible.  They don't have time to mentor, and they don't want to.  To complicate matters, consulting firms typically have meager budgets dedicated to continuing education, maybe in order to increase profit margins.  And of course like all companies in all industries, consulting firms are expected to do more with less resources.  Now as I join the ranks of intermediate engineers who are always looking for the angle, demanding high wages and company benefits, and always in search of companies that have enough work and treat us fairly, I reflect on my colleagues.  This is the prevalent attitude of intermediate and senior engineers.  Loyalty was not given to us, so we do not return loyalty.  Everyone is out for himself/herself.  And I find that very sad.",

Dreams usualy die when they starve from lack of hope, sometimes they are smothered between slices of reality.  But the most truly saddening is when we must take that dream and kill it ourselves.  When we find ourselves repeating cliches to asuage our guilt at the murder we just preformed... I have recently driven a final stake through the heart of a longtime dream.  When you find yourself killing things that you had held close to the heart, well, you feel as though you've become the ultimate betrayer.  So be it.  The truth is, the cuts scar over, the heart mends and you go on.  But in some instances the future holds nothing of the dream you had, and ghost-like afterimages and half measures to keep out the bitter winds, are better left out.  So it is with this dream, I can not have staked so much of myself, so much of what I am on what turned out to be a pipe-dream.  So, in retrospect, promises of continued friendship where lies.

The moon can not condecend to meet the wolf, and no matter how high our dear wolf climbs he shall never meet the moon.  And so the wolf will cease to cry for his moon.  The dream he held has been killed, and blood drips from the wolf's fangs.  For the truth is seldom pretty and real life is naught but pain.  But the wolf will run and he will cry out in anger and in fear and with pain, but never to the moon again, never.

So I've been thinking about dating and men and love again. I have just one question--do you believe in soulmates? Where the hell is my soulmate? The concept of a soulmate creates my entire demise--it breeds nothing but hesitation on my part and turns me into a gigantic commitment-phobe. (Yeah, sure, I'll date you, you're nice and cute and fun...but chances are 6billion to one that you are not my soulmate so I'll be moving on soon...oh wow, I am really getting to like you BUT WHAT IF THERE IS SOMEONE BETTER OUT THERE? AHHHHH! Go away! Leave me alone! I'm waiting for my soulmate!) Unless you come with a sign on your forehead that says 'Melissa Ferguson's Soulmate' I don't even want to bother.  Then there is the concept of how superficial I am. I base more of my romantic interest in the way someone looks and how big their muscles are, not who they are or what they believe. This has not gotten me far in my life and I have vowed to change it, but this vow is doing little for me. I can' t help but stare at biceps and shoulders and think yummy thoughts. However, there is hope. I thought a short chubby guy was really sexy the other day--it was something about his eyes and his general look--it was very soulful. He could look deep into my soul. (Okay, maybe he couldn't--he knew absolutely nothing about me-- but it felt that way and that is so very sexy). It helps that he was hispanic. I guess the chemistry between people can never be forced. I just know that it absolutely HAS to be there for me above all else and this makes me feel superficial. I wonder to myself, 'Why don't I fall deeply madly in love with the nice guy who rides my bus and who likes to speak Chinese and who plays guitar and who reads Tennyson and loves kids and has a close relationship with his sister?' All the qualifications of the type of person I am looking for but missing that one essential element. Sigh.  Truthfully, I don't believe in soulmates. The idea that out of all the people in the world, I will find my soulmate in Gainesville Florida is highly unlikely. Therefore I must convince myself that there are multitudes of soulmates for every one person on this earth. I have loved many people in many ways. Which way is the right way? I haven't experienced it yet, I suppose. It is unfortunate that I believe that different people can be right for you at different times in your life--I don't think I fall into ranks with people who believe in one lifetime love. I think I am too faint of heart, too weak, too afraid... afraid that no-one could ever love me forever and ever. Maybe I'm afraid that I couldn't love just one person for ever and ever. I'm not entirely sure. Maybe my fear of commitment comes from the fact that I don't want to make the wrong decision (so I won't make any at all). They say nothing ventured, nothing gained. At this moment, I feel sort of desperate, like I am on pause. I hope I'm getting some sort of higher wisdom from this patient waiting experience, because its sometimes boring, often times lonely, and altogether frustrating.   Soulmate Wanted: Must be considerate, supportive, adventurous, wise, friendly, and fun. Must inspire me and make me smile. Must not let me get too bored. Bringing out my creative juices a plus. Making sure I don't lose myself in you is essential. Those without intense chemistry need not apply. Must inspire in me a promise and a will to love you forever.",

        "blog_text": "In-class Assignment for Wednesday - A True Story. Remember the book 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus'? Here's a prime example offered by an English professor from the University of Phoenix: 'Today we will experiment with a new form called the tandem story. The process is simple. Each person will pair off with the person sitting to his or her immediate right. As homework tonight, one of you will write the first paragraph of a short story. You will e-mail your partner that paragraph and send another copy to me. The partner will read the first paragraph and then add another paragraph to the story and send it back also sending another copy to me. The first person will then add a third paragraph, and so on back and forth. Remember to re-read what has been written each time in order to keep the story coherent. There is to be absolutely NO talking outside of the e-mails and anything you wish to say must be written in the e-mail. The story is over when both agree a conclusion has been reached. \n\nThe following was actually turned in by two of my English students: Rebecca, and Gary. \n\nTHE STORY: \nAt first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted. The chamomile, which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings at home, now reminded her too much of Carl, who once said, in happier times, that he liked chamomile. But she felt she must now, at all costs, keep her mind off Carl. His possessiveness was suffocating, and if she thought about him too much her asthma started acting up again. So chamomile was out of the question.\n\nMeanwhile, Advance Sergeant Carl Harris, leader of the attack squadron now in orbit over Skylon 4, had more important things to think about than the neuroses of an air-headed asthmatic bimbo named Laurie with whom he had spent one sweaty night over a year ago. 'A.S. Harris to Geostation 17,' he said into his transgalactic communicator. 'Polar orbit established. No sign of resistance so far...' But before he could sign off a bluish particle beam flashed out of nowhere and blasted a hole through his ship's cargo bay. The jolt from the direct hit sent him flying out of his seat and across the cockpit.\n\nHe bumped his head and died almost immediately, but not before he felt one last pang of regret for psychically brutalizing the one woman who had ever had feelings for him. Soon afterwards, Earth stopped its pointless hostilities towards the peaceful farmers of Skylon 4. 'Congress Passes Law Permanently Abolishing War and Space Travel,' Laurie read in her newspaper one morning. The news simultaneously excited her and bored her. She stared out the window, dreaming of her youth, when the days had passed unhurriedly and carefree, with no newspapers to read, no vision to distract her from her sense of innocent wonder at all the beautiful things around her. 'Why must one lose one's innocence to become a woman?' she pondered wistfully.\n\nLittle did she know, but she had less than 10 seconds to live. Thousands of miles above the city, the Anu'udrian mothership launched the first of its lithium fusion missiles. The dim-witted wimpy peaceniks who pushed the Unilateral Aerospace Disarmament Treaty through the congress had left Earth a defenseless target for the hostile alien empires who were determined to destroy the human race. Within two hours after the passage of the treaty the Anu'udrian ships were on course for Earth, carrying enough firepower to pulverize the entire planet. With no one to stop them, they swiftly initiated their diabolical plan. The lithium fusion missile entered the atmosphere unimpeded. The President, in his top-secret Mobile submarine headquarters on the ocean floor off the coast of Guam, felt the inconceivably massive explosion, which vaporized poor, stupid, Laurie and 85 million other Americans.

Similarly, in high school, whereas most of my classmates would eagerly form a circle around a fight between two testosterone maddened guys having a slug fest, I would walk the other way, sickened not just at the fighting and violence, but at those people who were so anxious to watch and cheer it on.  So I was faced with a dilemma when I checked out the web site  The Memory Hole  after reading about it in the August 2004 issue of Wired magazine.     The Memory Hole claims to be, and indeed apparently is, dedicated to publicizing all sorts of information that our government, the media, corporations, and other entities and individuals likely would not want available for mass consumption.  For example, the site contains a five minute video of President W sitting in front of grade schoolers AFTER he learned on 911 that America was apparently under attack.  Watching it, I was left wondering (1) how could he remain so apparently calm (or oblivious) and (2) why would the Secret Service have permitted him to remain in one arguably soft-target location for so long under such dire circumstances.  But The Memory Hole also contains some graphically disturbing material.  For instance, it contains images of one of the beheaded victims in Iraq--his head posed grotesquely on his back.  The site also claims to have video footage of the beheading.  I did not watch it.  And therein lies the dilemma for Karma Fool.  This is obviously a site that I will return to often, now that I know it exists.  But is it the type of site that I should include on the Karma Fool blog 'Links' list.  Ultimately, I decided to include it.    Why?  Because I think it's an important site for all kinds of reasons.   The violent images on the site are 'hidden' on separate links--and they do not appear to have been placed there gratuitously.  And  I have to admit that sometimes it may be important to take a look at just how cruel some people can be--and not to just read about it.",

Every person I saw came a flood of information about that person.  I'm guessing that it was all my imagination, but I felt as though I could see everyone for real.  Strange indeed.  An old man strolling along with his overloaded walker, full of groceries was walking next to me.  At first, I felt pity, then I noticed he was jamming out with headphones to bob dylan.  A whole wave of thought enveloped me.  He had a smile on his face.  I looked around and I saw a girl holding the hand of another girl and I noticed that she held a poster in her hand and that they were shopping together and were having fun.  I started to look at all the people around me and realized I could tell a lot from just looking at them.  All these people were, when it comes down to it, a lot like me.  I had to just sit down on a wall and watch for a while.  Why haven't I noticed this before?  Maybe I've been a self-centered bastard all my life.  Don't know...  I seemed to be able to make up whole lives around all the people that I saw.  Probably, way too much assuming, but it made all of these people real to me.  Suddenly, I was not alone at all in this world.  I could see the pain, joy, boredom, rage in all these people by casual observation.  I'm still piecing all this together, but I can't explain what a revelation this morning was to me.

        "blog_text": "*Sniffles warning; may need kleenex*  I need to write this out, so forgive me in advance for sounding more emotional than usual.  Mark called lastnight.  He waited in line for nearly an hour at a bank of 40 phones among nearly 5000 others, several in line behind him.  Calls were limited to 10 minutes.  I have this horrible habit of thinking I will remember the things that happen when I stop and think 'I need to tell him about this'.  Then he calls, and my heart sinks, and I cant remember anything I wanted to tell him.  I need to do better writing things down as they happen, I feel like Im being so vague with him saying 'everything here is fine, normal, same-o', and I know thats not what he needs to hear (and at this point, I dont know what he needs from me).  So during our conversation we talked about the sandstorms, how their sunglasses are 'sealed' to their faces to keep sand out, and when they shower theres sand in places you never thought existed.  During a 'normal' sandstorm, he said he can see 10-15 feet in front of him and thats about it.  So the sniffles were explained away as sinus problems from the wind and sand.  He gave me the address he will have in a couple of weeks so that I can start putting together mail and packages.  If any of you want his address, please e-mail me and I will give it to you.  I asked him what kinds of things he wants or needs, and all he said he really wanted are books.  The guys pass them around and it keeps their minds busy.  I thought about picking up some college course type books for them so they can learn about stuff, too.  Other than that, he said 'the usual', including snack packs, brownies and the normal homey type things I sent last time he was there.  Last time, I wrote usually 2 letters a day to him.  I purchased a case of pre-stamped envelopes from the post office and bought a couple of rubber stamp kits and hand numbered all of the envelopes.  This way when he received several at a time, he could put them in order and then read them.  I sent over 300 letters to him during that tour.  Lastnight I wrote my first letter in a long time.  Our conversation ended just past 10pm my time, and I wrote until after 11.  I ended up with 7 pages written by candlelight, and my hand is sore today.  I will have to get back in the groove with using my hand for more than painting and typing.  My heart broke for him when we were saying goodbye on the phone.  I knew something was on his mind, but he didnt share.  Maybe because of the guys standing in line behind him.  But the end of the phone call made me feel so terribly helpless, I cant reach out to him, I cant call him back, and I cant get on a plane to go comfort him.  All I can do is hope that he knows how I feel, and hope hes able to call me again soon so I know hes ok.    Ive known him since 1989.  15 years.  Up until a few years ago, he was the love of my life, but not until recently when we remarried (2001) was it clear to me that hes not just the love of my life, he is absolutely my soul mate.  When were together, we dont even need to talk.  It is never uncomfortable, it is always right.  We have such a peaceful relationship that is so filled with love and devotion, more now than ever before.  Ive watched him grow into such a beautiful and strong man, a loving father, a kind, compassionate soul.  When I hear his voice its like my heart has been jumpstarted.  I miss his physical presence with us, and at the same time I feel him with me every moment of the day.  If you had asked me 15 years ago if I knew what love was, I would have said yes - but my understanding of it then is nothing compared to now.  Now, when I say or think about how much I love my husband, I feel an overwhelming sense of him in my soul, occupying every hidden space in my mind and heart.  Its nearly impossible to explain its so huge.  Bigger than I ever knew it could be.

I’ve seen the movie about 30 times and even bought a DVD player largely so I could watch the movie at home with commentary and deleted scenes because I wanted to understand the movie better. Just like a boy who doesn’t really like to talk – you become obsessed. What are they hiding? What can you unlock? What about the bigger picture of this are you missing? It’s like  Jordan Catalano  syndrome, only I feel like  Donnie Darko  is deeper that my high school crush. And yes, you’ve just entered another  Donnie Darko  related post. A very long one at that.  One of the things that really drew me the most into Monde Donnie Darko was the accompanying music:  Echo and the Bunnymen ’s “The Killing Moon,”  Tears for Fears ’ “Head Over Heels,”  Joy Division ’s “Love Will Tear Us Apart,” Duran Duran ’s “Notorious,”  The Church ’s “Under the Milky Way,” and  Gary Jules ’ version of the  Tears for Fears  song “Mad World,” to name a few.  For the longest time I just thought that these songs were merely put in there to put a time context to the movie and because they were really fucking cool songs. In retrospect, I realize that these songs were actually plot devices serving as clues to what’s going on in the movie and to maybe help the viewer get a better sense of what everything' means. Until  Scott  sent me a link to a  Salon  article  about the movie  I still hadn’t figured things out. So before reading on, I suggest you go to that article.  I warn you, I will be super insane about this, so you might not follow because I’m not sure my thoughts are totally flushed out to the point of making sense.   I saw the directors cut last night (I unfortunately missed the first 4 minutes, which meant that I missed one of my favorite scenes,  which  also means I missed the fact that they changed the song they used in the opening scene. It was no longer 'The Killing Moon' by Echo and the Bunnymen. Now it's INXS' 'Never Tear Us Apart' and apparently the song worked really nicely. I guess I'll go see it again tomorrow so I can see this for myself. Anyway, there are some added comments to this post that I thought about since last night -- and since seeing the directors cut, so i'm putting those notes in red, just like this.     Echo and the Bunnymen – “The Killing Moon”   The movie, I found, nearly appears to be written almost as if the screenwriter had been given an assignment to create a movie based on a song, and that song is “The Killing Moon” by Echo and the Bunnymen. Must I point out the fact that Donnie Darko spends the whole movie following around and listening to the advice of a dude in a bunny costume?  “Under blue moon I saw you”  begins the song. The blue moon represents a rare moment, much like the rare moment when something happens in the universe that causes there to be two universes. A freaky occurrence in space, the world or universe will collapse and destroy itself. Nature killing itself.   “Up in your arms too late to beg you or cancel it though I know it must be the killing time, unwillingly mine”  - Donnie, for the first time (a rare moment a la a blue moon), experiences love but also needs to face the fact that he must destroy and kill everything to save everything. It’s something he doesn’t want to do but needs too, nearly against his will.   ”Fate, up against your will. Through the thick and thin, he will wait until you give yourself to him.”  -- OK, the first part of this line can be interpreted as how Donnie must face his fate as the inevitable and unlikely superhero – a fate nearly all super heroes feel sort of unhappy with. The second part of that line can be used with two reasons: 1. Donnie’s girlfriend Gretchen most likely gives her virginity to Donnie (or at least takes his) and he needs to have that in his life to feel complete and then feel alright and not alone about destroying the parallel universe so he can save the real  one, and 2. Donnie is giving himself to God by following through with what fate had left him with.    ”In starlit nights I saw you. So cruelly you kissed me. Your lips a magic world, your sky all hung with jewels. The killing moon, will come too soon.”  -- What kisses Donnie cruelly under starlit night is the kiss of death for his love, Gretchen. The lips forcing him into a magic, parallel world. The hung part is obviously referencing his ginormous cock.   ”La la la la la...”  -- the nonchalantness Donnie eventually feels about the whole thing when he’s sat in his bed laughing. OK, I’m stretching with that one.   This song doesn't open the film anymore. Instead it's what you hear just after Donnie and Gretchen have sex for the first time. It works pretty well in that scene as well since it's got the whole concept of there being a killing moon and Donnie kills Frank shortly after while they're in the twilight. It also pushes the 'fate up against your will' concept of how Donnie is just doing what fate has called for him to do -- which is DESTROY THE TANGENT UNIVERSE     Joy Division – “Love Will Tear Us Apart”   OK, whatever Donnie is feeling in this movie can be summed up best by this song. His love for Gretchen, his short, yet undying love for her, causes him to destroy everything. It tears them apart because she follows him to the cellar door and gets killed by Frank. It tears them apart because when Donnie is given a second chance to live and repeat everything that went wrong for a chance to be in love with Gretchen again – or maybe not even repeat for definite but face the  chance  of repeating the fate that leads to Gretchen’s death, he chooses to off himself so she might live. At least he got to live a life for a short time when he was in love and knew that someone loved him back. He’d rather die than not feel that again. His love for her, tears them apart. Unlike “The Killing Moon,” it’s about “Love Will Tear Us Apart”’s feeling, rather than the lyrics.     Duran Duran – “Notorious”   Not my favorite Duran Duran song, but I’m assuming the reason it was used was because of this line:   ”No.. no.. notorious! I.. can't read about it, burns the skin from your eyes,  I'll do fine without it, here's one you don't compromise. Lies come hard to disguise, let me to fight it out, not wild about it. Lay your seedy judgements, who says they're part of our lives?”  -- Patrick Swayze’s character , Jim Cunningham, comes to Donnie’s town as a sort of holier than thou self help master whom Donnie calls out for being a fraud and the anti-Christ. Turns out Donnie was right. Cunningham was busy with a child pornography ring when he wasn’t busy trying to convince everyone that he was the second coming. This is discovered when Donnie burns down his house and the fire department finds a secret room filled with the sicko porno tapes. Pretty seedy for such a judgmental person. He was no longer able to disguise his lies, despite Kitty “God is Awesome” Farmer’s attempt to prove his innocence. It’s no mistake that this was played during Sparkle Motion’s performance, and when Donnie was burning down Jim Cunningham’s house. And it was probably also no mistake that Jim’s last name was Cunningham seeing as the word “cunning” means “Marked by or given to artful subtlety and deceptiveness.”     Tears for Fears – “Head Over Heels”   This song is the first song post-galaxy change. “Something happens and I’m head over heels” – that something is, let’s see, when the universe splits into two and Donnie finds himself on bizarroverse. Eventually it’s an action that Donnie commits later on in the movie that causes him to get through the film: He kills Frank. Frank is killed during the 28 day bizarro period and therefore able to exist and walk around as he wishes (as a sort of ghost), advising Donnie on what to do. If Donnie never shot and killed Frank towards the end of the movie he never would’ve been able to destroy the bizarroverse because Frank served as a helper. Anyway, basically this line is pretty impressively used if you’re as crazy as I am and over analyzing lyrics at 9:30 pm on a Friday night “It's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand.”     there's a line at the end of this song that I haven't been able to find on any of the lyrics databases for this song. If I am hearing it correctly, what's being said at the very end of this song is: 'One little boy, one little man. Funny how time flies.' Donnie is a little boy, turned into a little man almost instantly, and in the directors cut of the movie he makes a reference to time flying. He makes time fly.    The Church – “Under the Milky Way”   I don’t know if this movie was the first time I heard this song since it seemed incredibly familiar to me the moment it came on screen. I wish I could remember exactly which part this song came in on since that might make some sort of difference for my purposes. In terms of when it was used in the movie: the song came on just after Donnie and Gretchen had sex for the first and last time (unless he fucked her corpse, you know, for old times). However, the line that works well for this is: “And it's something quite peculiar, something that's shimmering and white. Leads you here despite your destination, under the Milky Way tonight.” You know how Donnie keeps on following those silver orbs? Those are quite peculiar, shimmering, and sort of white. They lead him around despite what he thinks his destination should be – or rather they lead him to what his destination should be. It all happens under the Milky Way – which is out of it’s mind on that particular night.     In the directors cut they had this song playing while Donnie was driving in the car with his father. The song that played post coital changed to 'The Killing Moon'.     Tears for Fears/Gary Jules – “Mad World”   Well, this is the last song we hear in the movie. We hear this song when Donnie finally gets everything back in order (after using his telekinesis powers to rip the engine thing off the wing of the airplane his mom and sister were on and cause a sort of time traveling machine that destroyed the parallel universe he was in – I shit you not, that’s what he did) . No more bizarre universe. No more dead girlfriend. No more dead bunnyman. It’s a crazy world, this world he lives in. This world we live in. And if it weren’t for the martyr by the name of Donnie Darko, we’d be dead.     I forgot to mention that the song contains the incredible line 'I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad, that the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I ever had.' This is one of the most important lines of the song, and I totally forgot to mention it. There are a lot of theories that the entire movie was a prophetic dream of Donnie's, and that all the people in his life had a similar dream. If it was a prophetic dream, and he died in it, and he fell in love, then it'd be easy to say that it was the best he ever had.   Thank you and good night.",

        "blog_text": "Sorry it's been so long since my last post. Last week I was having a period of feeling indifferent and wanted to write about that and it took me a while to let my thoughts tumble around in my head for a while. During that time it seemed like if I were going to write I should write about that and I didn't want to write about it so I wrote nothing at all. It's sort of like when a college student has a book they want to read but doesn't read it because if they have time to read they should be reading for class, but they didn't want to read for class and ended up reading nothing at all. Which is twisted logic. That's why I always felt fine about skipping out on class reading for personal reading.  I've been thinking about how I care about the struggle for social justice, but do I  really  care? There's the question of how much you're willing to give in terms of time and energy. Lately I've been having my doubts.  I know that things change because people make them change. There's no magic secret, just being willing to do the work, and it's such hard work. There are so many frustrating things about it. Last year my sister Annie was co-chair of Willamette Students for Peace and Justice (WSPJ), which I'd led the year before. She'd call me up to complain about things that were driving her crazy--people flaking out on her, clashes of egos, etc. I'd listen to her and just be, like, 'Yep, that's activism.' But it can really wear you down.  Part of my sentiment is probably just the lingering bad taste in my mouth from the whole SEIU thing. I mean you go and say, 'Sure I'll work twelve hour days, live out of a hotel room, and go wherever you send me.' You're willing to do all that and then they say, 'Nah, we don't want you. Go away.'  I almost feel like I'm hearing 'Nah, we don't want you. Go away.' on a more general level, like that's what so many of the people being screwed by the system say to movements. I understand that there are many reasons for this, not the least of which is the ways in which we alienate people, but it's still hard is when the people with whom you want to work in solidarity don't seem receptive.   I know the answer is to be persistent and try harder, but sometimes it feels like you just want to give up. Sometimes I ask myself why bother standing up for people who won't bother to stand up for themselves. I have moments where I feel like if oppressed people want things to change, it's up to them to fight for it, I'm not going to stand in their way, but I'm not going to do it for them. That touches on a basic truth of social struggle, which is that people have to liberate themselves. So maybe I'll just watch and cheer from the sidelines.  I used to never be able to understand the people who agreed with me in principle but weren't willing to  do  anything, the whole 'we're down with you man, but we won't be going to the meeting' deal. But lately I've been identifying. You see an injustice, recognize it as such, and realize you could do things that might address it--but there are other things that are more important to you. You're privileged and you know it's not fair, but you might as well enjoy it--life's short and what does it really matter in the end.  It's funny that California is in some ways worse for my cynicism than DC, but I think part of that is because I'm isolated instead of being in constant contact with inspiring, energetic, committed people (the other is that suburbs are evil). It's hard to have the strength to keep plugging along all by yourself, maybe even impossible. That's why it's so important to organize networks.  I know it's not that I don't care. It's probably just the result of caring too much and having that overload my circuits and make me go numb. Caring is reflexive for me. My mom's in Wall Mart filling my grandma's prescription and wants to buy a CD and some pencils for me. No. It comes without having to think about it. I won't shop there. I know they have the lowest prices and times are tight for a lot of people. I don't hold it against them, but things aren't tight enough for me to make whatever money I save be worth supporting everything they stand for. Perhaps resistance is futile, but not resisting is even more so.   That's what it always comes down to for me. I was having a beer and papusas with some Colombian trade unionists a little over a year ago, while discussing the topic of social change. 'Hacemos lo que podemos,' I said (We do what we can). 'Y no podemos hacer mas,' he repliced (And we can do no more).",

        "blog_text": "Well, I am here now, at work.  It’s Monday.  It is raining outside.  Dreary day, and I am already more than ready to go home or crawl under my desk and take a nap.  This morning saw me leaving for work late, with Cara crying that she did not want me to go.  Then, I walked into the 18th floor kitchen, and the cover of the Time Magazine caught my eye - a mother with a small, happy child and the title, “The Case for Staying Home” across the bottom of the picture. I gritted my teeth and fought the urge to put a post-it on the Magazine with something like, “fuck you” written in bold, red letters.  If I had the option, I sure as hell would not be here.  In a way, I was offended that someone would so tactlessly put that in here.  I thought specifically of Valerie, who sits next to me, and just returned from maternity leave.  She is just learning the meaning of mommy guilt, as she tears herself away from her new baby girl every morning.  Every 2-4 hours, she finds an empty conference room or office where she can use her breast pump.  There is the secretary on the 19th floor who is due any day now and walks through the hall with her hand always protectively over her belly.  Cara, my 4 year old, is so disturbed that I now work full time that she worries in her sleep and wakes up repeatedly.  We  take ourselves to court daily, building a case to come here.  This is not a career.  This is not where we find purpose and meaning.  This is our sentence.  This is survival.  Outside, it is still raining.    ***** 3/30/04 It’s probably not a good thing when the contents of the bottles under your kitchen sink are of more interest to you - as possible ingredients for a mixed drink – than those in the liquor cabinet.  When, while filling up the bathtub with water, the thought, “This could be my grave…” flitters across your brain.  An end.  An end to all that your future promises to be.  Suicide, that terrible word, become a tantalizing idea, but not something you could actually ever go through with, not with a clear conscience.  And who can face death, truly face it, with a burdened conscience.  As much as you think that everyone else really would be better off… (and honestly, they could very well be) you know that deep inside it does not matter.  The trauma of your exit, their release, would outweigh the benefits. So, suicide, the idea of it, the impossibility of it, entertains and somehow relieves some of the pressure built up inside.    Driving to and from work every day, at every turn and intersection, you wonder, “Could this be it?”  Always partially cocked, ready for the 18 Wheeler to come barreling into the driver’s side of your car; for the idiot in front of you to suddenly slam on his breaks, while going 70 miles an hour, so you can’t stop soon enough, and your head smashes though the windshield; for someone to back up in the parking lot, not looking, while you walk unsuspectingly behind their car with your arms full of groceries.  Yet, even there, death is not a certainty, otherwise more of us would step dazedly into traffic the next time we had the urge. If an end was guaranteed. If you could save everyone else from you, what wouldn’t you do?  Your kidding yourself, though, if you think your motives purely unselfish.  “I’m doing this for them,” to help them by removing yourself…bullshit.  The truth is, though that may in fact play a significant role in motivation (and again, it may be an accurate deduction); the truth is, you look ahead into a future filled with every day of this feeling, of no real hope of happiness or color to life, and you want to die – would rather die – than have to live another day like this.  There is no hope that it might get better, that “the skies may turn blue again” – even if you know (if you were really honest with yourself) that the possibility exists.  Right here, right now, the tunnel doesn’t have an end and there is no light to head towards.  There is no objectivity in despair.  It looks at logic, unflinchingly.  It faces reality, directly, and says, “ I don’t fucking care how this could get better or what might change in the future. This is now, I am here, and I am buried alive.”",

        "blog_text": "her grandmother   mary. half italian, half czech. gorgeous. her husband died twenty-seven years ago. she never remarried, she never even glanced at anyone else. she loved, and without doubt, she was lonely. she never cried, not that anyone ever saw.  she adapted to a life with her eldest daughter, an overweight diabetic agoraphobic of nearly four decades, accepted the routine and comforts of widow and spinster, a life of cleaning and cooking and sneaking cigarettes in the basement, sneaking off to the convenience store, and sneaking off for just a little fun.  she favored her one and only granddaughter. it was only natural. she was the youngest, and the one in closest proximity. she'd take her to lunch at the local restaurants, to beauty salons while she'd have her hair done, to the shops over town, where she'd buy little trinkets--crayons, coloring books, puzzles--to keep on hand for any whim that might strike.  she'd take her granddaughter to bingo, sometimes three nights a week: thursdays at st. paul's, saturdays at st. ann's, and sundays at st. mike's. sometimes, she'd pack up books and crayons and tapes and a walkman to keep her granddaughter occupied while she'd smoke and play her vast array of cards. as a child, she'd been blinded in one eye by a boy with good aim who'd disguised a chunk of brick in a snowball; her family was poor and without insurance, so the eye became infected, and eventually, useless. but she always knew how many numbers she needed before she had the four corners, or the letter 'h', or cover-all.  she could never get her driver's license, because of her poor eyesight, so they walked everywhere, or they'd take the community bus, which only had two stops--the local jamesway shops plaza a town away, and the local swimming pool, and only the shops plaza in the winter when the pool was closed. they'd wander around the shops together, more often than not returning home with some sort of small fish, or a hamster or gerbil, merely to aggravate her daughter and her mother.  she'd teach her to knit, to weave carpets and placemats, to create festive ornaments, to cook pasta, to write on the driveway with chunks of coal. for years, she'd point at the splotch of blue paint on the porch banister and laugh about the day her granddaughter had spilled it.  a few years later, her granddaughter dropped a brand-new gallon of milk on the kitchen floor, and panicked, called her grandmother asking how to clean up the ocean of white fluid covering the wooden floor. she was out of paper towels, out of dish towels, and moving on to toilet paper when she showed up at the door, having walked the two blocks to help as quickly as she could, armed with as many paper towels and rags as she could carry, and together they mopped and scrubbed for hours so that her daughter and her mother never knew.  when her granddaughter went away to college, she knitted her a heavy blanket in school colors to keep her warm. one summer, before classes started, she visited campus--a three-hour drive for someone with stiff legs and a small bladder--and marveled at the size, the enormity, and patted the statue lion's head and smiled for a photo that to this day sits prominently displayed on her granddaughter's dresser.  later that year, after the campus visit, in the middle of the night she had a stroke that suddenly made obvious the need for open-heart surgery, a triple-bypass, and during the surgery a stray blood clot extracted itself from her heart and moved to her eye--her good eye--and left that one, too, almost completely blind. for a time, she was ill, and immobile and lifeless and her granddaughter couldn't stand coming to visit, she couldn't stand how things had changed, how different she was--she hadn't yet realized that things would never be the same.  family holidays, once held at her home, were no longer. the family fragmented, each with its own celebration, hardly ever all crossing paths and reuniting, not even once a year, not anymore.   two years went by, and she got better, little by little. she started sneaking cigarettes again, sneaking off to the convenience store again -- mostly blind but familiar enough with the sidewalks and the streets and the intersections to make it home and back ok, at least in the good weather. but there was no more fun, at least not much of it; no more bingo, no more knitting, no more watching tv, no more reading the newspaper, no more simple pleasures.  at some point in time, her mind gets tired, and things start to become less and less focused.  she's diagnosed with alzheimers.  she stagnates, some days good, some days better, sometimes asking three times in an hour what day it is, then wondering if she should clean the kitchen again.  sometime during the second half of super bowl xxxviii, her live-in daughter, the diabetic agoraphobic, falls seriously ill. she's hospitalized. her heart is failing, her kidneys are failing. her legs will need to be amputated. she's placed in a mental ward after swearing of seeing visitors who could never have come.  she's lost her husband, now she's losing one of her daughters.  tonight, this very night, comes word that her daughter will never leave the hospital again. she'll need assistance to walk, after the amputation, and constant attention. the grandmother can stay alone at home for a few days, but not a lifetime; she's ill, and she forgets, and she can hurt herself. the house will need to be sold, a home will need to be found. changes will have to be made.   tonight, this very night, her granddaughter will sit awake, heart heavy and sobbing, wishing for a redo, not to change things, not to fix things, but to relive it all: the bus rides, the fish, the bingo nights, the holidays, the hugs, the whole of it; not just for herself, for her own mother, who is broken and lost in the face of losing her mother, piece by piece by piece.  her granddaughter sits awake, crying for the beauty and the strength and the caring and the love and the luster and the  life  and the glory that oozed from her grandmother's every action, that now, slowly, without fail or remorse or pity or even the slightest shred of dignity, dutifully fades, and the only thing known is the fear of the end, when there is nothing at all left.",

I'm crying for my mother, who is devastated, and for the beauty and strength that my grandmother gave us.

        "blog_text": "Well not quite, but almost. I was listening to my Maroon 5 album (fantastic band, if you haven't heard of them, find out about them now!) and a track called 'she will be loved' came on. It was one that pulled on me, because it's about someone who has never been by themselves...'she's always belonged to someone else'. I think that's where I've gone wrong. The only time I have been single since I was 15 was for a few months when I was 22/23, and y'know, that says a lot. I bounce from one relationship to another hoping to accidentally stumble across the right one. So when I listen to this song, I'm thinking - she's lucky. At least she's got someone who feels like that!  I kind of make do with what's there at the time instead of aiming a bit higher. I think a lot of people do, and it's sad, but it's like my addiction to sugar. When I was a kid I used to break open the jar with the sugar in it and just eat spoonfuls of it. I remember being in a cafe beside the beach where I used to live, and eating a bowl of sugar cubes that was on the table. Now I've moved on to not being quite so blunt (honest?) about it by piling it into coffee, tea, having chocolate etc. So I'm getting a bit classier with my sugar, so why not my men?  I was writing a personal ad in my head yesterday (I was very bored at work) and I realised that if I actually wrote down my ideal man, I would realise he doesn't exist. I don't know if I've been 'making do' because I genuinely think I can find someone like him given time, or what. I do have this mentality of something better will always come along, but it never is better. I want to be in a situation where I don't *want* anything better. I hope that makes sense. I want to be with someone that I'm wrapped up in, that when I'm with him we're the only two people on earth, I want to pine for him when he's away from me, not be glad for the break!  I've been in a few relationships now. I'm a serial monogamist, and I throw myself entirely into it in the beginning until it starts to go downhill in one way or another. Now please bear in mind that I would give Mr Right my soul (not that he would ask for it) but that's how I am with people I love. So if I go over my big 4, I hope you see that it's not all been my fault. I hope it hasn't anyway. The first one was when I was a teenager and at university and I had my own place. The guy moved in without me noticing. You know...one night here, a t-shirt there...suddenly he was a fixture. He was a student too, and did nothing except play computer games. I was studying for a (hefty) degree and working too, and I'd come home after maybe a 16 hour day to find the place in exactly the same state I left it, although he had the day off, because he hadn't moved from the sofa. Literally. It wouldn't surprise me if he had a glass beside him that he was pissing in to save having to get up for that. Plus he didn't contribute anything to our cost of living. So that was one down, although it took me about a year to get the guts to properly cut him off. Number two got me pregnant within 4 months when I was 20 and then proceeded to abuse me mentally and physically, threaten my friends, my family, and our daughter, and forced me to give up my degree course and all my plans for my life. I remember when I was 7 months pregnant he held me down and stuffed packet after packet of paracetamol in my mouth because I found out he had been cheating on me. His big thing was that his wife had cheated on him - he played on that a *lot* - so for him to be caught out as a cheat was a pretty bad prospect for him and he would have rather have created a fake suicide and killed me and the baby. Luckily (kind of) for me, my body was used to me chucking all sorts of (prescription) things at it, so I threw up, my liver processed the rest, and I got merrily on my way. I have left the city I grew up in, with daughter in tow, because of him, and I will forever be ex-directory and will never register on the electoral roll to eliminate the more obvious ways he could find me. So that wasn't one of the better ones. Number three was going through a divorce with 2 kids and was highly traumatised by it. He was the closest I've ever got to my ideal man, and I absolutely worshipped him, but he wasn't ready for anything. So for my own sake I had to cut that one off. It never really got past the initial fairly casual stages anyway. He still plays on my mind, but I know it would never have worked out. He did help clarify some of what I would be looking for though, so that's a good thing. Number 4 I met through work and I am with just now, and he's bleeding me dry. I pay for everything here, and I don't earn that much. He has a crappy job but plenty of experience to get a much higher paid one, but I think he's just lazy and wouldn't want the responsibility that would come with it. We had agreed on a monthly payment from him to me, but there's constant excuses for why he can't stump it up. So at the moment, I am £4k in debt (£3k more than this time last year) and it's growing steadily. He's a good bloke, don't get me wrong. I don't think he'd ever be unfaithful, but I think that would be more because of the hassle of trying to keep it quiet. He doesn't have a clue why I would want to 1) get a better job 2) move cities to get a better job if necessary 3) possibly complete my degree and change career totally 4) ever have more children 5) ever have sex, for that point. I think my not-so-grand canyon will dry up at this rate. But my daughter likes him, and although I know I could do better (here we go!) I also know I can do much, much worse, because I have. I think my biggest issue is that I can't have a conversation with him. He hasn't read a book since he was at school, and I read ALL THE TIME. He has no interest in anything religious or spiritual, and I'm very curious about it. If I mentioned Beethoven, he'd think I meant the dog. If I try and explain anything to him about anything, he just goes along the lines of 'yeah, whatever'. So it's frustrating, in more ways than one. I feel a sugar headache coming on so I better go and top myself up a bit, and stop frickin whinging! I don't want you to think I'm a moany bitch (although I can be). I might bless you with my 'perfect man' list once I've had my obligatory hot sugar water with a dash of caffeine.  Nessie x",

        "blog_text": "I've always been the kid that no one realizes is even there. I've had this ability to disappear since I was a small child. I don't know quite how or when I developed it, but people always used to say things like 'I didn't even realize you were there.' or 'you're so quiet, I almost forgot you were here.' I had a loud, noisy, little brother that had ADD. He got in trouble so much, it seemed that not even one day could go by without him being the focus of some conversation or argument my parents had. His teachers would always call home. When he was in third grade he started staying out well past midnight and my parents would freak out. He'd come home around midnight or one in the morning and act like everything was fine, that he just lost track of time. At this point I went into hiding. I was in sixth grade. I'd stay in my room for hours listening to my radio, tapes and records I owned, usually acting out on my own. I started stealing, shoplifting from the grocery store. I stole cigarettes and started smoking. They weren't locked up back then, and were right near the exit. I used to cut myself a lot. I liked to watch myself bleed. It wasn't really for the same reasons you usually read about. It wasn't taking away any pain, I wasn't really using it as a release for anything other than, it made me feel real. It made me feel like I existed. I never cut my arms or legs. I'd usually just cut my palms or the bottom of my feet. Places that scars don't really form because the skin renews faster there. I'd stick myself with needles or use an exacto knife. It would be tiny cuts but deep enough for drops and sometimes streams of dark red blood. I liked the way it looked running down my skin. I'd clean myself up, put on a bandaid and then go back to doing what all 11 year old girls do. Talk on the phone. Read my stupid girl books like 'the babysitters club', Think about the boy I liked, which at the time was a boy named Andrew Jensen or Brendan Rector whom I used to spend every summer day with swimming in his pool. I didn't tell anyone about my crushes or my cutting. I guess sometimes secretly I wished I'd just bleed to death. Then I'd never have to hear my parents fight or worry about my brother and even worse I thought that if I did, they'd all really miss me. I used to wonder who'd come to my funeral, who would find me. Stuff like that. I've always been a 'dark' kind of kid I guess. But I'd always think it would be the stupidest thing ever to do because then I'd be dead and it wouldn't really matter. I wasn't a complete idiot. I just never got the attention I wanted. \n\nA few years before all of that started I was eight years old. I had long brown hair down to my lower back, big brown eyes with enormously long black eye lashes. I was skinny and tan and used to run around in my bathing suit all summer long. I'd roller skate in my short jean mini-skirt that was SO popular then. It was the summer of 1987. My cousins boyfriend lived in the same neighborhood as I did. He was sixteen. He wasn't particularly cute or anything but he was a pervert. He used to chase us kids around and then one day I was walking down this path that all of us kids used to play on and he came up to me and said I had pretty eyes. I just kind of looked at him like he was stupid. I was eight. I just wanted to play with my toys, except I knew I wasn't going to be able to. I knew something wasn't right. The horrible part is that I knew and I didn't do anything. I was like a deer in headlights. I froze. Everything we had just been shown in school to run, to tell someone you trust if someone does something to you inappropriately seemed to not fit into this equation. I stood there just staring at him while he said that I was always making him hard by running around in my bathing suit. He said I was sexy and then proceeded to shove his tongue down my throat. I nearly gagged. I thought it was so gross, but I couldn't move. I just kept thinking, this is so gross I never want to kiss anyone like this EVER! And then he tried to grab me in other areas and I pushed him off of me and glared at him. Every day after that I'd purposely roller skate on by him in my bathing suit and smile at him with this look of hatred on my face. He kept his distance from then on. I hated him, and I also told myself I'd never let any stupid boy do anything to me that I didn't want. I never told anyone though. I'd just think about it at night. Then I'd think about this boy I used to like, that I'd play with at recess... \n\nYears went on. 7th and 8th grade rolled around. I stopped cutting, started smoking more, cutting class, failing classes, but I never got in trouble. Nothing I could do was wrong in my parents eyes. I was never AS BAD as my brother. I got away with murder. This worked to my advantage the older I got. High School was a blur. I was a late bloomer, small and too skinny, but mildly popular. Summer nights were the best though. One of my best friends Ericka and I would stay up late, wearing bikinis and short jean shorts riding our bikes downtown in the middle of the night. rolling joints, drinking whatever we could steal from our parents house, being dumb. Then I met Beth. I met her my junior year of high school and we became instant best friends. Beth and I were trouble from the beginning. We did everything together and got into plenty of trouble for it too. She would always try to hang out at my house because I had the cool young parents that trusted me and let me go out whenever without a curfew. Her mom was the exact opposite. I'd stay at her house and we'd have to sneak out. We'd call this guy George who was MUCH OLDER than us to come pick us up and take us out. We'd go out. We'd drink and use him for his money and his car and then we'd make him take us back home. He liked Beth a lot, and she knew this and we used him. It was mean, but there was no way in hell she was ever going to be attracted to him. Not like that. His family owned this little french pastry shop in our neighborhood. Beth and I started to become master thieves. We'd blatantly steal shit from stores left and right. The more obnoxious and obvious you were the more you could get away with. It was fun to test the limits of places. I got an entire new wardrobe in a month! STILL my parents never even asked where I got the clothes from, or where I was, or anything. We got arrested though after about sixth months of massive shoplifting sprees. We'd joke about it all the time. Thankfully we got caught with just one shirt between the two of us. If they ever caught us on a good day we'd probably be thrown in jail for grand theft! I remember sitting in my room with her adding up all the price tags and on more than one occasion I'd have over two thousand dollars worth of merchandise just sitting in a pile on my bedroom floor, and all that not including what she took. I was a bad kid. I just couldn't get in trouble though, and the rush was amazing. We got a job working at a water park for the summer that year. We got interviewed together and worked together and then one day she disappeared. I ran into her a few years later and she became my drug buddy. I didn't become a junkie or anything but I started doing more drugs than just pot. I remember being extremely high one night and thinking out loud that it was poly-drug use. I was on MULTIPLE DRUGS. Saying it all slow like and laughing. God I had fun. It went on for years, and then she disappeared again. I think of her often. I hope she is okay.\n\nCollege I got more normal until I dropped out... and now I'm just somewhere floating in between being the saddest girl in the world who feels like she doesn't even really exist and feeling like the luckiest person because I didn't turn out all sorts of fucked up. I have my own problems and issues and each day is its own day filled with highs and lows. Today wasn't a very high one though. I know I have attention problems. I crave it. Not all the time, but sometimes, a little and lately I don't have it and I want it. I also feel like there is nothing left here for me. I often ask myself what kind of changes I need to do or make to help me feel alive again, so I'm not just stumbling along from one day to the next but either the answers are alluding me or I just am refusing to see or acknowledge them. I'm wondering if I want to stay here, if I want to sign another year lease, if I want to find a shorter 6 month lease when I move. Do I want to stay in this city? All sorts of questions keep coming up and I wish I had the answers. I get scared though. I always feel that any ideas I have or things I say are permanent that I can't change my mind and take them back. Like that is what I will be held to forever. I am so weird.",

        "blog_text": "By Francie Baltazar-Schwartz \nJerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, 'If I were any better, I would be twins!' \nHe was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. \nIf an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation. \nSeeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up to Jerry and asked him, 'I don't get it! You can't be a positive person all of the time. How do you do it?' \nJerry replied, 'Each morning I wake up and say to myself, Jerry, you have two choices today. You can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood.' I choose to be in a good mood. Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or I can choose to learn from it. I choose to learn from it. \nEvery time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose to accept their complaining or I can point out the positive side of life. I choose the positive side of life.' \n'Yeah, right, it's not that easy,' I protested. 'Yes it is,' Jerry said. 'Life is all about choices. When you cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice. You choose how you react to situations. You choose how people will affect your mood. You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood. The bottom line: It's your choice how you live life.' \nI reflected on what Jerry said. Soon thereafter, I left the restaurant industry to start my own business. We lost touch, but often thought about him when I made a choice about life instead of reacting to it. \nSeveral years later, I heard that Jerry did something you are never supposed to do in a restaurant business: he left the back door open one morning and was held up at gunpoint by three armed robbers. While trying to open the safe, his hand, shaking from nervousness, slipped off the combination. The robbers panicked and shot him. Luckily, Jerry was found relatively quickly and rushed to the local trauma center. After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Jerry was released from the hospital with fragments of the bullets still in his body. \nI saw Jerry about six months after the accident. When I asked him how he was, he replied, 'If I were any better, I'd be twins. Wanna see my scars?' \nI declined to see his wounds, but did ask him what had gone through his mind as the robbery took place. \n'The first thing that went through my mind was that I should have locked the back door,' Jerry replied. 'Then, as I lay on the floor, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live, or I could choose to die. I chose to live. \n'Weren't you scared? Did you lose consciousness?' I asked. \nJerry continued, 'The paramedics were great. They kept telling me I was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the emergency room and I saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got really scared.. \nIn their eyes, I read, 'He's a dead man. ' I knew I needed to take action.' \n'What did you do?' I asked. \n'Well, there was a big, burly nurse shouting questions at me,' said Jerry. 'She asked if I was allergic to anything. 'Yes,' I replied. The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply. I took a deep breath and yelled, 'Bullets!' \nOver their laughter, I told them, 'I am choosing to live.

        "blog_text": "my beloved whitney writes...     Death's Kiss (#1)  2/4/2004      I spent all day contemplating my life. During fourth period, I sat with Gumby but I was practically mute with depression. An hour and a half she talked and I half listened while thinking of how I wanted to do it. Upon all the cues that called for input I would throw short sentences at her, or questions that I knew would require a detailed answer on her part so that I would not have to speak again soon. From about 1 pm until 4 pm I spent my time at school planning.     I am going to wear my black dress. The one everyone tells me I look like a doll in. The black dress that once made me look awfully thin and graceful. The one with the pink at the bottom is the one I will wear.  I will put hot water in the bathtub. I will sit down in the tub. I will press the razor blade deep into my flesh, deeper than I have ever cut. I will draw that blade up my arm. Then, I will do the same to my other wrist. I will lay down in the hot water of my bathtub, in my gorgeous black, designer dress and wait until I am gone.     That was to take place after school. My mother would be watching TV in the living room and typing away at her computer. My father would be working. My brother would be studying or getting drunk. I would be dying in the bathtub all dressed up…  I got to my front door. My mind was numb along with my fingertips. I got inside. My mom was there and she asked, “Ready to go to therapy?” I had completely forgotten about that! Oh, I did not want to go at all. I would have to drag myself through therapy. I got online. I guess I was in search of a goodbye. It felt as though I was just doing things, not thinking. I was not even able to find motivations for my actions. A bit after 4:35 pm we left to see Dana.      The last thing I need is to talk about my problems and get all emotional in front of people. I do not want to have to say ‘fine’ when she asks me how I am. I do not want to have to lie. I do not want to have to tell Dana why I am NOT fine when I answer ‘depressed’. I do not want questioning. I do not want to the telling that I am irrational or ‘in a state of depression that will soon pass if it is worked on’. I just want to escape and sleep. Leave me alone.     The car ride was a mess of tear triggers and soft, broken singing. My mom tried to talk to me but I wanted to listen to the music and think. I noticed my legs being tense. I tried to relax. Minutes later, I found them in the previous condition again: tight and tense. I began crying for no reason. I was on edge. I needed to go back home. I needed to do what I had planned. I wiped away my silent, unforgiving tears and got out of the car when we arrived. We went inside and Dana popped out from her office, “I’m running late. I’m sorry… 10 minutes?” Just want I need, to be stuck here forever. I was bitter and angry… but inside I was deeply in sorrow. Dana called my mom in 10 minutes later and asked me to wait for a bit. “I can’t come?” I asked anxiously. She told me she would like to check in with my mom for a little just to see my mom’s opinion on my therapy. I sat alone. I began to cry again. Twenty minutes later, my mom came back and I wandered reluctantly into Dana’s office.     Kissing Death (#2)  2/4/2004      She said, “How are you?”  “Fine, thanks. You?”  “Good. Your mom said you seemed upset on the way over.”  “Oh?”  “Yes. Was it over the test you took today?”  “Maybe. I think I failed.”  “Why would you think that? Did you study?” ”That’s just it. I studied my ass off. I worked so bloody hard and I still didn’t succeed. It isn’t supposed to work like that.”  “Sometimes things do. I’m very sorry it happened that way, but why do you think you failed?”     We continued to talk. Eventually we started to talk about something that actually interested me. I got very passionate about what we were discussing. She even challenged me with new ideas. I began to think: Dana is a smart person. She has made me think about many things I never considered. I started to forget about my sadness, depression, and anger. As we finished talking, she laughed and said, “I like you. You have a lot of strongly represented arguments and thoughts. You are so logical and informed. It is nice to see a young person who seeks information under stress and confusion rather than drugs. A conversation with you is like having a ride on a shooting star. You made me learn a lot today, Whitney.” I was so flattered. Someone appreciated me. Someone took the time to listen to me. I was strangely satisfied. I had an urge to go off and meet tons of new people… I wanted to seek out new opinions and find a new fascination.      On the car ride home I thought to myself, I’m okay.  I could not make sense of what caused the sudden feeling of content that came with the love I felt like I had received. How did a conversation about something I took deep interest in make me want to continue? Utter confusion. Yet, it worked. I had a need to fulfill before I could give up and rest.     I do not know if it is temporary satisfaction. I do not know when my suicidal depression will return, but I think that for now at least, I am going to be able to enjoy life a bit more. I write this entry as a reminder of the past. As a reminder of the little things that people can do to give someone a little hope. As a reminder of the idea that things can get better. As an entry of desperation overcome.      Thus, I sign this entry with a kiss.  kiss",

This afternoon. Well, I guess it started yesterday. I sent Matt an MSN message yesterday asking if he was free one night this week b/c I hate how we left things and I'd like to talk. He sent one back saying he'd let me know, but that work is crazy this week for him.  It's bad enough that I messaged him at all, but could I leave it at that? NO!!  Today I messaged him, and he didn't write back.  Then, I messaged again later. He said that he had been away from his desk all day, and still doesn't know about getting together. I, being pissed off (and certifyably crazy), write back 'If you want to just say 'no', then do it' to which replied that he'll really be working late, and doesn't know. Actually, he told me that his boss is sick (has been for a while) and he was leaving to drive him home, and that he really will be working late every night this week, and that he doesn't have time for this right now. He said he'd try to MSN me tomorrow. I'm so embarrassed. I'm so embarrassed. I hate it, and I cant believe Ive become this person.  Where is the 'oh well, whatever, Im fabulous' Heather that I used to be? Shes been replaced with this mopey, pathetic girl who lives in her bathrobe feeling sick to her stomach all day.    So, resolution: no matter how much I want to, no matter how bad I feel, I WILL NOT CALL OR EMAIL OR MESSAGE HIM.  Nothing good can come of it.  If he was even thinking a little that the breakup was a mistake, he certainly isnt now.  And besides that, its really not healthy for me.  Its not healthy for me to be hoping for things to turn around with this. I need to accept that its over and move on.... how the hell do I begin to do that? The only other time I was broken up with was when I was 19, and I got over it by going out with someone else (I call it Serial-Dating).  I really dont feel like dating anyone else this time.   I remember when I broke up with Dave and he just wouldnt let it go, and I hated him for it.  I pitied and hated him.  I really dont want to be that person. I dont want Matt to hate me, and I certainly dont want him to pity me.  Hes been my best friend for so long that the thought of him thinking badly of me rips me up inside. Id give anything to be even half of the independence-addicted Heather that I once was--the Heather who would be ecstatic to be single again, and who could come up with a zillion reasons why I could do better than him.    How the hell do I get back to that?  I hurt so bad. Im going to listen to Gloria Gaynors 'I Will Survive' on repeat. Cliche? Perhaps, but whatever.

I used to tell a story to people all the time hoping that it might help them in the walk of life. In my head, it made sense and had a wonderful point. See, I believe, everyone is born with certain devils in their lives. Bad things that have just 'always been there.' Things that you have always done. Whether it's a personality flaw. Whether it's a prideful thought. Whether it is something blatantly obvious or something hidden deep down inside. Whatever these 'devils' are...everyone has them. And it's everyone's job to discover them and rid their lives of them. That was the big line I used. Makes ya think. Well, it might have made you think. But, you know....it never really made me think. Nope. I just continued on feeling like I 'helped' someone. Feeling like I just did good. Good job Anthony, you saved someone. Moron. How can someone who analyzes everything about life be so blind and stupid to miss this big thing? This great gigantic 2 by 4 sticking out of your eye? How did you miss that? How did you not realize what you were doing? And then the worst part is....you rant and rave about some sort of respect or love or pat on the back that you think you deserve? I am not entitled to anything. I am not entitled to love, friendships, or anything else that I have in my life. I don't deserve these things that I am getting. And I definitely don't deserve the things I am not getting. I don't even deserve to have you guys read these letters each time something pops into my head. Yet, for almost 22 years of my life I lived everyday thinking I do. Expecting my 'time' to come. Expecting everyone to realize how 'great' of a person I am. I am not great. I am not even good. Being good is not doing everything in your power to control the thoughts and actions of your peers. Being good is not even an action. Being good....is smiling and giving me a hug even though I do things that disgust you. Being good is listening to me whine about my life on the phone, knowing the true problem lies within myself and yet saying nothing because you know now is not the time. Being good is getting the courage to tell me the truth when it is the right time. Hell, that's not just being good....that's what is great. That is what separates the people who think they are special from the people that truly are in this world. I have a confession to make. For a long time I thought I was special. I thought I was sent here for you guys. To help you. To be here for you. To be your friend. But, today....I realized.....It was you guys that were sent here for me. You guys are the special ones. I am just a normal guy with just as many 'devils' as the next person. I guess it's time to start eating my words and finding out what those devils are. Thank you. Love you guys Anthony",

        "blog_text": "But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.' Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.  2 Cor 12:9,10  What is cool, and humbling, is when God gets me to read a passage like the one for tonight - and I am thinking, yeah, yeah, I get that, profound, and then my mind starts drifting and I start thinking about other things, and I start getting all worked up about something - and there is a mental tap on the shoulder, a break, a halt, and suddenly the verse I just read comes back into my mind and I realise I have no idea, no understanding, no concept, no heart that matches that verse - that I really do not understand or know what the verse means cos I am not living it.  It happened just then - I was getting annoyed about a mate who I have been humble around, I have let my guard down and they know alot about me - possibly even more than I want them too - and they have seemed to be arrogantly presuming now to tell me of my faults, to question what I do  - and I was just getting a bit angry about it, thinking, well look at Paul he got upset when the Corinthians took his humility and then ran him down and wrote him off, took advantage of the fact that Paul was humble around them to consider him as nothing.  But that is not what Paul is on about - quite the contrary - he has a true humility [I think, and yeah it is true, when I look at my humility I didn't really mean it, it was just an act, and I was not truely humble but proudly pretending to be humble] a humility that will boast in it's weaknesses cos the weakness comes from a heart that is focused on God, focused on giving all in service to God in service to others. A humility that does not claim position, because that position is due them so there is no need to claim it, a position that comes from God.  A humility that recognises that when I am as an individual are weak, that is a good thing because then I am strong in my reliance on God and His power and that is true strength.  Instead I had a humility that wasn't, and when the person accepted that I was humble and treated me as a humble person, I, not being humble at all, but just pretending, got very upset. Who are they to judge me I thought, why should I be humble to you, if it just makes you proud - but of course I was the proud one, the arrogant one.  On another topic - I think it is extremely ironic that the two books of Corinthians are used by the charismatic churches to promote their emphasis on Spiritual gifts and the exercise of them and the way God's strength and power are manifest in the lives of believers. These two books represent a damming indictment of just about everything any charismatic church [that I have been to] teach.  Like this passage - Paul's true strength is shown in his weaknesses cos it shows that his power comes not from himself, but from the grace of God - that to cope and succeed - depends not upon anything that Paul has or does - but upon the power of God. And even in measuring success and in demonstrating the true power he has - paul uses a very different perspective to any charismatic - or in fact most christians at all - that I know.   What anyone else dares to boast about--I am speaking as a fool--I also dare to boast about. Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I. Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers. I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked. Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches. Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn? If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying. In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me. But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.   Not a very glorious testimony really - shipwrecked, run out of town, naked, cold, laboured, toiled, hungry and thirsty - not very powerful - not very successful - not in the eyes of the world - but Paul didn't do those things for the worldly reasons he did it cos he loves God and loves God's people and wants to give his all for them - that is the sort of Heart I too long to have - a truely humble heart that will do anything it can for the people around it. Not a proud heart, arrogantly pretending to be humble.",

Where'd my angel go? Where's that little guardian that sits about spending his day making sure I don't cross the street and get hit by a car... get attacked by psycho killers in the middle of the night... protects me from the demons in my mind.... from heartache.. hearbreak and the devils of love...          Michael used to have his moments... We used to sit outside in his backyard at night... and mind you I was probably only 11 or 12 at the time.. right after Mom died.. It was a play off his name for me... though I'm sure his Mother chose the name very carefully (she's rather religious).. I used to tell him he was my Guardian Angel.. he made me feel safe and protected from all harm... and of course... Michael being Michael he would laugh and tease.. 'I'm not only your Guardian Angel princess, I am -the- angel. You don't get any better than me darling.' ... Very Michael-ish no?          I have no idea why I remember that...          The only thing Michael couldn't protect me from was Michael...          Sweet irony.. oh how I loathe you.. (I'm in a melodramatic mood... ignore me)           I do not believe there is one thing in this universe that is more complicated than love.. alright.. save Math.. if I can fail at Math.. I can certainly fail at love... There are so many types of love... sibling love.. family love.. friendly love.. passionate love.. love for ones neighbor.. ones country... and hell.. for all we know in a decade for ones planet or universe.. love for ones God...          You can love a friend as if they are your brother or sister.. or you can love a friend as they may also be your lover... your Father or Mother could be your best friend... your neighbor could be the confiding force you need to keep going through the years... Pride and love for your country gives you a sense of belonging... but so does your family.. your friends.. your community.           Furthermore the universal symbol for love is the heart... Now... considering I failed the part in bio where we discussed the human heart... I suppose it probably is fitting.. its just as damned confusing... illogical.. logic belongs to the brain.          So why do the brain and the heart compete so much over matters of love?          I've stopped making sense.. I'm going to go hide..          Yes..

        "blog_text": "I wrote this little piece several years ago after returning from gayday at Disney in Florida.  The day in the park is definitely the reason to go to such a thing.  I'd skip most, if not all, the circuit parties that have built up around it, though.    There it was, an endless line of people, snaking around the maze of crowd control gates.  All of these were people waiting for the same thing – Space Mountain.  After all these years – 24 years, in fact, I would finally join them.    It was a beautiful day.  The sun was bright, the Florida humidity was low, and all the people in the park appeared in fine spirits.  I was not just any day at Disney World, however; it was a special day that happens every year. Although, it never officially happens.  It was Gay Day at Disney!    Gay Day started in 1991 with just a group of gays and lesbians who decided to go to Disney World one day.  They told their friends, and those friends told their friends. And the numbers grew, 2,500 that first year according to the website.  Disney had no idea that they were secretly being invaded, visited by fairies of the terrestrial kind.  In succeeding years, the numbers of gays and lesbians who knew of and attended the event rose astronomically.  All this was done under the radar screens of the fundamentalist Christian groups  and the like.  Subtle signals had to be devised to show solidarity and demonstrate to Disney that the gays were in the park in significant numbers.  So, along came the red shirts, some generic, and some created just for the event.    This particular Gay Day was more than just that – it was a victory, a pilgrimage, as sort of triumphal act.   Now, I know what you are thinking: “Oh, great – another story about a gay man repressed in the past, and suddenly able to walk freely in world as himself and revel in the knowledge that he is not alone, not the only one, finally able to share in the fullness of life and love and heartbreak and desire.  Well, yes, this story has that, too.  That story has been done and I think we are all a little tired of it.    This story is one of childhood regrets, envy, and a father’s love and sacrifice, 24 years ago on the other end of the continent.    I, along with my family, went to Disneyland.  I was eight years old, my brothers six and ten.  I remember I was wearing blue shorts and a red t-shirt.  If that was a portent of things to come, it would come as a surprise to my younger brother, as he was wearing a red shirt that day, too, as I recall.    There it was . . . what the three boys wanted to see the most – even more that the mouse himself:  Space Mountain.  It was magnificent.  It was brand new.  The commercials on television touting the opening of this new ride played night and day on the LA channels we picked up on cable TV at our El Paso, TX home.  The excitement that they generated among the three pre-teen boys was palpable. When my parents announced that Disneyland would be a stop on our summer vacation, the days just couldn’t pass fast enough until we would be there.    And now, here we were, tickets in hand.  In the days before pay-one-price admission fees, Disney sold books of tickets that rationed the best rides based on the number of tickets a family was willing to purchase.  We’d rationed enough tickets for all five of us to ride Space Mountain.    The line for Space Mountain that day was the longest line, the largest organized mass of humanity I’d ever seen.  This is what we came for, and these boys would wait in that line for the ecstasy at the other end – Space Mountain!  And so we waited over an hour in the bright California sunshine, and arrived at the turnstiles.  There, the Disney cast member and cruel fate would conspire to create a lasting childhood memory.  As we stepped up to present our tickets, faces beaming, the Disney cast member produced an object, like an upside down “L” inscribed with the horrible words that would haunt me from that day forward:   “you must be at least this tall to ride this ride.”   You guessed it—after all those commercials, all that excitement, all those rationed tickets, I was not tall enough to ride the ride!   No  amount of pleading or swearing would convince the Disney cast member to overlook the height requirement just this once.  Imagine the conflict, the pandemonium among in the family.  What a decision!  My brothers were obviously thinking, “leave him! He’s too small!”  My father, never a fan of roller coasters in the first place, would just as easily have decided that the ride was not going to happen for anyone if it could not happen for everyone.    My mother chose pragmatic justice over my father’s approach.  She knew that to have one disappointed boy was better than having three.  This logical approach was communicated to my father using that wordless language that parents use.  And so it was decided that my mother and my brothers would ride Space Mountain, and my father and I would not.  This suited my father just fine, as he would not be required to ride Space Mountain.  We had plenty of tickets to use up anyway.  My mother and exuberant brothers headed through the turnstiles to Nirvana, and my dad and I off to the Dumbos and teacups.  Strange how if you’ve been smaller than your peers for most of your life, you always think of yourself as small.  But here we were, 24 years later, and all of 5 foot 6, still smaller than most, but easily able to avoid the prohibitions of the terrible “L” shaped measuring stick.  We waited patiently for our time on Space Mountain.  Fastpasses civilized the process by designating an hour window – essentially a reservation – to ride the ride.  As the turnstiles inched closer, my sense of victory and excitement grew.  I smiled at the Disney cast member and cast a hard glance at the measuring stick in his hand.",

I can tell you that Liberal is actually what they had in mind when they created Mayberry RFD, only without the cool sherriff and loveable characters.  The town teems with colorful characters, but on a darker, seamier side.  Our law enforcement team holds grudges with each other, but seem to be, on the most part, forgiving of slight trespasses our kids may commit.    Half of the windows are boarded up on Main Street, begging for someone to buy the building and try to make a go of it...  again...  We have good old boys driving beat up trucks, four-wheelers and ten-speeds through the town.  The ladies are as apt to smash each other's faces than to actually speak civilly to one another.  You are snubbed if you live in West Liberal,  (inseperable to all except residents here from Liberal itself.)  and are thought a great snob if you live on 'silver slipper avenue' Denton Street.  (once again, inseperable from the rest of Liberal.)   If you park your car in an unexpected place, speculation and rumor run rampant for two years.  This is all fairly negative stuff... I mean, seriously, I love living here, so where's all the good stuff?  Trees line the streets.  We have a Fall Festival that is so sweet and maudlin that it won't die, ever.  Kids write poetry here.   Sometimes, good poetry.   In the evenings, everyone is either on their porch or walking the tree-lined streets or riding bikes in family packs.  Farmers gather at Casey's and rib the manager about the outrageous gas prices.  If you park your car on the side of the road in an unexpected place, dozens of people appear and ask if you need help of some sort.  This is Liberal.  My home.

She comes across as someone who feels very insignificant in society and who has come into the Big Brother house in order to try and manipulate her new surroundings in order to reverse those roles. The fact that they are now all enclosed within the 'Big Brother bubble' seems to be a key which Kitten feels that she will now become significant, and more in control. Within 24 hours of being in the house she was openly discussing ideas of rebelling against the nomination process. Firstly, this seemed to be Kitten 'testing the water' to see how people would respond to her being dominant and dictating, and secondly, it seemed to be her openly displaying her inner worries about being unliked, still insignificant, even in the BB bubble, and therefore nominated. Another display of defiance, during the first nomination task, led to her being overlooked by Big Brother and unable to vote. I got the feeling she wanted Big Brother to keep pestering at her to get into the diary room. She looked miffed when they moved straight on, and became rather introverted when it became clear that her wonderful rebellion was already beginning to backfire. Continued acts of disrespect and defiance against Big Brother are always followed by tentative looks around at her fellow housemates, indicating a sense of wanting to be seen and to be accepted. Accepted not only as the dominant personality in the house but, primarily, accepted as a member of the house. I believe she is genuinely worried that she is not going to last a few weeks, and the bravado she displays in her rebellion against dictating Big Brother is merely a sorry facade for her need to feel wanted and accepted.

        "blog_text": "So, what is the deal with L.E.A.R. and why is it more than just another hip one act play about chick bands, record producers, boy bands gone wild and teen super stars with not-so-secret secret lives?   Actually, I'm not sure that it is more than that, but I'd like to believe that beneath and between all the funny lines and satirical characters, outrageous situations and blithe social commentary, there is a bit of heart and truth, even if it doesn't add up to full fledged profundity. Call me sentimental but I've always believed that without a little meaning, entertainment is not only sort of worthless, but less entertaining too. For better or worse, I like to go to a movie or a play, or listen to music and see art, and have it transform me or teach me something or just give me a soundbite to mull over. I don't like to just consume art, I like to be affected by it; I want to be a better, wiser, more understanding person after the experience.  That said, there's no reason why we can't laugh while we learn, and I think the best way to engange someone's head and heart is through their sense of humor or their sense of empathy, and I think L.E.A.R. is full of opportunities for both. At the center of the mess of monologues and vignettes there is the story of Simone and Tim, which is the real relationship around which all the silliness of the music industry is woven, an absurd context for something ordinary but heartbreaking which is happening to these two young people who love each other but need to still prove themselves as individuals and discover who they are. It was important to me, draft after draft, that they not only really care for one another but that Simone, as the woman in the relationship, was the stronger and more proactive of the two, forcing Tim to rise to her level as opposed to in most plays and movies, where it seems to always be the opposite, and the woman either stays home and supports her man while he goes out hunting for fame and fortune, or only embarks on her own quest because she's supposed to raise herself to his standard. Which is not to say that I don't think Tim is a nice guy, because I think he is and I wrote him as sympathetic; as male leads go in my canon of works, Tim's actually among the more likeable, though he's also decidedly more simple. Essentially, he's a really nice guy who, like most nice and simple guys, doesn't know how to live up to his potential, both as an individual and as one half of a couple. The best thing about Tim is that he's willing to let Simone, in the end, draw out of him the best he has to offer, and conversely the best thing about Simone is that she does this for Tim, thus making it so that he has more or less done the same for. They give each other a reason to be good people, honest artists, and ultimately good halves of a pair, but the way they get there isn't an easy one, and it has to come through, in the beginning, going seperate ways and letting go of each other for a while. I think this is something a lot of people can relate to, myself included (especially these days, it seems), and I'd like to believe (despite the cynical elements of my nature), that the happy ending Tim and Simone get is something we all get, though the road there may be long and hard. I don't think it's impossible though, given a good foundation, enough time, and hearts that never give up.  In contrast, I think the relationship between Nikolai and Francisco is a potentially interesting exploration of an absurd relationship in the context of a real world- think of how much they effect all the other characters in the play, and yet are always much more stuck on their own drama than any of the artistic and business matters at hand. Simone, despite the angst over Tim, is still focused first and foremost on the band, where as once their relationship falls apart, Nikolai drops all pretense of being a legit record producer in order to get back at Francisco, and in the process not only helps bring about the destruction of the Cunning Stunts, but the Burger Kings as well, even as Francisco's personal motivations helps to launch the career of the even more selfishly motivated Naomi. The problem is, neither of these men have art at the top of their priority list, but they have the power to make or break artsist; and I'd like to say that wasn't pretty much how the real world works but most of us who have spent any amount of time trying to 'make it' in pretty much any field of art know that there are all too many Nikolai's and Francisco's out there. If anything, I've been polite and affectionate in the creation of their characters, but despite giving them a happy ending it should be noted they don't give anyone else a happy ending: Tim and Simone have to strike out on their own at the end, and make it on their own terms. They get a happy ending not because they learn to succeed in the Nikolai and Francisco world, but because they recognize it for what it is, and realize they will be happier working outside it, even though that means sacrificing whatever it has to offer.  What it has to offer is the monumental but artistically empty success stories of Robin Swords and Naomi Finn, both of whom ostensibly represent the 'wrong' in the play, but honestly, despite the 'bitch' qualities to both, they aren't the villains. After all, as Robin freely admits, they wouldn't exist without the networks that create and support them, and they wouldn't act and climb the ladder as they do if they weren't being rewarded for it. Though its easy to see why we're not supposed to like Naomi, and why Robin is a laughable character at best and a kind of sinsiter one on another level, the fact is the much more lovable Francisco and Nikolai are really to blame for their existence, and it's important to recognize that beneath the charming gay boy veneer, these men are really in the business of making people over into monsters, and monsters they must become because that's the only way one can hope to survive in that world of constant exploitation and artistic compromise. When Francisco says to Naomi, 'First I'm gonna fuck you, then I'm gonna cut you, then I'm gonna leave you for dead,' it's funny because it's ridiculous; but when you recognize that he really does get off on this idea, it's also kind of scary. Likewise, there's something tragic about Nikolai propositioning Dimitri as a way to get back at Francisco's infidelity, but it's also kind of repulsive in the calculated way he does it, the ease with which he expects Dimitri to accept his advances, and the even more calculated manner in which Dimitri responds. That said, it's also plainly evident from the list of sexual acts they outline that Nikolai will be experiencing very little pleasure in this liason, but I'll readily admit I've always seen him as the more sympathetic of the pair.   The other characters just get farther and farther from that reality core of Tim and Simone. Phyllis and Malcolm are nice, but obviously she is mentally and emotionally unstable and he is too much of a deus ex machina to be taken seriously as anything more than a ludicrous allegorical figure (though people like him do exist in the art world as philanthropists and patrons, they are few and far between). What both represent is extreme ends of the music world that is the setting of the play- she the rabid fan, he the embittered star, she perpetually optomistic but needy, he constantly cynical but generous, she wrapped up in dreams and fantasies, he the manufacturer of celebrity myths and hooplah. Contrasted with this pair are Britney and Charlotte, so frighteningly normal and uninspired that it's absurd to suggest they make it through the two to three years of the Stunt's rise and fall- and yet the art world is full of people like these, there to do a job and collect a paycheck, somehow totally oblivious and/or apathetic to the passion plays and struggles of the Simones and Naomis that surround them. Even Britney's sympathy for Simone is the kind co-workers have for one another, which is not to say it's ingenuine though so much as it does seem to be relatively oblivious to who Simone is as a person let alone as an artist, and once Britney has passed on the problem for Malcolm to handle we never hear from her on the subject again. I don't think there is any better example of 'casual aquaintance' than that. The other boys in the Burger Kings are equally as absurd- again, more involved in the very narrow world of their personal problems and gratification than in the larger world of art, personal integrity and spiritual fullfillment that Simone and Tim are dealing with.  The intellectually interesting thing about L.E.A.R. is how those abstract virtues are held up as the representatives of the real, as opposed to the absurd things in the play- the insatiable greed for money, fame, drugs, sex, etc. But that's because Simone's perspective dominates the story, even though she speaks to the audience less than any other character in the play. Still, it is her journey we are following, and since her values are more abstract, the more earthly, material greeds of the other characters are by nature absurd, and she reacts and cognates them as such. Ironically, and kind of sadly when you think about it, this also means that in the end she is the outsider, for while she may be, as Tim puts it, 'the honest one,' she is vastly outnumbered, and while Simone is our heroine she's not kidding when she says 'I'm the foolish one,' implying that to have something like artistic integrity and still desire achievement is akin to being a fool or idiot. When you are the only sane person amongst lunatics, it doesn't take long to begin to doubt that, but on the plus side Simone comes to realize that the reason why she needs Tim is because he can provide validation for who she is. On her own, she always has her integrity and the music she makes, but with Tim in her life she also has his love (and her love for him) to show for it- the integrity and music become more meaningful when he is there to share it and for all his failings and human fallibility (of which she is hardly bereft) he is the best compliment to who she is, more so once he realizes it is both his duty and a source of great  personal happiness for him to be so.   It is this descent into an absurd world, and passage back to the sane through the recognition of the need for virtues such as loyalty, honesty, love and tolerance, that give L.E.A.R. both it's undertones of 'King Lear' esq tragedy, and also any emotional bite it might have. The happy ending has teeth because the best happy endings always do- because they come at the end of a journey that didn't always look like it was heading towards reconcilliations, understandings and new beginnings. The fact is, of course, most people sitting through L.E.A.R. are probably much more likely to just pay attention to the wacky antics and danceing boy band kids, with maybe a wistful sigh or two for Simone and Tim, but not much more thought than that. But as I wrote above, I always like to look for more in something, even the most frivilous entertainment, and since I'm sure I won't be the only guy who wants to find something to cure heartache in even the most unlikely of places, I thought it couldn't hurt to bury some treasure for anyone interested in looking for it. And that, more than anything, is what I'm all about in the end, because my heart is in this play and the complications of my life resonate with this story in even its most absurd and outlandish moments. Beneath the thoughts and the jokes there is something genuine here that I wrote years ago and set aside for later and now I'm here and have been discovering it all over again, just in time. So I'll take the hint and keep digging deeper, and maybe I'll get lucky and maybe 'One Day I Will See Everything' too.",

He was watching for kids darting out from between parked cars and slowed down when he thought he saw something. As his car passed, no children appeared. Instead, a brick smashed into the Jag's side door! He slammed on the brakes and backed the Jag back to the spot where the brick had been thrown. The angry driver then jumped out of the car, grabbed the nearest kid and pushed him up against a parked car shouting, 'What was that all about and who are you? Just what the heck are you doing? That's a new car and that brick you threw is going to cost a lot of money. Why did you do it?' The young boy was apologetic. 'Please, mister...please, I'm sorry but I didn't know what else to do,' He pleaded. 'I threw the brick because no one else would stop...' With tears dripping down his face and off his chin, the youth pointed to a spot just around a parked car. “It's my brother,' he said. 'He rolled off the curb and fell out of his wheelchair and I can't lift him up.' Now sobbing, the boy asked the stunned executive, 'Would you please help me get him back into his wheelchair? He's hurt and he's too heavy for me.' Moved beyond words, the driver tried to swallow the rapidly swelling lump in his throat. He hurriedly lifted the handicapped boy back into the wheelchair, then took out a linen handkerchief and dabbed at the fresh scrapes and cuts. A quick look told him everything was going to be okay. 'Thank you and may God bless you,' the grateful child told the stranger. Too shook up for words, the man simply watched the boy push his wheelchair-bound brother down the sidewalk toward their home. It was a long, slow walk back to the Jaguar. The damage was very noticeable, but the driver never bothered to repair the dented side door. He kept the dent there to remind him of this message: 'Don't go through life so fast that someone has to throw a brick at you to get your attention!' God whispers in our souls and speaks to our hearts. Sometimes when we don't have time to listen, He has to throw a brick at us. It's our choice to listen or not.",

        "blog_text": "Address to the Trustees of the Episcopal Divinity School, Cambridge, MA The Rev'd Elizabeth Kaeteon, rector and pastor  The Episcopal Church of St. Paul, Chatham, NJ Co-President of the AEC   I am pleased and privileged to be here with you this afternoon to be a representative voice of the alumni/ae of this wonderful, outstanding seminary.  I must leave early to catch a flight back home for a Vestry meeting tonight, but I would not have missed the opportunity to be with you today because I care deeply about this school and am passionately committed to its mission.   There are many ways to address the question of the use of the EDS Chapel as a sanctuary - in the fullest sense of that word - for the marriage of same sex couples.  I want to very briefly address three components: legal, theological and vocational.   In terms of the legal issues involved, I want to begin by stating what I learned from Dan Stevick in a course on Episcopal Liturgy and Polity.  In his wonderful succinct way, which quite correctly assumed that short statements were easier to learn and retain, he taught:  'National canon always trumps diocesan canon.  And, national canon is always trumped by the rubrics.' He also taught that 'liturgy precedes theology.' I may not remember what I had for breakfast this morning, but here I am, 18 years later, still able to recite lessons learned in seminary.   I completely understand the logic of the bishops in this diocese in their decision.  The national canons are clear in defining marriage as being between a man and a woman.  And, one might rush to say that the prayer book is also clear.  However, I direct your attention to the rubrics found on page 13 of the BCP - specifically the third paragraph:  'For special days of fasting or thanksgiving, appointed by civil or Church authority, and for other special occasions for which no service or prayer has been provided in this Book, the bishop may set forth such forms as are fitting to the occasion.'   I think this is the rubric which trumps national canon.  It allows for the development of an interim liturgy - until the national canons can catch up to the reality of the church - which may creatively and legally address the 'special occasion for which no service or prayer has been provided in this book' for the 'special day . . . appointed by civil . . . authority.'     I want to stress the INTERIM nature of this liturgical development.  I do not wish to create a situation of segregation which insists that the living waters of our faith be distributed from separate but equal fountains.  Rather, I believe that this is the kind of creative, generous, and reconciling response that allows justice to be served without delay (and therefore not denied) and yet within the parameters of our institutional life of faith as defined by canon and rubric.     It also proves Dr. Stevick's well-taught axiom:  'liturgy precedes theology.'  Thank goodness Mary said yes to God before the church could define the theology of the Incarnation or develop a theologically sound liturgy of baptism! Liturgy, indeed, precedes theology. But bold, decisive, prophetic action that is obedient to God's call precedes even liturgy.   And yet, it is directly to the point of theology.  What I learned here about the nature of God is that God's first impulse is always to love.  That Jesus, Emmanuel, God-made-flesh, is both love incarnate, love divine.  And, that the Holy Spirit, God's own Ruach which God breathed over the chaos which was before creation, continually inspires us to 'do a new thing' and empowers us to take our place as co-creators (and, Blessed Sue Hiatt would say, 'co-conspirators') with God.   What I learned here about the nature of leadership in community is that I am to model that understanding of God - to have as my first impulse the generous, gracious, inclusive love of God. To incarnate that love in every fiber of my being.  To be inspired and empowered to do a new, creative thing whenever the church-as-institution (as any institution is wont to do) seeks first not the risky Realm of God but rather, the security of its own salvation and preservation.    I learned that 'perfect love casts out fear' in ways that are too numerous to mention here in this very short amount of time. Suffice it to say that it allowed this second generation Portuguese-American woman, who came to this prestigious (and then, very WASP-y) seminary with her partner and six children, to dare to dream the dream of God that I be one of God's priests.  I learned that fear makes one miserly and stingy, constantly in search of the 'bottom line,' willing to cry 'Peace, peace, when there is no peace,' able to sacrifice justice on the altar of expediency, content with even the illusion of security rather than embrace 'the peace of God, which is no peace, but strife clothed in the sod.'   It was here, living and working and learning in the seminary which loved so perfectly it cast out the fear of merger and joined with another seminary, that I learned about the important merger of the pastoral and the prophetic. It was here that I witnessed a seminary which had cast out the fear of retribution when it hired two of the eleven women 'irregularly' ordained in Philadelphia that I dared to dream the dream of a God of full inclusion.  It was here, on my way to chapel, where I daily passed the statue of Jonathan Myric Daniels, who was martyred for the dream of God of racial equality. He is dead, but it was here that I learned that they can - and will - kill the dreamer, but they cannot kill the dream.    If other generations of seminarians will learn these lessons, then you, as Trustees, must not focus simply on theology or solely on the legal implications of this complex issue.  I understand that you have a sacred trust as fiduciary agents of this most amazing seminary and that your first impulse is one to protect and conserve, and I thank you for bearing the burden of that responsibility.   I urge you, however, to consider carefully the vocational implications of the questions raised by the use of the chapel as a sanctuary for ALL God's people.  What is it that God is calling us to do?  In the midst of this Kairos moment in the church, what is God's dream for this seminary and the role it will play in the church?  Can we dare to dream that dream?  Can we find the creativity, the generosity and the reconciling nature of God which is within each one of us and use it, not for our own glory or the glory of this seminary, but rather, for the glory of God?  That all who see and know of our deeds will give God praise - and even enthusiastically send a seminarian to this school, or make an additional and substantial contribution to enable our mission?   Once we respond faithfully to these questions of vocation, the theological, legal and even fiduciary implications of our decision will be in service of what God is calling us to do.    At least, that's what I learned here as a seminarian.  And, I trust, this vocational response remains the primary lesson that this seminary teaches - by word and deed and example.",

        "blog_text": "After reading this post , I started thinking about my own strange relationship with death.  My aunt and grandmother both died several thousands of miles away from me, and I never went to their funerals.  Though I was sad that I would never see them again, I honestly didn’t know them very well.  I still have vivid memories of summers spent at their houses, and that has always been enough.  For me, they were people close to my father, and most of the pain I felt from their deaths was seeing him so heartbroken.    When an acquaintance from high school committed suicide, at first I felt an overwhelming shock.  There is something desperate and broken about the idea of an eighteen-year-old boy ending his own life.  But on a more personal level, it was again an empathic sort of grief.  He had been very close to one of my best friends, and I felt that I was only sharing something that really belonged to her.  I could let it go at will, detach myself from it as being a horrible event in someone else’s life.  I think that the first time I really understood grief, the time it was so gigantic and overwhelming that I felt I couldn’t control when it came or went, I couldn’t—and still can’t—even see a way around it, was last summer when my husband and I watched his father die of cancer.    When we first got to Madison, he was still very much the same person.  Obsessively selfless, determined, dryly witty.  Although he was sick, he still worried about being the good host.  He even threw one of his famous backyard picnics, where there was too much beer, too much food and all of the children were so high on sugar they couldn’t remember how to walk.  He made a speech, thanking the caregivers of his elderly mother, and I know for certain it was the speech that made people cry, not the fact that he was so obviously ill.    But it  was  obvious.  He was in pain.  He was tired.  For hours at a time, the light in his eyes would grow dim and vague.  He wouldn’t be ready with a joke, he would just have to sit there concentrating on breathing.  I don’t remember how long it was we stayed.  It didn’t really matter.  Our only purpose was to try and make things easier.  In truth, we were probably trying to make the things that were happening not happen.  Even when the hospice people arrived--and this must have been a week or so before his death--we were still discussing ways that we could help him get better.  They knew they were there just to make him as comfortable as possible in the last days of his life.  We were still fighting our own battle against facing this horrible, inevitable thing.  We saw our hope dwindle until it turned on us into a fierce desperation, and then, finally, we began the completely unmanageable task of acceptance.  And I found out that accepting death, when it is right there in front of you, is like trying to eat the universe.  It is completely impossible and yet you can’t ignore it, because it is everywhere.  I still watch my husband struggling with it, and I know there are whole days that are lost to him,  because he is staring at the world through this immeasurable haze.  A year later, my own grief is like a giant monster in a closet.  Whenever it’s let out it seems terrible and uncontrollable, but eventually it goes skulking back to where it lives and closes the door.  I know that as the years go by, it will get smaller.  Maybe someday it will disappear.  But the closet will remain, and it will always remind me what was there.  I am hoping that as time goes on, rather than a hole left by a death, I will remember the space filled with the immense spirit of the man that lived.",

        "blog_text": "Twenty years ago, I saw my first football match. I can tell you the following facts about that game: Leeds Utd. were at home against Huddersfield Town in Division 2 and Town were wearing pink shirts. That’s it. You read biographies where people can tell you the team, the subs, the time of the goals and the attendance. I haven’t a clue. That day was about spending time with my dad and two uncles (it may have been a Boxing Day match – again, I’m not sure), although there may have been an ulterior motive. I distinctly remember my father trying to explain that the game he was going to be important because it could mean that Leeds would be at the top of a big list of team names when I was very young.  As you will know from reading this site, there are times that I absolutely despise football. Why do I pay a small fortune to follow a team that is likely to be turned over nearly every week? This isn’t the first time I’ve done it – the year of the Wilkinson/Graham handover bore some of the worst matches you are ever likely to see (Leeds scored 5 goals less than Alan Shearer that season and named eight recognised defenders against First Division Portsmouth in the cup). The year before, I travelled to London to watch Leeds be destroyed by a striker that the next year the fans would hound out of the club (Funny story – went to school the next day, knackered and depressed from the trip. Becky Smith saw more and asked what was up. When I said “tired from travelling”, she said, with the biggest grin on her face “Oh! I watched it! You’re team are REALLY shit!” Cunt). This also being the same year that our strike force for one match was 36 year old Lee Chapman and 36 stone Tomas Brolin, our record signing. The year after winning the League, I watched a team that didn’t win away all season, while a player our manager decided wasn’t suitable for our side went across the Pennines and led his new team to their first championship in decades. I got my first season ticket the year that we nearly were relegated to Div 2. I have seen players brought in on small fortunes only to be reduced to the level of journeymen while seeing our exciting young players move on for a pittance. I’ve seen managerial and boardroom decisions perplexing in their stupidity. And yet, I go.  I hate the way that I have missed days out and parties to go to an open-air stadium in the drizzle and watch a match that I have known for weeks will be abject and depressing. I hate the look on TFMrs’s face when I explain I can’t go see her family because I have to go see Middlesbrough in action. I hate the way that I will not talk to people in pubs when a game is on because I need to consider the tactical implications to the game caused by the substitution of Zoumana Camara for Michael Duberry. I hate how a game against Arsenal can leave me in a horrible, aggravated mood for a week.  So, why do I follow Leeds and subject myself to this crap?  Because thrashing the worst team in the league, meaning that for two weeks we are not the bottom team, despite having a depleted squad and the likelihood of administration in a few weeks time, is one of the best fucking feelings in the world. Christ, I even love Viduka this morning.",

        "blog_text": "Hmm, I've got alot of catching up to do. Let's make a brief summary of my week: \nDec.23-25:  My brother and I drove down to meet my parents in Canmore for Christmas. We skiied (well, my bro and I snowboarded) at Sunshine Village on 24th and 25th. There were lots of New Zealanders and Australians skiing there, and I always love listening to their accents. The skiing conditions were good the first day and absolutely perfect the second day since it had snowed on X'mas eve. So powdery, it was like heaven. It was an excellent time. I got alot of Victoria's Secret merchandise (not lingerie) from my parents, and some lucky money. Merv and I came back on the night of Christmas. \nDec. 26  Spent my last day with Dan before his big trip to Australia. It was nice, but sad.  Yes, I did cry when we had to say good-bye.  Awww.  I have to keep reminding myself it's only for 2 months (well, 7 weeks, but saying 2 months seems shorter). Dan gave me my Christmas presents that night. He got me Green Tea (which I love), some sparkly, pretty Cranberry lotion from the BodyShop, and a red babydoll type lingerie from La Senza. Unfortunately, when I tried on the lingerie, we both thought that it did not really suit (i.e., FLATTER) me, and I thought I looked rather preggo. 'But it looked good on the La Senza models,' Dan says.  Hello? I do not have a La Senza model body!  Of course I did not get upset that the lingerie didn't fit, I just understand that it's better suited for taller and slimmer women. For me, my torso was too short and all you could see were my muscular thighs poking out of the outfit. I looked rather terrible. That's ok, I get to exchange it for anything I like. \nDec. 27-30  Jenn and I took the Greyhound to Calgary, where her step-mom, Olga, and her dad,  Ta Ta  (that's 'dad' in Polish), were waiting for us so that we could all go to Fairmont together. We were only there until the 30th, so we fit in 2 days of skiing (for her) and snowboarding (for me) at Panarama the first day and Kimberly the next. Panarama sucked because it was icy and Kimberly was in okay to good conditions. \nJenn's boyfriend, Steve, picked us up this morning and we went back to Edmonton. It was Steve, Jenn and Andrew in the front seat of the big truck and Rob, me and Mark in the backseat. It actually was not as squishy as I had imagined it to be, and it was quite comfy. We had great conversations about music, sex and diarrhea.  The major highlight of the roadtrip back was when the boys started arguing about how long each one of the divided dotted-white-lines were on Highway 2. Steve was convinced that a line was about 15-20 feet long and Mark and Andrew were rooting for 10-15 feet.  So what did they do after arguing for ten minutes?  Steve pulls over on the side of the road, gets his measuring tape out and into oncoming traffic, him and Rob run out and measure a line in 2 seconds as the cars get closer and closer, then they sprint back to the truck.  The result?  The line was 13 feet long, so  Mark and Andrew were right. I wonder, was it really worth risking your life to know how long a freakin' line on the road was?! \nOkay...I need to get personal and get something off my chest right now, blow of some steam... \nI had fun most of the trip, but I seemed to see a side of my so-called best friend that I haven't really experienced before and I didn't like it. She was impatient, condesending and a bit unappreciative at times, which really hurt and disappointed me. I pretended it wasn't that bad, since most of the trip she was pretty much herself. \nHowever, she had pulled the last straw when later on tonight, she called me to tell me that I could not invite my other best friend, Michelle and her boyfriend Byron, to Steve's New Year's party. She used the excuse that Steve did not know them well enough, was worried that something may happen to his place, and that there would be too many people. These were not valid arguments since Steve did not know any of our other friends that I invited and I called her on it. She also knew very well that both Miche and Byron would not do any harm and what is 2 more people anyway?  Also,  I was definitely not going to scoop to a low level to snub Michelle and Byron just to go to a party full of people I hardly know. I'd much rather spend New Years with a small group of close friends if that's how it's going to be. \nIt made me so mad when Jenn said this to me, and it only made me more angry when she called back to tell me that there had been a mix-up and that either I or she misunderstood that Byron and Michelle could not come. Right then and there, I smelled total Bullshit, so I called her on it again. The only reason why she didn't want Miche and Byron there was because she's not fond of him...not because she doesn't know him (like she used as an excuse). For  sake, Miche and Byron have been together for 4 years, so don't tell me she doesn't know him. That is total crap and she knows it. If she really wanted them to come, she could have  easily  convinced her boyfriend to let them come. \nHow can she do this to a group of friends? How can she make it so that some are good enough and others are not, to come to a party? Especially when she knew very well that nothing less is expected that New Years should be spent with closest friends. Did she really expect me to be okay with snubbing them? That bothers me so much, and it bothers me even more that she seems like she could care less that everyone else but me, comes or doesn't come to the party. I think the biggest reason she wants me to be there is not because I'm her so-called best friend, but so that she doesn't have to feel uncomfortable around Steve's friends, since she claims she's shy, but totally isn't. Hey, isn't that using someone? \nIt's amazing how in 4 days, you can learn so much about a person and realize they are not who you think they are. All these years of friendship and as different (as in an odd, peculiar way) as Jenn is and as unreliable as she is, she has been a good friend to me for the most part. Interesting how my perspective of her can change in 4 days.  I talked to one of my friends who use to be good friends with her in high school, and her words struck me:  I'm sorry you had to find out about Jenn this way. \nThese words confused me even more, but after this friend explained how she had a similar experience with Jenn, I understood. I painfully understood and could not believe it. All these years, I didn't understand why these 2 girls (also my friends) had drifted away from Jenn since the three of them were so tight in high school. All these years, it had been there and I was so blind to the truth. \nI feel so confused, yet angry, and saddened by this whole situation. It makes me a bit cynical. Man, Jenn was someone who I thought I could live with, but after these 4 days, I know I can't. We were also planning to possibly take a trip together to France, but there is absolutely no way I would go with  just  her. I cannot explain it, but some of the things she says or does are so insensitive, condescending, confusing and contradictory, that, by the time I answer, I am still in shock of what or how she has said her words.  I am pretty sensitive, and some of the things she said or did on the trip really hurt me, even though they weren't a 'big deal'. It just hurts because she's never really treated me this way before and I had no idea who she was half the time. I mean, is this who she really is? Was this just a 'bad 4 days' for her? I'm sure we'll stay friends, but I'm not sure if I could consider her a best friend now. It doesn't seem right to. I could go on about other things that frusterate me about her, but then I'd be getting into details. I'll spare you that. \nI really wish you were here right now, Dan. You're so good at comforting me in a way that no one else can. \nAnyway, I am totally looking forward to spending New Year's with my closest group of friends tomorrow evening. Hope you all have a great New Year! I'll keep ya posted on what happens. Thanks for reading.",

        "blog_text": "So, earlier today, my Mom came in my room to play some games on the computer (this has been going on for about 1-1/2 years... and will continue til she finally just orders her own Dell computer... which has been the talk going on for the past 1-1/2 years!) and so I put on a jazz cd.  I put on the Ron Wilkins cd that I have... and 'A Night in Tunisia' came on... it made me think of being in HS... and arriving early at school so I could sit in the bandhall and listen to the jazz band rehearse on a Monday morning... this was because Ben Rockstroh had asked me to come so he'd have a face to look at while Smith yelled at the Saxaphones during their rehearsal of 'A Night in Tunisia.'  It took them forever to play it at tempo. Memories.  I really miss being in high school... this has been a feeling that I've encountered a lot in the past 3-4 months.  I mean, being 22/23 has its perks... believe me.  But, I also miss the simplicity and carefreeness that comes with being 15-18 and in high school.  :-\\  It was at this point that an older friend of mine suggested that I sounded as if I was going into my quarter life crisis, and sent me a poem thing.  Some of the things are VERY MUCH on my mind, while others aren't yet, because A) I like the job I have/profession I'm going into (til I become a mommy, that is), or B) I'm not done with school yet (but it IS on the horizon, believe it or not... I know what I have left as far as classes).  Check out the poem, tell me what you think... I think this could explain my mind and how it's been the past semester/few months better than I ever could:  They call it the 'Quarter-life Crisis.' It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are a lot of things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like.   You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now. You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones.   What you do not realize is that they are realizing  that too and are not really cold or catty or mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you are.   You look at your job. It is not even close to what you thought you would be doing or maybe you are looking for one and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and are scared. You miss the comforts of college, of groups, of socializing with the same people on a constant basis. But then you realize that maybe they weren't so great after all.   You are beginning to understand yourself and what you want and do not want. Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging a bit more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and add things to your list of what is acceptable and what is not.   You are insecure and then secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward.   You get your heartbroken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you or you lay in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough to get to know better. You love someone but maybe love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you are not a bad person. One night stands and random hookups start to look cheap and getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic.   You go through the same emotions and questions over and over and talk with your friends about the same  topics because you cannot seem to make a decision. You worry about loans and money and the future and making a life for yourself and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender!   What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it. We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out. We are making a lot of mistakes, but helping one another learn from them and reaching out to pull one another up. We are not the shiniest group of people, but we are very much a circle. We  are there for one another and will listen and grow for the rest of our lives. We will piss one another off, but we will also heal one another's hearts.  We are the group who sometimes doesn't need words but will laugh at the end of a conversation that started with angry words. We are friends and in 10 years, when we have figured out where we fit in in this world, we will still be friends always and forever!",

I've had a gym membership the entire 3 and a half years I've been at my job. My first membership was to Club One, which I went to about 4 times total. No motiviation at all, even though I went with a co-worker. My current gym is with 24 hour fitness. This is better because there is one closer to my home and work now than there is a Club One. Had I used it at all? No.   Today I went to my local 24 Hour Fitness. I was determined to break the gym barrier and actually go use it. I walk in and check in, so far so good. The desk guy is pretty nice and lets me know I have the Ultra membership which entitles me to not only use any gym I want but I can use the ultra sports clubs which have day spas and juice bars and stuff. Neat. Okay I did a lap around the gym to check out what was available. It wasn't too crowded which was nice. There's a pool in the back which is pretty cool. It seemed nice overall. I felt pretty comfortable.  I decided to use the elliptical today. Which is funny because I actually owned an elliptical which I got rid of from non use. Of course mine wasn't nearly as good as these were. I wasn't sure how long I'd last on it because usually I go about 10 min and want to pass out. Today I went a whole 30 min plus. 2 and a half miles, 300 calories burned. It seemed so easy too. I think all the strength training I'm doing is paying off. You see, even though I seem lazy (and generally am lazy) by not going to the gym I do go to a personal trainer two days a week to do super slow weight lifting. It's pretty gruelling but I keep increasing the amount of weight I am using so I know I'm getting stronger. Anyways, long story short, I loved the gym and plan on going back again tomorrow.  In fact I realized something about myself today. Something that I'd read in C's blog about why she goes to the gym. Going to the gym with a lot on your mind (among other things) can really help push you through the workout. I've been a bit heavy hearted the last few days. Not caused by anything bad, but more likely caused by a longing or a hope. Rather than dwell on what if's I decided to go work it out at the gym and that was the formula I needed to motivate me to succeed. I look forward to working all this out at the gym everday if I can! I'm actually pretty excited by the whole gym thing and am happy about that. Life's not so bad.",

        "blog_text": "nothing in the world prepares you for looking into a parent's face and seeing what you're going to become. It happens to everyone at some point, for me it was a few days after my mom had her stroke. It's a mild one, all things considered. Perhaps if she was drooling, and couldn't button her shirt, or couldn't walk, it might actually be easier. But instead she appears completely normal, until she tries to drink milk out of a spoon because she thinks it's a glass. Or she goes to the microwave to put the orange juice away. The mirror is cracked, when I look into her face, and the crack is so slight, that it needs a good look before being discerned. \n\nI have been taking care of her for a month. I've had a few days of respite, when a neighbor has come in to tend to her and I've gone home to wash, do laundry, grocery shop, and try to fit back into my mom/wife suit that doesn't work either. I'm walking two different worlds. And don't fit into either. I've found the patience I never thought I had -- can tell my mom for three days the name of the doctor we'll be seeing next. And remind her continuously that she mustn't chop down the wisteria alone, or go into the garage for the plum jam without a helper. She understands as she hears me, then promptly tucks the info away into a recess now seldom visited.\n\nFriends and neighbors, bankers and therapists marvel after a telephone call, knowing little of what happens when she hangs up the phone, smiles and reports that she's taken a call. Cannot remember from whom or what was discussed, but it made her smile nonetheless. \n\nShe has to build new pathways -- her brain will regenerate new nerve roads and hopefully she'll be able to get her right field of vision back, and be able to look upon the English or even German words which cover get well cards, and understand what kind thoughts are being sent her way. This they tell me, the doctors and therapists, and even my sister who frustrated in the distance of California cannot reach out but to call daily and lend opinion and send flowers.\n\nI dream of Italy and my own library, I see my children grown and independently taking up the consequences of their decisions and hanging onto what we know as a livelihood. But I hear my mother's frustrated lament every day, why me, I was a good person, I took care of myself, I wanted to do so much. She waited, you see, for Daddy, 12 years older, to pass on, hoping for a few good years with which to follow some dreams perhaps found in those very spaces her brain cannot now incorporate. I am not slow. I get it after watching her roll up her hair and monitoring her medicine intake. Chemicals, by the way, she never took, never needed, never believed in. Perhaps still doesn't but takes for our sakes.\n\nI will finish my degree and get my library and work with my school's kids. But I will not wait to do the other things I think I might want to do. I will do them as they occur. Like going to the Artemisia and Orazio Gentileschi exhibit in NYC. Whatever became of that person. Grabbing a friend and a weekend and going. And greedily holding onto that memory like a nugget. Or my ride at the Renaissance Fair on an elephant, although I could have chosen the camel. Me barefoot, stroking its needle baby hairs and feeling the Sahara leather and the rhythm of the ages under my thighs. My children watching in amazement at their mother's oddly enviable courage. I want many nuggets like that. My mother remembers the past so clearly -- and the perversity is that her youth past was horrid -- the war, the hunger, the bombardment, the escape. The memories of happiness are fewer. I want to make those memories of happiness so I have them later.\n\nSo herewith a list not to do before I die, but before I too get my crack. Before I can no longer make of the experience a treasure to bring forth whenever I need: \n\nEating pasta in Florence and touching the walls of the Colosseum in Rome, alone or with a friend.\nA return to the Musee D'Orsay in Paris with Ilana\nA story published anywhere\nThe wailing wall of Israel and the Parthenon and Aphrodite's temple in Greece, explored and understood (a lifetime perhaps)\nAn oil painting class, preferably in flowers\nMy own cat again from kitten\nA train ride across the United States, the silver streak variety from which I can see a sunrise and sunset over the differing vistas that make up this grand country.\nA sushi class\n\nThat's it for now. There will be more.\n\n~K",

        "blog_text": "Attending NCECA in San Diego in 2003 was a turning point for me in many ways.  Little did I know when several people asked if I was going, that it was more than I could have imagined.  I went reluctantly, tired from work, but curious.  When I got there I was lost, and wandered aimlessly, not knowing what I had walked into.  I paid my $65, and set off to see what it was that everyone thought was so great.  I wandered in and out of lectures and demonstrations.  I was most interested in the business lectures, only really wanting to find a way to make a living doing what I love.  I wandered through exhibits, spying the mug sale, the cone box contest, and the k-12 children's entries.  Was my stuff up to par with the 'real' teachers who had a degree?  I vowed I would enter next year, just to be competitive.(I didn't , but that's another story).  I was really excited to go to the basement area where everyone was selling everything. Tools I didn't know existed, schools beckoning (asking myself, how would my life had been different if I had majored in ceramics, and not married and had children), companies throwing samples my way by the caseloads.  Paper, paper, and more paper. The next day was better, knowing that I was there to learn as much as possible in a short time period. I sat through lectures and demos. I absorbed conversations and watched people look and watch.    When I got back home to my studio, I wasn't the same.  When I left, I was a housewife that had more than a passing interest in a hobby.  I was an entrepreneur, trying to find the holy grail that would catapult me from sometimes breaking even to supporting myself.    When I came back, I felt like an artist.  I realized I knew much more than I thought.  I realized that the real world experience I had jumped into blindly had given me more opportunity than most people get in a lifetime of study.  I saw my life 20 years from now, and 40 years from now, planning what I would like to do when the kids are grown and this season of my life had passed.  I saw myself, 70 years old, touching the clay and asking the questions......  First , when I got back to work, I was engulfed by production and exploring new avenues of business.  I taught with a new confidence, that yes, I knew what I was doing with what I did, and everything else would come later.  I experimented more, and slowly the studio became a studio, not a storefront.  I had an apprentice, and a muse.  I would spend hours with the music on, in the silent of my space, pondering the next projects, or working with ferocity.  I realized the sacrifices I had made as an artist, in my ventures as a businesswoman.  I had no extra time or energy to 'create' for the sake of creating, going into the unknown with no 'agenda'.  I did not know what that felt like.    I closed the studio. It felt like death.  Where was my purpose without a store to support?  I hated being just a mother.  I almost couldn't do it, and didn't have to.  I had renegotiated my lease for pennies.  But I knew I had to cut off my arm for another one to grow literally.  I moved the studio to my home, like a lot of potters do.  I am lucky that I have patient people who live with me that accept the studio taking over the whole of the house.

The management had not informed us, the teachers, of the new enrolment. I approached and asked him some basic questions. His age placed him eventually in my class. Later in the class I had to fill in the register. He was Greek, his father was Greek but he had recently moved to London from Cairo, Egypt. For an migr offspring his Greek was excellent. I asked his mother's name in order to fill my draft report. He looked around and declined to tell me. If you can't say it in Greek you can spell it in English I insisted. He leaned towards me, like telling a secret and wispered to me that she was neither Greek nor English and that she wasn't with the daddy any more. Just forget it, he said, don't put it in. Later I realised what was the cause of his anxiety. His mother was muslim. He was in a Greek-Orthodox Cristian School and he didn't want to be labelled as 'the Muslim'.   In the multicultural capital of Europe, in the eve of the 21st century, a 9 year-old boy was renouncing his own mother, conscious of the established prejudices of a society living in fear for the 'other'.

        "blog_text": "“Sir?” “Yes, Coco, what is it?” “Necco is on line two, would you like me to put him through?”  Necco, finally! “Yes, thank you…oh and Coco…hold all my other calls.” “Yes Sir.”   A cruel smirk formed on Dee’s lips, he was so close he could taste it! Unconsciously, he began to smooth the creased leather on the arm of his executive chair as he grew minutely excited.  Necco would have an answer for him today, he thought, that he would.  In a smooth fluid movement, he adjusted his earpiece and microphone, and then leaned forward to connect to the call.  “Necco, tell me you’re calling with good news….or give me a good reason not to fire you.” “Whoa, whoa, whoa Mista K, ease up.  You know I’m your man.  The shipment just came in and I’m working the closing shift tonight at the Pussycat.  W-w-will you be by at your usual time?” The yearning in Necco’s voice excited him.  There was a time when Necco didn’t like to play his games, now it seems like he could not rid himself of the little welp.  “Only if you’re good, will you be good?” The momentary silence on the other end of the line told him that Necco was struggling mentally with his feelings.  He was both delighted and repulsed by what he felt when they were together…playing the game.  “Y-yes, s-sir,” he answered in a defeated whisper.  “Good boy, I shall see you at 6 then.”  “M-mister K, I-I jus--” *click* Dee quickly disconnected the call as he had no time for Necco’s inarticulate words of affection; he had things to do before he could enjoy the evening’s festivities.  Dee turned in his chair and faced the window of his corner office; the view was chaotic. It faced 45th Street and Park Avenue, which was a jumbled disarray of people, traffic and coffee carts.  He despised the city’s disorganization, its haphazard way of functioning.  He preferred things orderly, arranged and systematic.  Dee, born Delicioso Kandemhan, a joke of a first name given to him by his Spanish mother, had started at the company when he was 21 as an intern.  At the time the company name had been Ce & Ce Candy Co., owned by Cecil and Celeste Marzipan who had began as confectioners nearly 40 years before Dee arrived on the scene.  It had been advantageous of him to meet both of them at a company function where they took to him instantly.  After his initial period as an intern, he worked directly for Cecil and Celeste as an assistant, subsequently working his way to where he was today—an owning partner at what was now called Ce & De Candy Confectioners.  With his perseverance he had pushed the company from being the makers of a handful of different kinds of sugarcoated items to a corporation that included thousands of varieties of candies, from the exotic to the nostalgic as well as beverages and pastries.  Now here he was, 15 years later, in a position of power; a place he knew he’d always be.   “Sir,” Coco’s voice rose from the intercom and seemed to wrap around his lower body like a soft fur blanket.  Dee frowned, not liking that he had no control over his body when it came to Coco.  This was one of the reasons he never made any attempt to include her into his circle of sexual friends.  “Yes, Coco, what is it?” He barked impatiently. “You asked me to remind you about your appointment with your trainer.” Coco’s voice was cool and neutral and he wondered if he had hurt her feelings, just the thought that he may have broke through her cool demeanor excited him to the point where he almost asked her to come into his office. “Thank you Coco, I was just about to leave.  I’ll be reachable by Blackberry.” “Yes sir.”  Dee grabbed up his gym bag and walked determinedly past Coco towards his private elevator without as much as a sideways glance.  Coco watched him leave.  She stared at his tall, slim frame as it confidently strode into the elevator.  Damn he’s fine, Coco thought, no man should be that damned pretty.    She could still remember the day she interviewed for the position here; she truly thought she had no chance in hell in getting it.  There had been about 12 other women in the room that day to interview with Mr. Kandemhan, all white and she, the only black latina.  She overheard that some of the women even had MBA’s, Coco only had an Associates degree from the local community college; she couldn’t compete.  She was ready to leave when a coolly detached voice came over the intercom, “Ms. Villanueva, please come in.”  Coco started towards the oak wood double doors, wondering how the person who had called her in could pronounce her name perfectly, distinctly.  She even had trouble pronouncing it some days. She stepped into what she thought was the most unusual outer office she’d ever seen.  It was circular shaped furnished with only a huge circular cherry wood desk and high back leather chair.  A diminutive elderly woman sat at the desk and without a word pointed to the double doors behind her.  Coco continued on through the second set of double doors, faintly smiling at the woman as she past her.    Stepping through the doors, Coco’s mouth almost fell as she took in the huge two-level office that seemed bigger than her entire Bronx apartment.  A tall slim man stood looking out of the ceiling to floor windows that took over an entire back wall of the office.  The office itself was fastidiously ordered, there was a place for everything and everything was in its place. She studied the man’s appearance a moment longer before walking towards the enormous leather covered desk.  He wore his hair long, bound by what looked like a leather strap into a neat ponytail and his skin, what she could see of it, looked as if it had been kissed by the sun.  “Good morning Mr. Kandemhan, I’m--” He turned swiftly towards her and held his forefinger out to silence her.  “Absolutely Cecil, I’ll be there tonight, yes…yes… wonderful…send my love to Celeste, ciao.” Mr. Kandemhan turned his attention to Coco and she suddenly wished she had walked out on the interview.  Staring into her soft brown eyes were the coldest looking black eyes she’d ever seen, she could swear he looked at her with contempt.  But then he spoke, his voice seemed hot and cold at the same time; making Coco think of things she shouldn’t, like how would this man look naked.  I can’t work here, she thought, I’d end up doing my boss and that ain’t good.  “Ms. Villanueva, it’s a pleasure.  Please sit,” he said, motioning to the large overstuffed leather chair in front of his desk.  She placed her resume on his desk then sat down.  She had worn her best cream suit because it brought out her caramel coloring and flattered her curvaceous form.  Her dark long curls were wrapped in a tight professional bun showing off her long neck.  Before she walked in this office she felt as beautiful as a swan, now she felt like prey.  “Ms. Villanueva, I won’t kid you about this position, it’s very demanding.  I require more than usual from my assistants,” He paused, looking directly into her eyes and asked, “What can you offer that the others cannot?”  Coco could feel the blush creep up on her face; she’d been watching his full lips annunciate every letter of every word he spoke and didn’t believe he would turn his almond-shaped eyes up to look at her again. She was speechless, his request almost sounded sexual. Taking a moment to think about it, she decided to just be honest, besides she wasn’t getting the job anyway.  “Other than making sure you’ve bathed, there’s no particular task that I can’t do,” swallowing hard she continued, “as you can see from my resume, I type 65 – 70 words per minute, am familiar with all PC and MAC software as well as 3 different type of accounting software.  I am professional, detail oriented and very well organized.  I believe given the opportunity to work for you, I would become an essential part of your company.” Her speech delivered, she inhaled, and then exhaled.  “And?” He asked, slightly smirking.   “Umm and Mr. Kandemhan?” She replied, stumped. “Yes, Ms. Villanueva, and?  What else can you offer me? This position pays $65,000 annually plus benefits and bonuses.  I’m going to need a little more than an average glorified executive assistant; this person would be an extension of me, representing me in my absence.  So I reiterate, Ms. Villanueva, what else can you offer me?”  OH NO HE DIDN’T!! Coco thought. He did NOT just call me average! I’ll tell you what I can offer you, you damned prick, how about a little color up in this company!! You got like two black people in this building and that INCLUDES me and the janitor!! Coco couldn’t believe how much she wanted to smack this man’s hateful smirk of his gorgeous lips.  She took a deep breath then spoke.  “Mr. Kandemhan, I can do what the position requires and if there’s something I can’t do, I’ll learn.  Other than that, I don’t know what else I can offer.”  “Hhmm, I see.  Thank you, Ms. Villanueva that will be all.  Please show yourself out.” He had dismissed her.  Just like that.  Coco stood, reached over the desk and shook his soft hand, then turned and walked out of the office with her head held high.  She was too damned proud to cry until she got on the train home.  When Coco did get home she was completely taken aback to find a message from him waiting for her on her machine.  His distinctly clipped voice stating, “Congratulations Ms. Villanueva, you start Thursday.  Be sure to get in contact with the Human Resource office to fill out the necessary paperwork.”  Now here she was, two and a half years later, still working for a man who spoke to her as if she were a bad taste in his mouth he could not spit out fast enough.  But, now she’s paid $70,000 plus bonuses and as long as she was getting paid, he could talk to her as if she were the devil himself, she didn’t care.  The only thing she didn’t like was how her body responded to him when he lashed out on her.  No man should be that damned pretty.  Dee had just finished his daily power workout with Wrigley, his personal trainer.  He decided to hit the private steam room before he went back to the office to meet with Mr. Cadbury, his company’s chemist, about a project they were working on.  Although the workout was extremely rigorous, it had not squelched the seed of desire that had begun in his office.  Damn it all to HELL!  Dee thought I’m in control, no one else just me! I just have to work this thing out of my system. What he needed was a quick fix to put him back on top.  Dee looked up at a sound he heard near the entrance of the steam room and smiled.  At the door, already on all fours like a good little girl was Ginger.  She was the beautiful redhead who worked the reception area, handing out towels, t-shirts and locks to members of the exclusive gym.  Dee leaned his well-formed body against the smooth porcelain ledge of the steam room seat and sneered at her.   “Little girl, little girl, why are you here?” Dee asked in a singsong manner.  Ginger crawled forward several steps and answered in the same way, “To relish in the pain that will bring you good cheer.”  The sneer on Dee’s face turned into a radiate grin, his teeth bared in a savage manner. “Little girl, little girl, wouldn’t you want some?” Ginger closed the distance between them until finally she was kneeling between his legs, wearing nothing but an open robe and holding out a rider’s crop. “My cheer will begin when my pain makes you cum.”  His grin was now maliciously beatific; Dee grabbed the rider’s crop out of Ginger’s hand and whipped her soundly across her small pert breasts.  “Uuhh,” Ginger grunted.  And as an angry red mark welted up on her milky white skin, Dee realized that the crop had already been salted.  Perfect.   Just as Dee walked into the office building, his Blackberry went off.    ***Sir, Mr. Cadbury has arrived for your afternoon appointment, Coco***  He ran his thumb along the LCD screen over Coco’s name.  FUCK!  I thought I worked this out of my system already.  He gripped his Blackberry, erased the message and threw it in his gym bag.    As he stepped off the elevator he couldn’t resist taking a quick glance at Coco.  She sat behind the monstrous desk like a queen, regal, beautiful and dangerous.  She stared intently at her monitor as she softly chewed on the licorice whip that was hanging seductively from the corner of her lips.  It was the Ce & De brand of licorice, which she took extreme liking to and it seemed to be the only thing he ever saw her eat.  Dee stood frozen in the doorway, looking at the scene.  In an attempt to get a handle on his feelings; he gave himself, especially his erection, a mental and physical shake, and walked purposely towards her.  “Coco, has Mr. Cadbury been waiting very long?” Coco jumped.  “Oh god!  Mr. Kandemhan, I didn’t see you there.  You scared me!” she said, a little shakily.   “Hhmm, I see. Did you at least offer Mr. Cadbury some sort of refreshment?” Coco looked directly up at Dee with cool indifference. “Sir,” she said pointedly, “when have I ever left a guest unattended?”  Dee wanted to grab her delicate face and squeezed it between his fingers until she whimpered, but at that moment Mr. Cadbury decided to pop his head out of Dee’s office.   “Kandemhan! Hey buddy, you planning on keeping me waiting all day?” Mr. Cadbury’s chipper mood did nothing to break the heated tension between Dee and Coco. “We will discuss this later Coco.” “Yes sir,” she said, dismissing him as quickly as he had dismissed her.  Stepping into his office with Mr. Cadbury following him, Dee was seething.  “Cadbury, where are we on the projects?” Dee asked, barely allowing his chemist to sit down before interrogating him.  “You know, Dee, you really ought to ease up on that girl.  She’s one of the few assistants you’ve had that has lasted this long….and she’s cute to boot!!”  Dee allowed very few people to address him using his first name and Cadbury wasn’t one of them, however he was too intent on getting his hands on the projects Cadbury was working on to bother correcting him.  “Mr. Cadbury, I’d appreciate it if you let me handle my own affairs. Now, show me what you have.”  Mr. Cadbury opened the box he had brought with him and pulled out two objects.  The first was seven or so licorice whips.  However, instead of the normal seven-inch straps, these were three feet long and entirely corded with braided licorice laces. It gave the sweet, distinctively flavored root a bit more girth and weight.  The other was a special treat for Necco.  Dee had gotten it made for him knowing he would protest in Dee using it on him.    “Cadbury, you are a genius! I knew there was a reason I kept you around.” “I’m here to serve Dee, erm Kandemhan.” Cadbury quickly corrected himself when Dee threw him an abhorrent glare. “Do you have anything on the handle yet?” He asked.  “Not yet,” said Dee, “however, I will be meeting with a colleague tonight who, as we speak, has the mold for it.  This will be a masterpiece!”  Cadbury simply nodded, he really didn’t care for Kandemhan’s ‘collection’.  He had done several of these types of jobs for him in the past, however this one seemed different.  Kandemhan had been incessant about getting this ‘project’ together quickly.    Cadbury stood up, looking at his watch, “Kandemhan, if you don’t mind, I really have to get going.  Let me know when you want me to start working on the handle, okay?”  Dee, who wasn’t even listening to him, merely nodded; completely submerge in his projects.  “By the way,” Cadbury whispered, “do you happen to know if Coco’s single?”  At the mention of Coco’s name Dee looked up at Cadbury and asked, “What?” “If she’s single…a good looking woman like her may be taken, I wanted to know if you knew of any men in her life.  I’m thinking of asking her out.” Cadbury smiled at Dee, that knowing smile men give each other about women.  “You will do nothing of the sort; keep your mind on the business at hand Cadbury, not on my business!” Dee spat, so angry that anyone would dare suggest such a thing.  Cadbury quickly apologized, “Geez, Dee, erm, uhh I mean Kandemhan, I’m sorry.  I had NO IDEA you two were an item.  I would never--”  “Leave, Cadbury.  You’ve overstayed your welcome.”  Cadbury stood, openmouthed, looking at Kandemhan a moment longer then turned and walked towards the double doors.  As he was about to close the door behind him, Kandemhan threw back, “Be ready tomorrow, I will obtain the handle mold tonight.  I want this project completed by tomorrow at end of business day.” Cadbury nodded, not even looking back and silently walked out.  That was it, Coco thought, sitting at her computer simultaneously writing her resignation letter, which she was planning on sending Mr. Kandemhan via his precious Blackberry, and putting her resume out on every online job board she could find.  She could take being talked down upon but not questioning the way she did her job.  She had never given him any reason to think that she couldn’t do her duties.  Well let’s see what he thinks when he doesn’t find her here in the morning.  Coco had just finished gathering her things when the doors to Kandemhan’s office opened.  She looked up and saw Mr. Cadbury; he walked past her barely giving her a nod goodbye.  She had never seen him look so stressed before; he always seemed easygoing and good-natured.  Her boss must have said something really nasty to wipe a smile off of a nice man like that.  Anyway, she thought, not my problem anymore.  I got enough money saved and I own my apartment now, so fuck him! Coco put on her sweater and her headphones and walked out of her circular office.  As she stepped out of the building, she felt slightly dejected as if she would miss something.  It’s just the money talking, Coco laughed to herself; it’s just the money.  Dee gathered up the projects in his briefcase and picked up his gym bag as he headed out of his office.  He had to see Necco to get the template for the ‘project’.  As he walked out, he began barking orders towards Coco’s direction for the next day’s agenda when he noticed she wasn’t answering.  He looked up to see her desk was empty and immaculately ordered.  She must have left for the day, he thought.  Dee frowned; he felt unsatisfied for some reason but shook it off to think about the evening’s entertainment.  Dee stepped onto his private elevator and as the doors closed he looked one last time at Coco’s desk.  Something was amiss but he couldn’t put his finger on it.  The doors of the elevator closed leaving Dee with a foreboding feeling that nagged him long after he left the building.  Necco nervously looked through the store window again.  He’s late, thought Necco dejectedly, he probably ain’t even coming.  As he turned away from the door he heard three sharp taps on the glass.  Necco quickly turned back to see Mr. Kandemhan standing outside.  He opened the door almost relieved, “Hey Mista K., I thought, well I thought you weren’t gonna make it.”    “Don’t be ridiculous Necco, did I not say I would?” Dee smiled at Necco. “You were very good to wait my little Necco, very good.”   Necco felt his heart beat faster as Dee spoke to him.  He had never been with another man before Kandehman and technically he still hasn’t “been with a man.”  Necco wasn’t allowed to touch him but Kandehman could most definitely touch him.  He wasn’t gay or nothing but Kandehman had this way of making Necco do anything he wanted.  “Do you have it, Necco?” “U-u-hh yea, it’s in the back, this way.”  Necco lead the way to the storage area of the Pink Pussycat.  The storage room was filled with open boxes of inventory that had yet to be put away.  On a tall white table in the middle of the room, there were two kangaroo leather Cat O’ Nine whips and a molding cast for the whip’s handle.  Each Nine had a herringbone handle with about seven flat braided cats.    Dee admired the beauty of the Nines, you simply cannot get anything better than kangaroo leather, he thought.    “Are these for me, my little Necco?” “Y-yea, I thought you might like `em.” “And this is the casting mold for the handle, correct?” “Yea, of course there’s no charge Mista K., cuz, you know, we’re tight like that.” Necco was looking down; he couldn’t look Kandehman in the eyes when he called him his ‘little Necco’.  When he did; he would get a killer hard on and then he’d feel …dirty but in a good way, that kind of jeans-tight-around-the-crotch dirty but good way.   “Hhmm, indeed we are, my little Necco.  These nines are truly fine specimens.  I will have to try them out soon,” he said pointedly.  Necco got nervous; he didn’t want to be whipped today.  Not here.  He looked at Kandehman, wide-eyed as if pleading with him to understand but not verbally refusing.  “Don’t worry Necco, I’ve got something else in mind for you tonight,” he said, opening his briefcase and taking out project #2.  It was a lollipop spinner.  A battery operated machine used to spin a lollipop in a child’s mouth, except this one was slightly different.  Dee had asked Cadbury to modify the toy so that it could hold a larger stemmed pop and spin it at different levels.  The one it currently held was a large version of a Charm’s lollipop.  Dee pushed a button and the bulbous head of the pop spun around slowly.   “It’s a gift I had made for you, my little Necco.  Now what do you say?” “U-u-hh, look Mista K., I’m into electro-stimulating but not this kind.  We’ve never done anything that actually…uuhh, you know….penetrated.”  The way Dee looked down at him, Necco thought Dee would hate him and he couldn’t take it. “B-but, h-hey I’ll try anything once, three times if it feels good!” Necco joked. “That’s my good little boy,” said Dee as he reached into one of the open boxes and pulled out a small bottle of AstroGlide.   “Now, let’s see how well it works, shall we?”  An hour and a half later, Dee was back in his chauffeured car.  Project #2 was surprisingly pleasing, he’d have to thank Cadbury, he thought.  Oh hell, might as well send him a quick message.  Dee rummaged through his gym bag and retrieved his Blackberry.  There was a message from Coco, which had been sent hours ago.    ***Dear Mr. Kandehman, Due to reasons that are painfully obvious, I regret to inform you that I am resigning from this position as of today.  I wish you well. Sincerely, Coco Villanueva***  Dee anger knew no bounds; it rose rapidly up his body like a flood and crashed into him over and over.  How DARE she leave him? Well, he planned to fix this situation immediately.  “Driver, I’ve changed my mind.  Take me to 30 Bogardus Place.  It’s in the Heights.”  I refuse to let you go Coco, he thought, you’re mine.  On the way to Coco’s house, Dee sent a Blackberry message to Cadbury.  He wanted him to meet him and pick up the molding cast and licorice whips and then get his final ‘project’ done this evening.  When Dee’s car pulled up to Coco’s building, Cadbury was already there. Dee handed off the items to him.  “I’d like you to deliver it here to me.” “Here?! At Coco’s place?!” “What part of my statement did you not understand Cadbury?” Cadbury sighed and nodded, “I should be done within 2 hours, give or take a few minutes, Sir.” “Very good, the apartment number is 5-A, I’ll be expecting you soon.” And with that Dee stepped into the building corridor.  He looked for her buzzer then pressed it, three sharp taps. Seconds later, her voice rose through the intercom, “Who is it?” Her voice alone incited and excited him.  “It’s Mr. Kandehman, I received your ‘letter’ of resignation and I wanted to talk to you about it, Ms. Villanueva.”  There was a long pause then she spoke again. “Okay, come up.”  The door buzzed and Dee stepped through.  The building was a renovated prewar which meant it now had elevators.  As Dee rode up he wondered what he would tell her.  His attraction for her was the main reason he hired her and was the only reason he kept her this long.  The doors opened up on the fifth floor and Dee stepped out.  He looked down the hall and saw Coco standing outside her door in a cream terrycloth robe.  “Mr. Kandemhan,” she started as Dee closed the distance between them. “I was going to call you and fully explain in the morning.” “I’d prefer if we spoke in private Coco, not in the hallway of your building,” he said warmly.  Coco felt flustered; he had never spoken that way to her before.  Maybe he came to apologize, she thought. “Of course, Mr. Kandemhan; please, come in.”  Inside Coco’s apartment Dee began to feel his excitement growing.  With every step he took into the pleasantly color Co-Op, he grew harder and harder.   “Mr. Kandemhan, would you like something to drink?” “Why, yes thank you Coco, water will do. And please, call me Dee.” He smiled.  Coco stood absolutely still for a moment looking at him smile.  She once again got the feeling that she was being preyed upon.  His smile looked, felt and smelt dangerous. “O-of course M-Mi..umm Dee.”  Coco brought Dee water and sat opposite of him in her living room.  This was her place, she thought, he couldn’t tell her what to do here.  Dee could see several emotions passing Coco’s face. Delicious, he thought.  She may not be his employee any longer, but he planned to make her an offer he felt she would not refuse.    “Coco, I understand why you resigned, truly I do.  I’m a very difficult person to work for.”  “Well, there is that, Mr. Ka…umm Dee.  But it had a lot to do with you doubting my abilities”  Dee’s concentration was completely on the deep V of Coco’s robe.  She is very buxom isn’t she? He thought.  He’s never had buxom before, only waif.  “…and not to mention domineering!” “Hhmm what?” Dee asked. “Are you even listening to me, or are you just wasting my time? Because you can leave right now!” Coco was furious.  Not only at this man but at the way her body’s had been reacting since he arrived.    “Coco, I will not apologize for anything I’ve said or done because I don’t believe I was wrong, however, I’m willing to make you an offer I think you’d like.”  He’s probably going to offer me more money, she thought.  “I’m listening.” It infuriated him that as short as she was, she could look down at him, HIM!  “I’ll act as if you never resigned, bump your salary up to $80,000 and add 20 days vacation to your time, not to mention annual discretionary bonuses.”  Coco sat there openmouthed.  What the FUCK?! She thought; that was one hell of an apology!  “If,” Coco asked.  There had to be an ‘If’ somewhere in there, she thought. “If…” Dee said, what do I want, he thought.  I want you, Coco.  He couldn’t say that. “If you would do some things for me.”   “Like what,” Coco asked suspiciously. “Cadbury is on his way here with something I had him make.  I’d like you to be the keeper of this thing and use it when I say and on whom I say.  Can you agree to that?” “But what is it? I can’t just say yes without knowing.  What if I don’t know how to use it?” “Oh my little Coco, I’m positive that you know how to use it.” With that Dee got up and offered a hand to Coco so that she stood in front of him.  “What do you have on under this robe, my little Coco?” “I-I d-don’t understand--” “Oh, but you do,” he said as he slipped a hand beneath the robe to feel the strap of her bra that he noticed earlier.  MMmm leather, nice he thought. Coco was so excited she couldn’t breathe.  She had never in her life been topped!  She had always been the one on top, but Dee made her want to try new things.  Just then the doorbell rang.  “D-Dee,” she breathed and looked questioningly at him. “It must be Cadbury, shall we let him in?” He whispered.   Dee let Coco answer the door.  Cadbury walked in, obviously uncomfortable with the fact that he may have interrupted something.  “Ah Cadbury, good to see you again,” Dee said, grinning mischievously. “Show us what you have there.”  Cadbury’s mouth fell open then snapped shut.  He looked at Coco who looked confused but interested and decided to open the box he was carrying.  From inside, he pulled out a black and red Cat O’ Nine.  Coco walked up to get a closer look.  The entire whip was made of licorice.  Beautifully crafted for pleasure and pain.  She looked up at Dee questioningly and he smiled wickedly at her as he nodded for her to pick up the whip.  Coco grabbed the handle, it felt like the real thing, she thought, and she began to feel a hot wetness gather between her legs.  She wanted to use it, but not on Dee…on someone weak.  She looked up again at Dee, letting him know she was ready.  Dee turned his attention to Cadbury.  “Well done Cadbury, well done.  Do you mind if we give it a go?”  “Whatever rocks your socks, Kandehman.” Cadbury replied. Dee looked at Coco and watched as she lifted the whip and cracked it down across Cadbury’s clothed ass.  “WHAT THE FUCK?! YOU BITCH!! NOT ON ME!” Cadbury screamed.  Coco mirrored Dee’s smile and brought the whip down again.  “Kandehman, stop this,” Cadbury pleaded.  “Cadbury, you of all people should truly enjoy this.  I know I’ve neglected you for a time, but since you’ve been so very good; you simply must be rewarded!”   Cadbury hung his head down defeated and gave Dee a weak, “Yes sir.” Dee nodded at Coco and she stepped forward again with the whip.  “Can I make him do anything I want?” She asked sweetly, caressing the handle of the whip.    “Oh yes, my little Coco, ANYTHING you want!” Dee smiled.  “WHO?” Coco demanded as she repeatedly whipped Cadbury, “WHO CAN?”  “T-t-he Cc-candyman..c-can,” Cadbury grunted.  “WHY?” “b-b-because…” he panted, “h-he m-mixes it w-with l-love a-and makes t-the w-world taste g-good!…PLEASE STOP!” Cadbury begged and fainted away on Coco’s floor.  Coco smiled and turned.  Dee had been watching all this time and his erection looked as if it would burst out of his pants.  She walked towards him with her robe open revealing her patent leather clad lingerie and asked, “Is he right? Does the Candyman really make the world taste good?”  “That he does, my little Coco,” Dee replied as he watched Coco slip the tip on one of the licorice whips into her mouth, “that he does.”",

        "blog_text": "I just finished watching 'Bowling for Columbine'.  The cover of the DVD has a review that says 'Funny'.  Yeah, I laughed; but, the they should have had a review that said 'Honest' instead. I don't want to talk about the specifics of the movie or how I'm kicking my ass for not going to see it in the ONE Columbia theater that showed it.  I knew all of the facts that were said in the movie.  I have studied poli sci, media literacy and race relations.  What I want to talk about is the one truth that was said in the movie. We are mad at nothing. I just gave Kyle my theory that the U.S. is a high roller strung out from a 20 year poker game.  We won the cold war (purposely left in lower caps, fuckers) when Ronald Reagan played history's biggest bluff known as 'Star Wars'.  We were not going to put lasers in space.  We had no intention on building this silly project.  (In fact if you ever see some old coverage of that silly speech, note the reaction on half the people's faces ... I've never seen more 'yeah, right's in my life).  It was a bluff.   Russia had built up a nuclear arsenal larger than ours.  But, really, how many times can you blow up the world?   So, we bluff that we're getting ready to build this defense system that would make nuclear weapons obsolete.  Imagine you're a Russian. 'What?  Really?  We put all of our fucking money into this goddamned arms race and they are going to make it obsolete?  Can they do that?  Yes?  Oh, shit, we're fucked.' That was it, the worlds greatest bluff ended the cold war. But, if you are America you can't just say, 'Just fucking with you.' (P.S. I'm not a Republican, but it's O.K. to admit that the other guys came up with some good ideas) Everything since that point has been a super inflated hyper active arms race to beat nobody.  Which brings me back to the poker game. We have noone to play but we are so excited that we won the 'big match' that we have been on a 20 year(ish) bender.  'Who's going to play me next?  You? You? You?'  No one has ever wanted to play. 'Fuck that. Panama, you play him.' But, we Shanghaied us a couple of apponents.  Now the rest of the spectators get nervous.  'Maybe we should punch the fucking hyper Maverick before he gets us next.'  I would. Which brings me to my big point that I wanted to say after watching this movie.  I have seen the pointless anger that is incorporated in us by a chase for goods and a lifestyle we can't ever reach.  Even those skinny blonde fucks in the ads go home to cocaine and bitchy girlfriends, people.   Wrap this up, Brent.  I wanted to share with you 2 typical Americans who are (or were) scared of the world outside. Case study #1:  When I was working at the great supermarket in high school this dude came in one day.  I was bagging his groceries and noticed he had F.T.W. tattoed on his arm.  Unlearned in the was of the angry world as I was, I asked what it meant. 'Fuck the world.' I didn't say another word.  But I kept thinking, 'Why is he so mad?' 'Fuck the world?  Fuck you!  Carry your own goddamned groceries that I just bagged for you so I can make enough money not to ask my single mother for gas money to go to school and take my fat girlfriend to a movie where I won't make out.  Fuck the world?  Buddy, I am the world.' The second was this guy from just the other day.  It was when me and R. Girl were heading out to camp.  We were driving down the interstate when all of a sudden this fucker pulls into my lane.  He ran me off the road, which, naturally, upset me.  But the guy has the nerve to look in his rearview mirror and start telling me to 'Fuck off' while giving ME the finger.  He cut ME off!  It was ME that almost died!  After a few seconds of me screaming 'I'll fuck your world' and R. Girl giving him the double bird (you know, both hands at once) did the guy calm down and realize his mistake.  He gave the 'I'm sorry' wave and as a citizen of this world I had no choice but to accept it and give the all encompassing 'It's ok, you're a good guy' tilt of the hat. Good stories.  But within them are what's wrong with this country.  Daddy hated us or we got arrested for crank possession and all of a sudden we say 'Fuck the World' every time we reach for something?  Are we so caught up on fucking others over that we don't look at our OBVIOUS mistakes and realize we were wrong.   We can't even say we're wrong.  We have to tattoo ourselves to protect our silly lifestyles that are fake and based on GAP ads anyways.   You're mad at someone for something.  Don't fuck the world. You cut me off.  Calm down.  We lived.  I flip you off, you shake your head like an idiot and we drive on. There's no need for any of this anger.  Who are we mad at?  I think ourselves.  We watch 9/11, we watch Columbine, we watch all of these things and we KNOW that it's not the kids or the Middle Easterners.  It's us.   That's why we are mad.  We cut off the world and don't want to admit we aren't as cool as we thought.  So let's all run out and tattoo our arms, right? Think about that, dorks.",

        "blog_text": "It was a Sunday night after a big televised football game on ABC.  It might've been the Superbowl even, but on that cold winter evening in 1987, my heart was instantly warmed when I saw the series premiere of 'The Wonder Years'.  The moment I laid eyes on eleven year old Fred Savage, I experienced little girl lust for the first time.  He was just the right amount of cute, clumsy, and caring that kept me tuning in Tuesday nights for many years to come.  He was from Chicago, and I was only an hour away from there, and well, we had something in common dammit!  I loved him, I loved the show, and I loved the whole idea behind celebrity and the entertainment industry.    One lazy summer day, while perusing through the latest Bop or Teen Beat magazine, I came across Fred Savage's mailing address in the back of the publication.  Keep in mind this was before the Internet, so a plethora of information on your favorite star wasn't readily available.  I thought I had hit the jackpot!  Not knowing at the time that it was most likely his talent agency's address and not his very own personal address, I immediately began writing page upon page of why I loved Fred's SHOW so much.  Even at my young age, I knew I didn't want to sound desperate, so I would NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES tell Fred how much I wanted him to come over and trade baseball cards, how I wanted him to come Pogo Ballin' with me, or how I wanted him to be my first kiss.  It was so hard for my little girl pen to refrain from writing, 'I love you so much,' or 'Can I come to Los Angeles and visit you?'    After a few drafts, and a proofread from my best friend Teresa, who also was a HUGE Fred fan, I obeyed the magazine's suggestions and included a self-addressed stamped envelope to the far away address in L.A.  I even put two stamps on the outer envelope just in case.  I made my Mom make a special trip to the post office that night, eventhough there wouldn't be another pickup until morning.  She took me anyway.    For the first few days, I was checking the mail daily.  After awhile, I just stopped looking.  How could Fred ignore my sweet attempt at wooing him over without being forward?  He's busy, not to mention I'm one of the thousands of girls from the Midwest sending him a letter. I didn't lose hope.  I 'knew' him well enough, that he wouldn't let my letter go unnoticed.  Months had passed and I had forgotten about my letter, until one day when I was fetching the mail, I noticed an envelope with handwriting on the outside that looked a lot like mine.  Ohmigosh, Fred wrote me back!  I bolted into the house, and tore open the letter to find two glossy 4x6 postcards.  One was a photo with all of the cast members of The Wonder Years with their photocopied autographs on the back.  The other was a color headshot of Fred himself in a vibrant pinkish/magenta polo shirt on a blue background.  He looked so cute.  On the back was his autograph with a line that said...crap...it's escaping me right now.  At the time, I didn't even think that a production assistant probably read my letter and stuffed my SASE with the two mass produced postcards.  I thought, Fred probably read this and ordered that I get those.  I was glowing!  Teresa was jealous, but I think shortly thereafter, she received her SASE with the two postcards as well.  The years passed, and my crush for Fred dwindled, but I still held onto those postcards.  They served as a reminder of a time when I was so innocent, so trusting in others (the entertainment industry even), and I thought anything was possible if I believed in or wanted it bad enough.  Why am I recalling all of this?  Tonight, I was contacted by Fred's agent to schedule a meeting for Fred and my boss to discuss the possibility of Fred directing an episode of our show.  He's coming tomorrow.  One o'clock.  I'm picking him up from the parking lot in the golf cart.  Will I tell him of my childhood crush I had or of the postcards that are still in my little girl bedroom at home?  Probably not.  But I will chuckle to myself as I take a corner too sharp, make Fred brace his seat in the cart, and say something funny to make him laugh.  I've gotta act like a nine-year-old for a minute or two, as I'm in L.A. where I never thought I'd be, and fucking Fred Savage is sitting next to me.  Oh, I remembered what Fred 'wrote' to me on the back of his postcard.  It said in his barely legible cursive, 'May all your years be wonder years.  Love, Fred '  They have been Fred, and they still continue to be.",

Days like today madden me, wear what little sanity I have to begin with down. Today I conversed with... my mother, my stepsister, and Bre on the phone. The Bre bit was good, we talked religion- she mentioned something about the end of the world and dragons or something, so I'm going to question that further when we next talk- hopefully this meeting will involve swings and a playground. So, yeah... I feel cut off and I need more contact than that. I'm a bloody Libra, the social butterfly of the zodiac- does no one understand this?! Alas. Well, might be going to see a local band on the 20th- hope so, get to meet this guy Bre likes and get out of the house...where there are people and it's not the mall. Hmm, I feel like my friends rarely introduce me to people they like or are dating. Probably just coincidence... but then I feel so distanced from their rants and I can't give 100% advice when they start freaking out at me.   I've watched Eddie Izzard twice in the past two days. Sad? Yes probably. But I'm learning all the lines of Dress to Kill, so everything is happy. Also sad- I'm beginning to severely miss Mainland's class. I've decided that once I get my AP test scores, regardless of the score itself, I'll bug Mainland via email- either to say 'told you so' or thank him. Those of you reading who were in his class- you're going w/ me at lunch or before/after school to visit him. He really was the best teacher (high school, I'm not dissing Mrs. Bamford or anything) I could've imagined. So, I hadn't really thought about the AP test in ages.

Yeah, today was a good day.  For the first time, I got out of clinicals and didnt want to blow my brains out or drink myself to oblivion.  No one came up to me begging to die or for me to kill them today.  We actually had a shitload of fun.  Me and Shelly (another CNA student) were lucky enough to be sent to Activity Time in the 'not-so-bad' Alzheimers unit today.  People were friendly, laughing, smiling, holding conversations, and just thrilled to have us as company.  First, we had to watch Oprah, because some of the women would get pissy if you turned off their Oprah to do activities.  So we did that until about ten.  Then we played ball for a good hour.  Its just one of those really light plastic bouncy balls that you can get at target for a couple of bucks, but the old folks were having a blast.  It was sweet.  A few went off to the other activity part where they were making brownies (special ones (just kidding)) and then the rest of us kept playing ball.  Soon, there was a crowd of people playing ball.  This one old man would whip it at everyone else, but he would bounce it, so no one ever got hit in the head.  And also there was this blind lady, and every time I would put the ball in her hands so she could play, the old man would grab it from her, and just whip it at someone else.  So anyway, the activity lady came back with a set of trivial persuit cards from probably the 60's (as there were very few I knew) and I would ask questions, and if they remembered them, they would say the answers.  So good times were had by all, and we were sad that we had to go back to the other side of the building.  So then lunch time rolled around, and there really wasnt anyone who needed helping that I hadnt had yet, so I waited and was just walking around, talking to those who could respond to me, and I helped one of my favorite residents to walk around the hallways for exercise.

        "blog_text": "Hiphop is in a state of chaos, people! I kind of always knew that, but ignored it when I was introduced to a new song with killer beats and a monster hook. Recently though, something has really got my mind marinating on some major happenings. I give hiphop another ten years before its demise unless new artists seriously reconstruct this game.   I was having trouble with this Eminem thing. For those of you who aren't privy, Eminem was accused of being racist. The accusation was mostly given by Source magazine co-owner and wannabe-rapper, Benzino. This was a long time coming, because apparently, Benzino had problems with Eminem ever since he became a mainstream act. This just happened to be the first time he had some kind of evidence backing up his claims.   Long before Eminem was with D-12, he was with some another rap group which consisted only of White men. He was in his teens to early twenties at the time. The group recorded a song called 'Foolish Pride' where Eminem is rapping about the pros of dating White women and the cons of dating Black women. He accused Black women of being gold-diggers and repeatedly mentioned White women as 'good' and Black women as 'bad.' A recording of the song got released. People were playing parts of it on the radio and the song was sold on many mixtapes. It seemed as though Benzino may have not fallen completely off the mark. But the racist hype quickly died. Mostly because Benzino doesn't have nearly as much respect in the rap community as Eminem.  Now, as many of those who know me are aware, I simply adore Eminem. Being a writer/poet myself, I can't deny his skills as a lyricist. His use of metaphor and grasp of Standard American English is outstanding. His rhythms, the complexity of his rhyme patterns, styles, cadences, and syllable positioning are beyond debate. You can't compare him to anybody else in the rap game at this time. There are other impressive rappers out there, but Eminem's mastery with words has no parallel.  I had a definite problem with the whole racist accusation. I was straight up confused. What was his motive? What did this mean for hiphop? I had heard all the hype, but hadn't heard any defense from Eminem. I felt as though he didn't care what the Black community thought because he knew his fanbase was largely White. Black folks buy the bootlegs, but the White kids were the ones buying his albums and going to his concerts. They were putting money in his pocket; not us. So, shit, why should he care?  I was at the mall one day and there was a vendor selling bootlegs. He had a mixtape with 'Foolish Pride' on it. I listened to the song and almost fell over with laughter. The song is a heart-attack-serious joke! It's horrible! You could tell these were the rantings of a child. The rhymes were sloppy and the melody was bleak. Nothing about this song seemed comparable to the Eminem we know today. I had to let it go.  I didn't let it go because the song was acceptable. I let it go because it taught me a very valuable lesson. Somewhere along the line I forgot that Eminem is White. That, or I somehow began to believe that he was above such commentary. When we're young, we all say stupid, ill-informed things. You're going to tell me that none of my Caucasian friends ever made a negative comment about Negroids when in their own company? Hell, they made enough ignorant comments right in front of my face! But, you know what? They forgot I'm Black! They felt so comfortable with me that I was considered 'different.' I know this because these are things I've actually been told. 'I don't consider you Black,' 'But you're not like that, you're different,' 'I know you're not going to beat me over the head with a baseball bat for no reason.' The last quote was seriously said straight to my face; his arm around my shoulder. The comment is definitely offensive, but the point is: people do it.   Can I call them racist? Probably at the time. Maybe, maybe not. It's hard to say when they're your friends. I admit to telling a great many jokes/cracks exploiting White stereotypes. Am I racist? We're all dumbasses sometimes, especially if we think we're in a safe place. That's what the nineteen-year-old M&M was thinking. Is it fair to hold a thirty-something-year-old man accountable for the ill-mannered things spewed in his teens?  My biggest reason for overlooking 'Foolish Pride' was probably based on the mere fact that I don't know Marshall Mathers in the least. All I do know is that I admire Eminem as an artist. I wanted to be able to listen to his music and still respect myself. You don't have to agree with people personally in order to enjoy their creativity. So, like most R. Kelly fans, I turned the other check. I decided to mind my own business when it came to Eminem's mind, motives, and actions.",

I let it go because I realized I don't know Eminem personally and that holding him eternally accountable for mistakes made as a teenager misses the complexity of growth and human error. I chose to focus on his creative achievements rather than his youthful missteps so I could keep enjoying the music I love without compromising my own integrity.",

        "blog_text": "Hmmm. Im not deserving of this life im given. Im wasting this gift by making bad choices and doing wrongs to my 'friends'. The mere fact that i have friends still puzzles me. The fact that they read this, and ask me if im alright is something that i dont understand. Why do they care, why does it matter to them that i feel the way i do. I dont understand what makes them worry or what makes them fret over the bendable words that are written out in this journal. Why does it interest people to delve into my life, as they attempt to understand how i 'tick'. I hate clocks, but i love noise. Time isnt real. I hate the fact that people think you can travel through time, or stop time. Time is just a way to keep track of the decay of carbon based life forms. If you could go back in time, then whenever you accomplished what you set out to do would be completed in the future, and you would have no reason to go back in the first place. If you stopped time, everything would stop moving. Even atoms, hence, you would be imprisoned in a motionless universe. You would suffocate because you wouldnt be able to breathe, better yet move at all. And if you could go into the future, to see what will come to pass, you would then realize that whatever you did in the present didnt matter, because regardless of the 'choices' you would make, it would all lead to the future you saw, leaving you to wonder if you are actually living your life at all, or if you are just a puppet being dragged along by the ever present flow of time. You wouldnt have control of your destiny. Anyways, ive been wondering why i put my 'friends' in the awkward and often times bothersome positions i put them in. I know what causes it, but i cant help it. I need to do these things. But i hate that i cant fulfill that need without hurting someone close to me. I wonder how the lives of my friends would be different, mostly i think of how they would be better if we never had met. How the experiences and provocations i put them through have altered their lives, and how they would be if i had never done those things. I also wonder if when i die, that perhaps the world ceases to exist. That maybe, this world, is dependent on my existence, that the people i know, the places i see are all parts of me, and that when i come to the end of my life, that maybe this world stops. Maybe this world would just vanish, disappear, or if it would just carry on like it seems to when anybody dies. I cant see through somebody else's conciousness, which is why i think that maybe the things i see are here for me, and made by me. Its foolish. I wonder what the world would be like if i werent alive tomorrow. I wonder if anyone would notice, and if they noticed if they would care, and if they cared if they would remember, and if they remembered would they mourn. If the world keeps spinning after i die, then i wonder what the point of it all was. Ive made little positive impact on the lives of others. I wish i was a better friend. I wish that i am a better friend. I wish that i will be a better friend. If i could, i would go back and fix my mistakes, if i could i would stop the world spinning so i could end the mistakes im making, and if i could i would go to the future and see how ive grown. But i cant. Im here now, only now, never anywhere else. I may never be as good as i think i need to be to completely fulfill what is deserved of my friends as a person, but perhaps ill reach something that is close. Im sorry to those of you who ive made uncomfortable, those of you ive made worry, those of you who ive forced conversation out of. I apologize, it wont happen again. Ill see to that. Time. Time marches on. Time sucks ass. There's not enough time in the world to describe how much my 'friends' mean to me. Not enough time to tell them that they've done too much. Not enough time to let them know how sorry i am. Either way, its time for me to stop. Its time to better myself. And its time for change.

I know for certain this questioning will not lead to a complete overhaul of what I know and understand to be true but, God willing, it will lead to a deeper knowledge and understanding of who I am, and what my motivations are- particularly in the 'religious' sense.  The other night trying to fall asleep I found myself restless....kept awake by the idea that I'm a cheater, that I'm insincere, that my attempt at a spiritual life is being kept alive by nothing more than self-motivation and ego.  I began to ask myself - 'Why do I make attempts to worship God in the Orthodox Church?'  Is it the need to feel superior to the 'other half' who live without the Church. Is it a feeling of belonging which drives me? Is it a psychological need, possibly stemming from  my personal experiences, which has led me to attempt feebly to approach God?Is it a desire for some kind of mystical experience which will deliver me from the monotony of day to day life?  Is it the fear of death and final judgement? Do I only call on God in times of need- reducing God to a wish-giver of sorts? Is my religion a  crutch ?  If these things are true... then my Christianity is fake- it is a thin and cheap facade only existing to satisfy myself, not God.  If this is true, then perhaps the critics of 'organized religion' are correct, at least about me and my ego driven self-satisfying motivations.  My former priest used to say frequently:  'We must become less, so that He may become more.'   Is my Christianity an emptying of the self, or is it pleasing to the self in its comforting concepts, its ritual, its talk of Church life which foster feelings of self-importance.

        "blog_text": "This is an post  that has been a long time coming for us.        This story is all about  my niece, Savannah.  She was born August 28, 2000, with a disease called Citrullinemia.  At the time she was the first and only living person in NC with this disease.  Now she is the oldest of 3 in this state.  Her parents are Stan and Renee Loftis, Stan is my sister Marlena's youngest son.  On May 6,1998, they had twin boys,  Zach and Luke , unfortunately  had this same disease, but it was unknown at the time.  Zach passed away on May 13, Luke on May 14.  It was a tough decision for Stan and Renee to have another child.  But with only a 25% chance of the child having the disease, they went ahead.  Prenatal testing told them midway thru pregnancy that Savannah did indeed have Citrullinemia.  But that didn't matter, they loved their unborn child no matter what and were willing to make the life sacrifices to give her life, and love her for however long God let them.      They have been thru many ups and downs, more hospitalizations than you can count.  Savannah cannot have one bite of food, one sip of drink, without it being weighed and measured to the exact tenth of a gram.  They have a book listing protein counts in a lot of different foods.  If the food isn't listed, she can't have it.        Imagine being a child and not being able to eat an ice cream cone because the protein count is too high for your system.  Or not being able to eat a candy bar.  Going to a baseball game and not being able to taste a hot dog.  Savannah loves pizza, but can't have it.  She loves  peanut butter , but the special peanut butter her mom orders for her is $8.00 for a 16 oz jar.  Her all-time favorite I think is chocolate.  Did you know  one Hershey's kiss has .4 grams of protein.  When you are only allowed a total of 6 grams a day, you can't really afford to eat one Hershey's kiss.       Right now, Savannah will never be able to go to public school, or have children of her own.  This disease has total control of her life.  She has a portacath in her chest for easy access for lab work and IV meds which are often needed.  She has a stomach tube for the many feedings of special formula, and medication. Her main doctor is in Chapel Hill NC, her mom is on the phone almost on a daily basis either with the nurses, or doctors or nutrition specialist, you name it, they are conversing.  It is all a very stressful life.  Renee has to be 'on' 24/7, she has had to educate herself on this disease, so she can educate the doctors around Savannah that don't have a clue what they are dealing with.  Simple things like going on vacation takes days to prepare the medicines, formulas, scales, foods, etc that have to go wherever Savannah goes.  They can't just decide to go spend the day at the park.  Every thing has to revolve around medication time tables.  every nuance about Savannah is watched, noted.  If she sleeps longer today than yesterday.  How many times has she stumbled today, has she played with anyone who is sick.  I don't know how many church services they have had to leave because someone there had a cold and that puts Savannah at risk.  A cold usually means a hospital stay.  A stomach virus could mean death.  This is not the life of a normal little girl. But she is still the most precious, lively, rambunctious, loving little girl you can ever meet.     The only cure for this disease is a liver transplant.  Next month, Savannah starts the work up for her liver transplant.  They found out last week that Renee is a match.  Her work up will begin as soon as possible after Savannah is cleared.        I am writing all of this to ask each of you to pray for them.  Stan only has one week of vacation left so Renee and Savannah are going to need a lot of support down in Chapel Hill.  All of us close to them are willing and ready to move there if we have too.  But we need you to pray.  This is a huge decision, and a huge life changing thing.  Please pray that God will see them thru this , and the outcome would be a healthy little girl, and a healthy mom to enjoy watching her daughter grow up.       I know Renee has put a  donation link on Savannah's page.  It is going to take a lot of money for this to happen.  Her operation itself is covered by insurance, but insurance doesn't cover motel bills,food,parking, gas for the 5 hour drive on way to the hospital from home,and sure doesn't cover the cost of Stan missing work to be with his wife and child.  I know anything anyone can donate will be much appreciated.  They are a one income family, with two children they are raising.  So Stan has to work no matter what is going on.        But please more than anything, pray, pray hard, and keep praying.",

He'll be operating a loader for them and the job should last until it is too cold to dig and lay pipe! Yes!! Yippee!!    For over three years Mark and I have planned on the day we would sell our extraneous belongings and move into the motorhome fulltime. Never in our wildest dreams did we think we would both have medical setbacks at the same time which would require us to be off work for several months...and then for bad weather and a poor job market to leave us unemployed for a couple months beyond our normal winter 'down time'.   But this is exactly what happened to us! We both made it nearly to the end of last year's work season, but Mark was so sick with lung problems (for a while there we were both very worried about his condition!), and I ended up having a complete hysterectomy.  We are both much better now, but for a while there it was looking pretty bleak.   But one day has made the difference. We've reached a turn-around point. Mark is going back to work, and I should be getting a call from the Union any day now to go back to work myself. Hopefully, we will both be able to work until early winter and earn enough to replace our lost savings, and buy a few 'goodies' we wanted for the motorhome and our travels.

Second, I'm also a writer which means I would rather express myself and my thoughts on the written page instead of face-to-face. I'm no good at talking about things. I need time to think about what I want to say. I find myself editing my thoughts before saying anything. I'm also trying to speak like I write.  Third, I am socially awkward because I've had very little practice. I was never the most popular person and never sought the spotlight. It comes from being a Taurus. I like being sturdy, dependable and hardworking. Fanfare and the spotlight mean little to me. As a result, I'm not very good at showcasing myself in social situations. I never talk myself up. I prefer actions to words. People talk about what they are like or what they would do but never seem to do what they say. It goes back to not grabbing the spotlight. I'd rather people discover what kind of a good person I am on their own through things I do rather than me pointing it out to them. It feels like an act of desperation. 'Look at me, look what I can do. I'm a good person and here are the reasons why...' It's not me.  But realizing I am shy, I do have to work on coming out of my shell a bit more at times. D had a point the other night. I did want to say something and should have been a little more forward but old habits held me in check.  Meeting someone has always been my biggest problem because of my shyness. Those who suffer from it will understand when I say I wish I could get past the initial stages and move right into a relationship. I'm great once into a relationship, it's getting started that is a problem. Everyone is a little scared of opening up to someone they hardly know, but for someone who is shy, opening up is twice as hard. Not only is there the normal fear of being around someone new but there is that constant habit of closing up and hiding in our shells.  I admit part of being shy is a defense mechanism. Keeping to oneself doesn't require risk. I admitted on my list of 100 things about me that I have not seriously dated in almost eight years. I'm not ashamed to admit it. People may ask how I could live that long without dating. It's actually very easy for the most part. Shy people are very introverted and are comfortable with themselves and their world. Those who are not introverted spending time with themselves is scary. I know people who can't be alone for more than a few moments at a time. They are in constant need of company. Doing things alone scares the crap out of them. For the introvert, alone time is the best time. I can go days without seeing another living being. Depending on my mood I'd prefer not to see another living soul.  Striking a balance between needing other people around and hiding away is the challenge. I believe I'm making pretty good progress with crawling out from under my rock a little more often. I'm at least aware of my introverted self taking over. I know when I'm starting to recede back into my shell. If I can identify those times when I'm doing that, I'll have a better chance of changing how I handle myself.  I think it all has to do with fear. Introverted people have a lot of fear. I'm not saying it's bad or we're screwed up but it's a fact we have a deep-seeded fear we may not even be completely aware of that prevents us from taking that one bold step. I remember a time when I had a swagger in my step. I wasn't afraid of speaking my mind. I didn't take a risk. Somewhere I lost that side of my personality. I know a lot of it is connected to experiences through high school and college.  I have done a good job at hiding my introverted ways. I've learned how to mask my shyness. I used to be outgoing and I'm pretty good at faking it. When I go out with friends I seem to be the life of the party at times. At the bar, I'm usually loud and storm the dance floor like someone possessed. What nobody realizes is being loud and the crazed party guy doesn't require me to open up to anyone. I'm like a tornado, there's nothing in the middle and everything whirls around the outer edge. And while I'm having a good time, I'm not meeting anyone. I don't form friendships (except with Sheri who made more of an effort than I did), I form acquaintances.   I couldn't hide from D. She quickly discovered I carry a shell around with me. But here's where it gets interesting. I know D has a shell of her own.  The question will be if we are able to come out of those shells long enough to find each other. I know once we do find each other, we won't have a problem being like-minded people. But until then it will be the blind leading the blind.  For someone who is shy, I write a lot don't I?  Several hours later....  Tampa Bay is leading the Flyers 2-0 and I'm waiting for the Calgary game to come on.  I found out my brilliant plan for D's birthday isn't going to work because she's not going to be in town. The timeline has been moved up to tomorrow. Everyone wish me luck.  I went shopping today and bought a couple pairs of pants, a shirt, a belt and a pair of shoes. It's a birthday present to myself. I haven't bought any new clothes in a long time and the experience was frustrating. I'm no shopper and having to sift through racks of clothes is one of the scariest things I can think of doing. I got through it and I'm happy with how well I did. I'll be on the front of GQ in no time.",

        "blog_text": "I did not get out of the internet cafe until about 0025 last night (or this morning, actually), which was good, considering that the chow hall closes at 0030. I did not notice the time until 0020, because I was so enthralled in the process of making my laptop act nice. Now this is a story. About 4 days ago, I finally got fed up with having my hard drive in two partitions. Partitions are not necessarily a bad thing, but my laptop came factory with a 10 GB hard drive with a 2.35 GB partition storing a drive image of the hard drive as it came from the factory, with Windows Me, Office 2000, McAfee Virus Scan 6, and everything else that it had from factory. This was necessary, since it did not come with everything on CD. What was not necessary was its size, as the image is only a 1.65 GB file. This left with 700 MB of free space on that partition. That would have worked out alright if it was large enough to use as a temporary folder for burning CD's, however, for some reason I need 1 GB of free space to burn a CD. This resulted in my having to move a lot of files around in order to burn a CD, which was a real pain in the neck. My first idea was to burn the drive image to a couple of CD's, delete the files, and use Ranish Partition Manager to make one large, single partition on my disk. A little thought in this area made me see that I did not want to waste 3 CD-R's burning an image of old software, when I have Windows XP, Office XP, Norton Anti-virus 2002, and other newer versions of the software I use. I then decided to repartition and reformat the drive, install Windows XP and only the software I need, and then burn a drive image of that configuration while it was as pure as the driven snow. I had no idea of the problems it would cause. The first problem I ran into was that my DVD decoder software, while functional after upgrading Windows XP over Windows Me, would not install at all onto a Windows XP machine. The second and most unnerving problem arose when I attempted to activate this new installation of Windows XP. I ran the activation wizard as usual, only after it connected to the internet, it displayed a screen the likes of which I have never seen. I don't remember everything it said verbatim, but I clearly recall the first line of the page. 'According to our records, the number of times you can activate Windows with this product key has been exceeded.' It then asked me to input a different product key in the box below it. It did have a button underneath that said 'Activate by telephone'. Upon clicking this button, I see that it has a toll-free number to call from if you are in the United States. Below this, it said to select what country you are in to get an alternate number, and it had a drop-down combo box beside that. Being that I am currently in Baghdad and a 800 number would still cost me 50 cents per minute. I knew that they would have me on hold for a while before I started the inevitable lengthy process. I immediately started drafting an e-mail to send to Microsoft to express my dismay. The following is a copy of that e-mail. What the hell is this?!!! I cannot believe my eyes. 'According to our records, the number of times you can activate Windows with this product key has been exceeded.' What kind of slimy, dishonorable, communist, twinkle-toes, morally depraved BS is this?!!! I am appalled. What in the hell are you bastards trying to do, take every last dime you possibly can get your grubby little hands on? Do you really expect me to buy another copy of Windows? I must inform you money-loving heathens: ACCORDING TO OUR RECORDS, THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU CAN OVERCHARGE ME FOR A BUGGY, BLOATED, INFERIOR, OBSOLETE, WORTHLESS, UNSTABLE PIECE OF SOFTWARE HAS BEEN EXCEEDED. Who the hell do you think you are?!!! This is about as American as the Taj Mahal! I would call and try to activate windows by telephone, but I am currently honorably serving in my beloved country's armed forces in Baghdad, Iraq. I don't think I need to explain to you how expensive it would be for me to call you disreputable miscreants, especially since I know you will have me on hold for an hour with all the other VICTIMS of your evil, despicable, tyrannical regime. YOU DON'T HAVE A TOLL-FREE NUMBER FOR IRAQ, DO YOU, YOU GREEDY ARROGANT COLD-HEARTED BASTARDS?!!! No, of course not. Why not screw over the very people that are fighting and dying for your protection? For your liberty? For your right to rape the local economy of every last shred of decency it has left? NO! I DRAW THE LINE THERE! YOU SORRY, NO COUNT, VILE, CRUDE, CALLOUS, INSOLENT HOOLIGANS CAN KISS MY HAIRY WHITE BUTT. I don't expect a reply from you morons. I'm not worried about it. But I'm also not giving you one more cent. I never really needed to pay you anything, but I did it out of decency. Things have changed. What little respect I had for your organization just went out the window. I will now go online and get one of the countless cracks that are available to bypass your 'activation.' What I am upset with most is the fact that I am being forced to go out of my way to solve a problem that arose simply due to my periodic reinstallation of Windows. If you are going to have this fascist stonewall in place, either warn users before the installation, or make your operating system capable of running for more than 6 months without swelling to rob nearly 3GB of my limited storage. Those of us with 9.35GB laptop HDD's (It's 10GB raw...you ****s) can't take this. After venting a little steam, I went to Microsoft's website to find an e-mail address. I went to the support page, and clicked on 'Contact Us'. What I ran into amazed me. I understood the first screen that said that if your copy of Windows came with your computer, you would have to contact your system manufacturer. Since my copy of Windows XP came from HP, I was concerned. I did not want to contact HP, I wanted to scream at Microsoft. I hate Microsoft. I like HP. I've owned HP computers and peripherals in the past, and I currently own a laptop, desktop, and external CR-RW drive from HP. I've rarely had a problem with anything, but when I have, HP fixed it rather quickly, and in the case of this laptop, every time I've turned it in for service, they've changed out more than I had problems with and upgraded it for free. Faster processors and the DVD-ROM were nice, but a new battery and hard drive that they did not have to change was really nice. Anyway, since my copy of Windows came in the mail separate from the laptop, I figured I was good. Ignoring that screen, I continued to the e-mail tab. It did not simply show you an address, but asked me to input my product ID. It said that if your product ID contained 'OEM', Windows came with your computer. Mine did. I put it in anyway. The next screen told me to contact HP. I could not even get an e-mail address from them. I've bought several versions of Windows and other things from Microsoft, I should be entitled to an e-mail address to send hate mail. I ended up posting this rant to their message boards because that was the only way I could send them anything. Their message board is not read by technicians at Microsoft, it is just a place to post a question. If someone else is reading it (usually because they are posting a question) and they know the answer or just want to say something else on that topic, they can post a response. It is a good way of finding out how to do things, but it would not solve my problem. I just wanted someone else to read it. I had already decided that I would just install a copy of Windows XP Professional Edition that I acquired through a site license. Site licensed software does not have to be activated. It is purchased by a company to install on all of their computers, and they can make as many copies as they need in order to install it on those computers. The US Army happens to have one of those licenses, and since I use this computer for Army stuff mainly, I have no problem using it. Just when I had convinced myself to go about things this way, I received a startling e-mail from HP. Apparently, someone at HP had run across my little temper tantrum and invited me to go to HP's support webpage for a live chat session with a technician. A copy of the Chat transcript follows: Paul Hello Anthony Welcome to HP Total Care for Compaq Products. My Name is Paul. How may I assist you? Anthony Whittington First, some background Anthony Whittington I received this computer through the eArmyU program. It originally came with Windows Me installed on it, but in the box was a card that said to go to Compaq's website, and you could request a free upgrade to XP. I did that, and everything was OK. Anthony Whittington The problem arose when I turned my computer in for servicing. Anthony Whittington They installed a new HD and put a DVD-ROM in it. Paul Okay Paul Listening carefully... Anthony Whittington The first problem was in trying to Activate XP when I reinstalled it. I used the Product Key off of the Certificate of Authenticity on the bottom of the computer, but there was an error message saying that 'The number of times you can activate Windows with this product key has been exceeded. Anthony Whittington I would call, but I am currently deployed in Baghdad Anthony Whittington That would be an expensive phone call Anthony Whittington The second issue is in getting a DVD Video Decoder. Anthony Whittington The one on the driver webpage is for Me. Anthony Whittington BTW, my computer was originally a 1200ta, but now it comes up as a 12XL300 Anthony Whittington Any help? Paul First, Thanks for explaining things clearly. Paul Second problem has the solution Paul ..immediately. Anthony Whittington You're welcome Paul I will provide the DVD decoder download for windows xp now. Paul Just a minute...

Paul This link gives, Intervideo Win DVD player Paul You are most welcome. Paul Checking on the first problem. Paul I understand that windows xp was installed by you and used and had no problems. When it went to service center and came back it displays such error . Paul ..about the product key. Paul Am I right? Paul or Paul Is there any modification on this? Anthony Whittington yes Paul Fine, .. Anthony Whittington I'm sorry, I was having difficulty understanding for a bit. Paul Consulting my supervisor on this product key error. Paul Are you able to use the software and the other programs in the computer? Anthony Whittington I can use everything fine. I just cannot activate Windows. I keep getting the '26 days left for activation' bubble. Paul I see.. Paul Now I got it.. Paul Please verify this: Paul Click Start > Click Help and support> Note whether it says compaq help and support or just 'Help and Support'? Anthony Whittington It does not say 'Compaq.' I did a complete reinstallation inadvertently. Anthony Whittington ...Instead of installing XP over Me. Anthony Whittington I failed to realize what I would lose when I did this. Paul I see, This could be the problem. If the Retail OS CD is used and installed (windows xp) then it will ask for a activation code which can only be obtained from Microsoft. This might have been installed in service center too. So the only solution is to contact the retailer (if they had installed this) and get the Activation code from Microsoft. Anthony Whittington I did not buy a retail version of Windows. I used to XP upgrade CD I received from Compaq/HP. Paul In the CD case what is mentioned: Is it mentioned as windows xp CD key? At this point, I was typing a response when the internet connection was lost. I immediately went back to the chat page to continue. After waiting for a while to get on, I was connected with Jeff. Jeff Hello Anthony. Jeff Welcome to HP Total Care for Compaq products. My name is Jeff. How may I help you today? Anthony Whittington Hello? Anthony Whittington I was just disconnected from a chat session with Paul. Jeff Could you please give me a couple of moments to check with your previous chat correspondence? Anthony Whittington OK Jeff . Anthony Whittington .. Anthony Whittington ... _ _ _ ... Jeff Anthony, I'm still reviewing your previous chat session. Please stay with me. Anthony Whittington Sure thing, boss. Jeff Thanks for your time and patience. Jeff Please proceed with your inquiry. Anthony Whittington What I was typing when he hung up was this: Anthony Whittington It did not come in a CD case. It came in a box. Jeff Anthony, to resolve the activation issue, please perform the following steps: Anthony Whittington The box contained a Windows XP Home Edition OEM upgrade disc, Presario Enhancements for XP disc, Norton Antivirus 2002, a small pamphlet, and a COA decal which I affixed, as directed by the small pamphlet, to the bottom of the computer next to the Me COA Anthony Whittington I'm sorry that I type slow Jeff Anthony, are you ready to perform the steps? Anthony Whittington yes Jeff 1. Click Start, Run. Anthony Whittington done Jeff Type: oobe/msoobe /a Anthony Whittington done Jeff Anthony, now restart your computer to take effect. Anthony Whittington What will I need to do when it boots back up? Jeff Anthony, after restarting you will not get the activation message. Anthony Whittington Will it continue to function after the 30 days are up? Jeff Yes, Anthony. Anthony Whittington Thank you very much. Jeff Is there anything else I can do for you now? Jeff Please contact us again if you require any further assistance. Jeff Thank you for using HP Total Care and providing us an opportunity to serve you through Chat Support. A copy of our chat session will be e-mailed to you shortly. Jeff Bye and take care. Anthony Whittington Thank you again So after a few days of bad mouthing Microsoft, HP came to the rescue.

        "blog_text": "Where have all the protesters gone? \nBy JEFF DONN Associated Press Writer \nMay 26, 2003, 4:53 PM EDT \nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The war is over in Iraq, but Reyko Shiraishi's heart is not at peace. \nOutwardly, things are much the same in her life as before the war. No more anti-war vigils, forums, or protests. She has returned to her gardening and quiet routines of retirement. \nBut sadness again darkens the eyes of Shiraishi, 73, of Brookline, who spent 3 years in American internment camps for Japanese Americans during World War II. Like many who objected to this latest war, she carries away a sense of failure _ protests didn't prevent the fighting _ and dejection over hardships in post-war Iraq. \n'I feel so discouraged by what our country has done,' said Shiraishi, a former schoolteacher. 'We `won the war,' but I personally feel defeated.' \nEarlier this year, hundreds of thousands of Iraq war opponents like Shiraishi hoisted signs, waved banners, marched, and blocked streets and federal offices in dozens of American cities coast to coast. It was the widest outpouring of domestic protest since the Vietnam war. \nSince early April, when American forces took control of Baghdad, the booming voice of protest has subsided to a murmur. \nWhat has become of the peace movement? Did protesters come to see the war as more justified when they learned more of Saddam Hussein's oppression? Did the relatively easy victory relieve their fears of military and civilian casualties? \nThe short answer is that minds were not changed, according to an Associated Press sampling of war opponents' postwar views. \nThe AP spoke with 20 people from Maine to California who had opposed the war, from protest leaders to objectors who never went to a single demonstration. Included was a panel discussion at the regional headquarters of the American Friends Service Committee, an arm of the pacifist Quaker church, in Cambridge. The interviews did not represent a scientific survey sample. \nIn their comments, the interviewees struck some common themes. Many profess to feel personally changed by the war, which they view as a history-making act of aggression, a brutish projection of American military and corporate might, and an embarrassing flouting of international opinion. \nMany acknowledge feeling powerlessness and weariness after standing up against a military campaign that rolled over both Iraqi defenses and the anti-war movement. However, many are already rechanneling their energy into other social causes or party politics, often with a mind to unseating President Bush in next year's election. \n'Has my passion diminished? It's not focused in the same direction. I would say it's focused on the next election and regime change at home,' said Donna Francescani, 35, a lawyer in Bethesda, Md. \nShe has begun attending campaign events for Sen. John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat. He hasn't taken the strongest anti-war stand of all presidential candidates, but his big asset, in her mind, is simply that she thinks he can beat Bush. \nSome of the calm on the anti-war front is perhaps natural. The immediate crisis seems to have passed. Many peace activists had been driving themselves hard since the September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. They simply needed a break. \nGordon Clark was sometimes putting in 50-hour weeks, or more, as national coordinator of the Iraq Pledge of Resistance. Last week, he was vacationing in California with his wife. 'One of the things that I've tried to do as much as possible during vacation is ignore current events,' he said. \nMany who opposed the war have paused to take stock of themselves and consider new directions for their activism. Joseph Gerson, programs director at American Friends Service Committee in Cambridge, said he feels 'a profound and internalized sadness' over what has happened. \nAnnie Bartos, 25, a coordinator for the Boston-area United for Justice with Peace, was left with a deeper cynicism about government. 'They're not listening, and it's getting harder to stay optimistic,' she said. \nYet the explosive growth of the peace movement earlier this year is a consolation to the war's opponents. Anna Hendricks, a 21-year-old Cambridge dance teacher, said the war gave her the chance to connect with activists from the Vietnam and other eras. \nPeace Action, a large national group, has launched a Campaign for a New Foreign Policy, refocusing on international human rights, arms control, and cooperation. It has also joined in placing get-out-the-vote ads in advance of the presidential election. \n'It may be quieter out there, but the groups aren't fading away. They're looking toward the future,' said Scott Lynch, a spokesman for Peace Action. \nIn Montpelier, Vt., Andrea Stander, 50, who works for an arts group, has contacted the presidential campaign of former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, a Democrat. She is attracted by his opposition to the war. 'I certainly have a greater sense of urgency. I feel that we are facing an unprecedented crisis, at least in my lifetime,' she said. \nLouis Schwartz, 38, who teaches film studies at the University of Iowa, wants to develop video projects that could be used by activist groups, perhaps on what he sees as threats to civil rights. 'It's reminded me of how important it is to me to be political active, something frankly that ... I had forgotten,' he said. \nMany war opponents have kept abreast of Iraq's occupation, too, and say the United States should turn over control to the United Nations or an international coalition. Many find vindication for their anti-war stance in what they see as a country unhinged, transformed into the Wild West of the Middle East, racked by misery and disease. \n'They haven't done anything to relieve suffering. All they've done is create more,' said painter Linda Hanson, 61, of Alameda, Calif. 'I've never been ashamed to be an American before. I feel a lot of that now.' \nFrances H. Jarvis, a staffer at American Friends Service Committee, finds other justification for her anti-war stand in the occupation: 'The lack of proof that weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq confirms my belief that the war was built on lies.' \nHowever, the opposition of Wayne Carrington, a publisher's representative in Oneonta, N.Y., would soften if such weapons turned up in considerable numbers.

        "blog_text": "a long overdue confession   over the past few weeks i have realized that more and more LCCers have been reading this blog.  friends, your presence has warmed my heart and the resulting thaw has flowered forth in confession.  first, i would like to apologize for the way that i treated you during our four years together. i realize that my attitude often suggested a superiority complex and my psuedo-intellectual interests often smelled like snobbery, but neither my attitude nor my apparent snobbery were intentional.  rather, these unsavory elements of my character were products of my fear of vocational transition as well as a deep seated-sense of inadequacy.  i harbored such a deep passion for self-identification that i was often uninterested in identifying with the group.  so in the process of trying to find myself, i alienated myself from my community...and suffered as a result.    second, i would like to share with you a snapshot of the journey that saved my life.  on my senior year 'week of e' and for the summer following graduation i served as an assistant with the l'arche daybreak community of toronto, canada. though my time at l'arche taught me many things, the most important lesson that i learned was that everyone, from my non-verbal housemate michael to my staunchest enemies (it probably will not be hard for you to believe that i have always had a few) have a gift to give.  each life, insofar as it is created in the image of God, has overwhelming value.  l'arche taught me that my role as an assistant was to be a midwife to the core members, as i assisted them in giving birth to their own identity and their own unique giftedness.  in the end, i realized that they (especially michael) were midwives to me.  i left l'arche with a true sense of my identity as a servant of christ, but, more importantly, i left there with the understanding that every person has an irreplaceable gift to give to the community.  moreover, to fail to recognize and to celebrate that gift is to fail to love our Creator God.  third, and most importantly, i have specific apologies to make:  jaimie, i am sorry for my uncritical rejection and, at times, condemnation of you.  i thought that loyalty to my friend required me to condemn you.  this was not an expectation he placed upon our friendship, but my ignorant assumption.  i was so wrong.  because of my blindness i failed to see the gifts that you brought to our community.  please forgive me.  wentz, i was rather jealous of you.  you walked into our community during my sophomore year and were immediately recognized as the man of character and wisdom that you are.  for some foolish reason i thought 'success' for me would eventually lead to competition with you.  nothing could be further from the truth.  i have since realized that competition is not a christian virtue, but a heinous vice.  i am sorry that i let such faulty thinking stand in the way of getting to know you.  i am also sorry for trying to dash your innate sense of mystery and wonder.  if i remember correctly, and it was sin--so chances are quite good that i do, there was an occasion on which you pointed out to me the intricate beauty of one of the earthworms that liked to call our sidewalks home.  i didn't respond to your reflection but rejoiced in stomping the earthworm into oblivion, as if such an action would quench the quirky wonder that characterizes your spirit.  that was incredibly foolish...st. francis would have been ashamed of my action and i am as well.  please forgive me.  em-em, you probably don't read this, but it needs to be said anyhow.  i am sorry for the way things played out between us. i had every intention to treat you like a younger sister, with absolute purity, but i failed more often than not.  if i could only change one thing about our friendship, which meant more to me that my year long silence would lead you to believe, it would be the ending.  i was shocked that someone other than myself announced to you something that i would have rather shared in a more personal way.  i hope that it doesn't pour the proverbial salt in the wound for me to wish you the best as you head to philadelphia.  i have little doubt that through your gifts numerous corners of the developing world will be introduced to the wonderful majesty of God's Kingdom.  undoubtedly there are more things to say, but i trust that you can hear the cry of my heart.  i long to realize the reconciliation that Christ has effected between us and hope that in some small way we can experience the community that i so foolishly neglected some years ago.    peace of Christ,  gentry",

Lots of loose ends are getting tied up.  More importantly, I'm looking forward to the opening of softball season that night.  It's not just opening night -- Mark and I are going to have a long awaited cigar after the game. \nHe had a baby boy a month ago and this cigar had been planned as soon as he told me.  Two weeks ago, I also found out he was being laid off of his job as a salesperson.  We talked for about a half an hour discussing his recent travels, the new baby, softball and what the hell he was going to do next - there's a lot of stress with a new baby and no job.  I don't think Mark needed someone to tell him that things would work out, but I did.  I also told him not to forget the stogies for the game on Tuesday, 'No way dude, I'm all over that.'  Mark smokes good cigars and I knew he was bringing something tasty.  We'd sit around, smoke, drink a few beers, and talk all this shit out.  I changed my plane reservation from Tuesday night to Wednesday morning. \nTuesday is in the home stretch -- I'm following up on some urgent shit at the office that will ultimately be entirely forgotten in a matter of weeks, beginning to pack my bags and powering up the extra laptop batteries so I could watch a DVD on the plane... and I get a call from my wife.  It was one of those 'aw shit' things.  She had called earlier while I was in a meeting and I forgot to call her back.  The message was something like 'Mark from your softball team died last week...' \nI didn't hear her correctly, or she didn't get the message correctly... I called our answering machine to hear it for myself.  At 12:15 on a Tuesday afternoon his wife called to tell me her husband had died and that she knew he was scheduled to come tonight, but wouldn't be coming to the game.  'Please tell the guys for me.' \nWe were also getting ready for a different season.  On game night, we would follow-up with a poker game that could last until 2AM.  Not bad for a weeknight.  One thing I never understood was Mark's affinity for gangster rap.  A thin white kid who grew up in a predominantly white suburban setting, Mark could lip sync Public Enemy like he was from Compton.  He would put it into the CD player and we would be playing and it would shuffle in and he would break out in a rap... It was too damn funny. \nThe entire middle of me disappeared.  I was standing there with absolute emptiness where my heart and gut had been just seconds before.  I quickly left work and went home to try to find out more.  I finally got in touch with the guy who introduced us and he filled me in to the details and let me know that the funeral was at 1:00 that day.  She was to bury her husband in 45 minutes and she called to tell me that he wasn't coming to the game.  Mark was seemingly healthy - a thin athletic build and there was nothing deceptive about his speed -- he could really turn it on.  After the game that night I told everyone on the team what had happened.  What a horrible thing, what an absolutely horrible thing to have to do.  Prepared speech went out the window and a stream of words came out of my head and I didn't stop until the faces looking back at me registered the news.  Then I shut up. \nSoftball, cars, cigars, beer, rap music, poker -- He was a husband and a father, and he was my friend.  Mark will be missed.  He had mentioned that he had a little thing with his heart once, several years ago when we found out one of the guys on our team had open heart surgery.

        "blog_text": "Given our current cognitive architecture, the level of self knowledge that is achievable depends a great deal on your awareness of that architecture. The structure and source of your mind/brain, is one of the central tenets of any philosophy of self that hopes to have any success in allowing real introspection. Understanding your biological basis is the first step to transcending it in a substantial way. Yes, I did just use the word transcend, please do not misunderstand, This is not an endorsement of the emotional context that the concept of transcension finds itself in these days, it's just the only appropriate word. When your biological substrate is that of a social predator that's sole evolutionary purpose is to have complexly successful progeny, and lots of them, doing maths, and building houses,  can all be understood as transcending your design. Real Transcendence, manipulating your substrate, channeling and directing your evolutionary impulses, only comes with understanding, and effort. Unfortunately, we're not at a place where we can flip switches and get better. It takes real time to become aware of the processes of your mind, and move them closer to where you want to be.  With that in mind, I'd like to discuss daily life. Daily, or moment to moment, is the way most people really experience life. Noble thoughts, and works of poetry can have great emotional impact, but ideas only alter a person, when they begin to intrude upon their actions and a decisions in a detailed way. The Ideas of Rationality, of the Scientific Method, of Altruism, and of Transhumanity, can have great emotional impact, but in many cases, I see it having little impact on daily life. People continue doing their jobs, and driving their cars, and may make plans to do things, but rarely get up the next day and alter. It may be that rationalist thought has a weakness, which prevents it from deeply affecting the majority of humans who encounter it. I'm tempted to say this is a weakness of the human design, that our cognitive architecture is too specialized towards our context and evolutionary environment to embrace rational ways of thinking.  But it is more likely that as a memetic trigger, the concept of rationalism has been missing something in it's presentation to most people.   A major, if informal objection to the way I think and formalize and act, is that it has little passion or inspiration. I invariably disagree, and say that I feel very strongly about the things I do and think. But the point is well-taken. I come across to people as dry or unfeeling so often, that there appears to be a pattern I am unable as of yet to correct for. I am not unfeeling. But communication is one of my claimed strengths, and I am evidently failing to communicate. It has it's roots, I think, in the emotional quality of poetry vs. Scientific Journalism. It is said, usually by proponents of emotional quality, that less is more. Perhaps it is the endless qualifications and adjunct specifications that kills the 'passion' of my positions. Or perhaps it's the bad formation. Usually, when I am writing or talking, the subject has a quality of exploration. Because I range so far afield, when I do spend time on a specifics, often, it's for the first time. So my speaking or writing is always littered with new ideas, expressed well or badly, or limpingly explored. Perhaps it is this quality that seems to make my rationalism passionless. Example: Richard Feynman, perhaps one of the best scientific authors I've ever read. His deep understanding of physics paradoxically allowed him to make some concepts absurdly simple, and easy to understand. His talks and writing are both full of excitement and passion, and almost always well thought out. Perhaps as a function then, understanding always progresses towards poetry, simple, exact, and emotional.   I'm not certain, but I don't it's quite that simple. It never is, in my experience. The truth is likely halfway between, that rationalist thought has never really been presented clearly, only being represented in human beings, whose understanding of it has been flawed and oppositional. And our poor evolved brain seems likely to defend against any incursion by concepts that are unrelated to reproductive fitness. Lucky and strange that such mishmashes of adaptations and instincts could  converge upon the tenet of rational thought. That doing the right things for the right reasons is more effective and powerful than any shortcut of knee-jerk reactions.

        "blog_text": "Some days I feel like I could just write and write forever and just keep pouring out anything that popped up in my mind. I have no notions of being a writer of the official capacity but the actual act of writing I find to be very therapeutic, for me its the fastest way to simplify your thought process and clarify what is really important. I find that like most people I tend to guilt myself a lot internally, constantly harping on certain areas of my life, job, money, relationships, etc Adding to the stress I already feel from external sources. Its really very counter-productive and silly, but for some unknown reason I am unable to stop myself from nagging myself. Writing allows me to temporarily turn off some of the voices, and to re-route that energy into a different direction.    For 3 years I had an online diary that I updated religiously on the opendiary.com website. I was one of the first people to start writing on that site and for the first couple of years I absolutely loved the daily 2 hours I spent there writing and reading. However, there began to be a great deal of pressure to respond to peoples comments and to explain items I had written. I guess after being a part of peoples daily life for so long, they began to feel as though they have a say or a right to dictate to a degree what I wrote about, or when I should provide further clarification and details.   It began to become a chore to write, and ironically enough the writing became another source of stress. Entirely my own fault, as I was cocky enough to like the attention I was receiving and stupid enough to think I had to meet peoples expectations in order to keep their attention.   Around the same time I received an odd e-mail in my inbox from an individual (Stephen) who had followed my ramblings for a number of months and had actually gone back and read my entire collection. By this point I had written over 500 single spaced letter size pages (I kept a printer version in a 3 inch binder) so right away my attention was captured by such a feat of insanity.  Thus began an e-mail saga that would continue well into the next 3 years of my life, and become my first experience of a true meeting of the minds. Eventually I realized I was being a fool and took my stressful diary offline, and wrote solely to Stephen and on paper.  Long story short (yeah right, once I get started I can be incredibly verbose) this is my first attempt to seriously make a go at writing online again, while still maintaining my integrity. Ive decided to post my URL in a few places, but Im not going to make any attempt to gain readership, at least for the first little while. It would be nice to confirm I can indeed write for myself, while still being aware of the fact I may or may not have an audience.   So is there a point to this ramble not really.   I am just feeling incredibly reminiscent today and wanting to browse in words through my thoughts. Its been a long time since I last wrote/talked to Stephen, things became complicated when we started to cross the lines of penpal to phone pal and potential real life pal. We both loved books, writing, talking, discovering new areas of the world, and laughing, but we could just never quite agree on what future our relationship could have. I truly do not believe that you can fall in love without ever knowing a person in real life, and obviously Stephen felt differently about that.   Ive been asked if I miss him, of course I do. You cant share your inner thoughts and laughter with someone for so long and not miss that relationship. Whether its friendship or companionship, you always miss those that have touched your life and left lasting marks on your mind. Oddly enough, sometimes I picture him out there reading books, writing thoughts and I wonder if hes thinking of me, imagining me doing the same.   Its a strange comfort.  Life is like that. You meet people, you interact, and sometimes you have a profound impact on someones life in just 5 minutes, other times it takes years.  On the flip side, you may see someone or talk to someone everyday of your life and never give him a thought but for those moments spent in his presence.   That too is a strange comfort; knowing that not everyone occupies a permanent place in your thoughts, but at the same time knowing that there are those special few who always will.",

        "blog_text": "For generations, the mechanics of modern life have been such that we have had to adapt to an unnatural and abused way of living. With depression and stress related illnesses at an all time high, the effects of stress are taking a grave toll on our health.  On a physical level, our bodies depend on the harmony of all the complex energy patterns that go to make up the human body. This balance is most delicately poised and can be disorganized by sustained levels of stress, toxins, viruses, and negative emotions, should it be diverted from its proper behaviour disharmony or illness follows.  Whatever happens within the physical or emotional body is reflected in its electromagnetic or energy field (aura) and can be clearly seen as an imbalance when photographed using Kirlian photography. This tells us that the flow of vital life force energy is adversely affected by mental, emotional and physical stresses and unless rectified that individual can never be truly healthy.  As a Plexus Bio-Energy practitioner I became very interested in the way the body and its energy field stores stress, emotional issues and even physical trauma. I discovered that, as my hands would sweep over a patient’s energy field I would often locate the seat of an old injury even though this injury may have happened when the patient was a child and did not cause any conscious concern to the patient. What intrigued me was that this information was still stored in the cellular memory of the physical body, and more seriously that it manifested itself within the energy field as a blockage or disturbance to the natural flow of energy. I realised that until cleared, the energy field has no way of releasing or transforming these cellular memories of injuries or negative emotions.   I began to realise that the body’s system for storing information within the energy field was a vital key to the cause of many deep rooted illnesses. I became fascinated in what I call Body-Wisdom. By using a combination of intuition and Bio-Energy I found that I could locate blockages and interpret the significance or symbolism of location of the blockage, for instance the hips might represent support, left is the receiving side, right is the directional side etc), this interpretation would guide the patient directly back to the ‘cause’ of the problem.. Once we were at the energetic ‘cause’ it was astonishing to see the deep cellular memory clearing. By working with the purity and intelligence of the body-mind dynamic we were able to clear and release the blockages of some very deep issues and a profound and often fascinating ‘self-healing’ would occur.   My introduction to the existence of the body’s energy field came about some time after I was diagnosed with the debilitating autoimmune disease, Lupus. Being told I had an incurable and potentially fatal disease had the unsurprising effect of galvanising me into some sort of action! Initially it was a sheer panic type of action, and then a wiser sense started to kick in that says simply ‘slow down’. Therefore, to begin with I found I oscillated violently between these two extremes, with no particular form of control or knowledge on how to handle myself or the situation.   On good days I think I read just about every book on the subject of mind, body and spirit. Determined I set about my own research trying different relaxation techniques, visualisations and meditations. The proof of their efficacy would be if I was able to feel physically better and mentally calmer. I soon began to realise that some of these techniques helped me more than others; I was starting to feel more grounded and centred. Most importantly, when you are told you have an incurable disease, is not to let the apparent ‘hopelessness’ of the situation overtake you; it is vital to be self-empowered– this aspect alone can, I have discovered, make the difference between an illness ruling your life or not. The more I explored, studied and practiced the more I became aware and then finally convinced, that it was time to revaluate not just what was happening in my body or in my life, but I had to search for an answer in a wider context – I had to find a way to integrate mind, body and spirit.  Almost as if in an answer to a prayer I picked up an article about ‘Plexus Bio-Energy’, which described how bio-energy therapy draws on ancient Chinese techniques for balancing the mind, body, spirit dynamic and how this technique is used to rebalance and heal the body. This was my cue and I immediately booked up for treatment and then went on to train in Energy Medicine. Intuitively, I knew that this was the missing link in my search; by unblocking the body’s energy field coupled with specific meditations and visualisations, I knew I had found the vital key in reclaiming my own health on a profound level.   If we were to realise that any pain or illness we suffer is our body’s way of trying to get us to ‘come back home’, to get more in tune with ourselves, we will find that we can view these events in a different light and realise that it is in fact a wonderful opportunity to evolve. We are our own greatest friend and ally and by relearning our own Body-Wisdom we can join forces within ourselves again, to begin a journey and reclaim our own exquisite potential.    Bio-Energy can guide you back into your body, to realise the vast and powerful resources that have been waiting for you to find your way home.   For all our internal 'hard-wiring' and thousands of homeostatic mechanisms, we can change our skills, acquire new ones.. that is the ultimate glory of being a human being.  Deepak Chopra",

        "blog_text": "And so the saga continues on the 'Christian Fundamentalist' vs the universe in the soap opera that has now got one sad little man, Randall Terry, justifying his 'views' and his 'parental skills'; which is more of a 'my sons gay, my daughter is a Muslim, it must that evil and immoral liberal media I tell ya! evil!' rant than actually anything sincere. Well, to make it interesting, lets break down the article; that always brings a bit of lively entertainment ;-)  Family Values - Randall Terry Fights Gay Unions. His Son No Longer Will.   By Michael Powell, Washington Post Staff Writer, Thursday, April 22, 2004; Page C01   His father, Randall Terry, was a wavy-haired charismatic possessed of a mellifluous voice and proudly extreme politics, a Christian warrior from Upstate New York who founded Operation Rescue, appeared regularly on national television and denounced murderous abortionists and demonic homosexual sodomites.   Sounds like a nice chap to invite around for Devonshire teas with the folks to talk the awful liberal media, how ignorance is the greatest weapon against pregnancy and how 'rump riding' is destroying America [Please insert here the necessary scream followed by the hands thrown in the area with the traditional 'Praise the Lord' as the banjo playing bible thumpers are worked up by our little show man]   Randall Terry adopted Jamiel, and Jamiel became his adoring son. He rose to his father's defence during an unsuccessful congressional race. And he joined his dad in taking up the rhetorical sword to fight against homosexual civil unions in Vermont in 2000.  Theirs was a righteous narrative of father and son. Until Jamiel decided to write a new chapter.   Yes folks, we all know where this is heading. Remember the saying by Chris Rock when he was performing at the Apollo, 'Whoever you hate WILL end up in your family. If you're homophobic, you gonna have a gay son.' Oops, I've give too much away already ;-)   'It's hard to point to one moment when you begin to come out to yourself,' Jamiel begins his essay in the May issue of Out magazine, which appears on newsstands this week, 'but if I had to, I'd go back to a night seven years ago when I was 17 . . . in my old bedroom at my parents' house . . . where my friend 'Johnny' and I had just finished fooling around.'  This was the moment, Jamiel wrote, when he realized he was gay.   And this is the moment when hell, fire and brimstone was sprayed down on their house by the ever so caring and loving father [insert rolling of eyes]   Jamiel, 24, has close-cropped hair, mocha colouring and a stud under his lower lip. He's handsome and articulate, with the preternatural ease in the spotlight found in celebrity children. He lounges in a white leather chair in a friend's house in suburban Charlotte and talks of his decision to bear public witness to his sexuality.  He wrote his article, he says, to help children of Christian fundamentalists deal with their own sexuality. Maybe he also wrote to help his father understand him. Or maybe he wrote to make him understand something else.   Sounds like a noble cause, but lets remember, the ultimate cornerstone of  every  fundamentalist; be it Christian, Muslim or Jewish, is ignorance followed closely by arrogance, which keeps the ignorance in check (ever notice when you challenge a fundamentalist Christians belief, their first weapon is defence, followed by slander with screaming and yelling coming a close third) and denial.  If people are bought up in this sort of environment, the likelihood of them actually acknowledging their sexuality is very low, and this compounded by the fact that home schooling encourages this insular attitude to the world around them, the chance of them seeking help outside the family unit is even lower.  Its the equivalence of these children living in North Korea where they're taught to praise Kim Jong Il and never question decisions 'made by the peoples workers party or our great leader'.   A few years back, Randall Terry divorced his wife, Cindy -- who once said her husband was touched by the divine -- and married a much younger woman. (Terry's ex barely speaks to him anymore.) Their four children say they still love their father but the relationship has frayed. Terry recently barred one of his adopted teenage daughters from his house after she got pregnant out of wedlock for the second time. Another adopted daughter also became pregnant as a teenager and later converted to Islam, a religion Terry has described as composed of 'murderers' and 'terrorists.' (The couple's lone biological child, a daughter, is in college.)   Oh, there are the juicy bits. So Randall Terry moves from being 'faithful and loyal husband' to 'dirty old man looking for better slap 'n tickle in the bedroom'.  As for a 'religion composed by murders and terrorists', how interesting that his ilk is quite happy to promote criminal activities like  Army Of God  which approves of the actions of the now convicted murderer Paul Hill.    The night before Jamiel's interview with The Washington Post, Randall Terry drove seven hours from his Florida home to visit Jamiel in Charlotte. Theirs was not a pleasant talk. Why, Randall demanded, didn't you tell me you were thinking of writing this and committing an act of betrayal? I could have helped you with a Christian cure for homosexuality.  Jamiel hikes his eyebrows as he recalls the conversation. 'I told him: 'Dad, how was I supposed to tell you? Look at who you are.' '   Oh, goodie a 'cure' like 'walking classes' to teach one how to walk in a 'manly fashion', 'voice deepening classes' to curb that campness and let us not forget the hand holding and guitar playing classes where they all sit around talking about their feelings whilst claiming to each other they're receiving the 'holy spirit'.  Please, the success rate of these 'clinics' are so dodgy, I've got a better chance of training my cat how to woof, and even if I did achieve this feet, it would change the fact that it is still a cat. Denial is a wonderful thing, and it is one of the three cornerstones of fundamentalism (as mentioned previously).   'My Prodigal Son'  You pick up the telephone and there's Randall Terry, as folksy and pained as could be.  'I'm distressed, man,' he says. 'This is absolutely the most gut-wrenching thing I've ever gone through. Man, I'm grieving.'  You're a father, he says to the reporter. You know my pain. I tried, Randall says, to talk my son out of going public, but Jamiel paid me no heed. I tried to explain the ramifications, but Jamiel turned a deaf ear.   What ramifications? the fact that it could possibly affect his (Randall's) empire building? the fact that he could possibly have a happy son who is secure with knowing who he truly is rather than being told what he is by his father.   So Randall, 45, did what made sense to him as a father, not to mention to a man who harbours hopes of regaining a leadership role in the Christian evangelical and antiabortion movement. (The pastor of his previous church -- the Landmark Church of Binghamton, N.Y. -- unceremoniously tossed him out when he divorced his wife.) Before Jamiel's article could appear, Randall wrote his own, and titled it 'My Prodigal Son, the Homosexual.'   So in other words, this was all part of Randall's empire building game; great the model family, have the perfect wife and children; if he plays his cards rights, he gets top job in the local 'we hate women having a choice' foundation.   He posted this essay on several Web sites, including his own, RandallTerry.com. He wrote of his love for Jamiel and his son's gifts -- his keen mind, singing voice and cooking skill. But Randall cautions that one must understand this about his son: The Terrys rescued Jamiel from a very dark home. Jamiel was born in jail, a victim of 'crimes and treacheries' too terrible to spell out (if not too terrible for a father to hint at). Jamiel is a liar who's led a double life.  'My son's life,' Randall wrote, 'is a shambles.'  As open letters go from father to son, it's quite extraordinary. Did Randall wrestle with doubt before putting such an unsparing document on Web sites and later publishing a version of it in the Washington Times?  'It about tore my heart out to write that column, but Jamiel prostituted my name,' Randall says. 'The truth is that Jamiel is not trustworthy. The truth is that his life is one long deception. May God have mercy. May Christ have mercy.'   When in doubt, slander the gay. You'd think that our old friend Randall would come out with something a little more original, but hey, we live in hope.   Family Affair  Families surely are a most inscrutable product of God's hand. Who should know this better than Randall Terry?  Randall came rambling out of the capacious lands of northern New York. His grandmother was a civil rights activist, his aunts were strong feminists -- one would later serve as spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Rochester. Randall, as this aunt once noted with intentional irony, was raised at the knees of feminists.   Hmm, and using this, he should have turned out to be a genuine, tree hugging, pro-choice, gay friendly and open minded individual. I guess nurture doesn't always have the final say on matters.   Randall, though, was sweetly oblivious. He played a mean guitar and piano, and smoked bodacious amounts of herb. He was going to be a rock-and-roll star. A bright kid, he dropped out of high school a few months short of graduation, stuck out a thumb and disappeared into the West.  A few months and boatloads of dope and magic mushrooms later, he washed ashore in Galveston, Tex. He had his epiphany in a diner and that was that. Randall Terry never had much trouble divining God's will after that -- the transmissions were crystal clear.   Translation; he saw an evangelical one night on television screaming hell, fire and brimstone and thought, 'f**k, anyone could do that, and going by the expensive suite and hair styling, he must rake in the cash! oh, and check out that music set, what a show man'.   Terry returned to Rochester and began talking of God and hellfire, and selling used cars. Once he fell to his knees by the side of a highway and beseeched the Lord to forgive his sins. He enrolled in a Bible school, where he met his wife, Cindy. They talked of serving as missionaries in Central America. But 'God interrupted' and delivered unto Terry a vision of a battle plan to fight abortion.   Translation: There is a new opening in the God reselling business and it appears to be in the anti-abortion screaming section! great, these people are nuts, have money and it'll provide me with a nice little thing to do and won't require me to do any real work apart from appearing at rallies, scream the rant and go home. Not too bad for 4hours work each week.   Terry read civil rights tracts, including Coretta Scott King's memoir, and slowly hatched a plan. In 1986 he founded Operation Rescue. This would become a significant moment in the history of the Christian right, the first time an evangelical general would wield the tools of civil disobedience in the service of the antiabortion cause.   Translation: Randall needed a more formal organisation for his business venture to work, so he formed the Operation Rescue Corporation with its sole aim to suck cash from its supports, scream and rant about topics that 95% quite frankly couldn't give two hoots about and keep bringing in the sheep for more indoctrination.   In 1988, Terry and his legions started standing in front of local abortion clinics, screaming and pleading with pregnant women to turn away. They tossed their bodies against car doors to keep abortion patients from getting out. They waved crucifixes and screamed 'Mommy, Mommy' at the women. When Terry commanded, hundreds went jellyfish-limp and blockaded the 'death clinics.'  In 1989, a 'Holy Week of Rescue' shut down a family planning clinic in Los Angeles. More than 40,000 people were arrested in these demonstrations over four years. Subtlety wasn't Terry's thing -- he described Planned Parenthood's founder, Margaret Sanger, as a 'whore' and an 'adulteress' and arranged to have a dead fetus presented to Bill Clinton at the 1992 Democratic National Convention. (He also opposed birth control and divorce -- 'Families,' he wrote in his 1995 book 'The Judgment of God,' 'are destroyed as a father vents his mid life crisis by abandoning his wife for a 'younger, prettier model.' ')   The old Christian Fundamentalist Pastors excuse for everything, 'the rules don't apply to me because I receive devine revelation!'   A few years earlier came a day that looms large in the Legend of Randall Terry. Terry had stopped a troubled young woman outside an abortion clinic and persuaded her to bring her pregnancy to term. The baby, Tila, was born in 1985.  'After I saved Tila's life, we helped her mother out with baby furniture and clothes,' Terry recalls. 'We became more and more involved with her family. The children stayed with us for summers, holidays, weekends.'  In 1987, Randall and Cindy agreed to take in Tila and her older brother, Jamiel, then 8, and his older sister, Ebony, as foster children. In 1994, they formally adopted Tila and Jamiel. The children are biracial. Their biological mother, who was white, has since died.  Randall circulated a résumé at the time that described his family. 'Children: One by birth and three black foster children.'  Terry's fame arced high during this time, his days and nights a blur of airports and appearances on 'Crossfire' and 'Nightline.' ('Did you see my sound bites?' he'd inquire when reporters called for interviews in the late 1980s.)   Well, operation, 'I have a nice perfect family' is now working, now onto step two of 'theocratising the United States'.   The family lived in a Victorian home set in the rolling farmland outside Binghamton in south central New York. Randall was the outsize patriarch, his energy inexhaustible, his laughter infectious, his control considerable. He read everything, sang like an angel and played that piano. At night, he'd tuck in the children and pray with them.  'I idolized my dad. He's a very magnetic person and my best friend,' Jamiel says. 'He was running a major national organization, we'd have all sorts of guests -- Jerry Falwell came by.  'Our life was never boring.'  Randall takes pride in saying he shielded his family from the media spotlight. But the membrane between public and private life can be porous for a movement man. When Randall ran for Congress in 1998 and faced charges of racism, Jamiel stepped forward. Identifying himself as a person of colour, Jamiel demanded that his father's opponent apologize.  It's hard to know after talking with Jamiel and his sisters how much of their narrative is reality and how much desire. They insist their childhood was happy even as they say their parents' unyielding moral code allowed for few adolescent stumbles. They were to study the Bible and live its word. They were schooled at home and in fundamentalist schools. R-rated movies were out. So was divorce and any talk of sexuality.  'My parents were very strict and sheltering,' recalls Tila, a startling 18-year-old beauty who is unmarried and now pregnant for the second time. 'They were very loving but we never talked about anything.'   Interesting to note; Tila was almost exclusively bought up by Randall and look at the net result of it; a daughter, 18 years old and pregnant with her second child; it speaks volumes in terms of success, or their lack of, of their 'no sex talk' philosophy.  As I said previously, their whole existence is based around the tripod fundamentalism; Ignorance, Arrogance and Denial. Denial and Ignorance play a big factor in a fundamentalist family; they assume if they kids don't know about it, it won't happen. Using that logic, if they don't watch someone getting punched, they won't punch someone, which is crazy as like sex, there are ingrained things people already know, it is the duty of the parent to teach the child acceptable ways to control/use those ingrained things.   Ebony, now 28, left home when she was 16 and became pregnant soon after. 'When you get out of a family with very strict rules, you are exposed to so much,' she says. 'You discover how easy it is to make the wrong choice.'   Yeap, and this is the negative spin off of the tripod of fundamentalism.   When his parents divorced, Randall refused to let his children speak with their grandfather for three years. At 16, Jamiel was a summer intern with the American Center for Law and Justice, founded by the Rev. Pat Robertson. Afterward, Jamiel announced that he wanted to become a chef.  His father was not amused.  'He told me I could leave his house at that very moment,' Jamiel recalls. 'He wanted me to be a lawyer, a judge, in the movement. He told me he'd cut me off cold if I became a chef.'   Interesting how this is part of Randall's whole empire building game; 'Stuff the kids, screw the the wife, I want my empire god damn it, and I want it now!'. Sounds like another money and power hungry individual who is more concerned with control and manuplating those around him for his own 'grand plan' than actually listening and being the supposed father figure he makes himself out to be.   Awakening  At the time, Jamiel was beginning to wrestle with a far greater inner conflict -- his own sexuality. Asked if he tried to broach this subject with his parents, Jamiel returns a look that suggests you're on crack. As he noted in Out magazine: 'When you grow up in a house where to be the thing you are is an abominable sin, you tend to try and shed those behaviors.'  He practiced deepening his voice. He avoided anything hinting of the effeminate. And he dated girls even as he fooled around with male friends in his bedroom. 'It was so secret and so hidden, I don't think I even felt the weight of it,' Jamiel says.   Haven't we all tried that? Heck, I remember back when I was 14 trying to deny that I was gay; from trying to act tough, to talking with a low voice, heck, even tried to take up 'tough' sport to prove I was a 'rough 'n tough bloke' when in actual fact I was a 'pretty fairy who preferred public speaking and debates'.   Sometimes he'd sneak into his father's library late at night and look at his collection of books on gays and gay life (Terry maintained the collection so he could speak with authority on such questions).  'I looked at the pictures of shirtless men,' Jamiel wrote. 'I even picked up some useful knowledge about safe sex from these volumes.'  An air of cognitive dissonance attends to this voyage of discovery, to his navigation between nights of desire and days of self-loathing. A 20-year-old Jamiel did a stint with the short-lived Steve Forbes for President 2000 campaign. Later he repaired to Vermont to help his father campaign against gay civil unions.  It was an awkward reunion. Randall Terry recently had separated from Cindy and taken up with a young former housekeeper and aide. He was shunned by many friends and activists in the antiabortion movement. Randall moved for a while to Nashville and tried his hand at country music. (He recently cut a second album with Ronnie Milsap's band. 'It's to die for, man,' Randall says.)   About the only thing I can say here is good on those who shunned Randall after the divorce, especially after he screamed about the evils of divorce, abortion and homosexuality.   'My father kept saying, 'It's no one's business that I got divorced,' ' Jamiel recalls. 'I'd tell him: 'Dad, you sent out 100,000 Christmas cards with pictures of our perfect Christian family. You led Christian workshops on being a good husband. That's why people are disappointed.' '  Randall conceded that Jamiel had a point.   Yes, and maybe you should also recant on your comments regarding homosexuality and abortion as these both can be classified under the 'It's no one's business that I got/am [homosexual/abortion]'.   Now Randall plunged into his second act, as an anti-gay-rights crusader, heading an organization called Loyal Opposition.  'The Bible,' Randall notes, 'doesn't condemn divorce, but it does condemn homosexuality.'  He opened an office in Montpelier, within sight of Vermont's gold-domed Capitol building. One day he walked outside the capitol during a legislative vote and shook his head as though to dislodge images too horrible for words.  'It's hideous in there, man,' he told reporters. 'It's unbelievable. It's demonic.'   When in doubt, and lost all credibility, move to a new state and start a new hate crusade! Btw Randall, the bible does (according to most in your ilk) condemn divorce, according to the Catholic Church, which for 1500, before the Protestant reformation, claimed that a divorce as immoral and even then, there are still Protestants who believe that divorce is immoral.  Then again, we're talking about a person who makes the rules as he goes along. When they affect him, he'll change/tweak them to suit his agenda. He is like the populist politician who changes with the wind.   Jamiel felt a little queasy about the whole undertaking. But that didn't stop him from staying on in Vermont. Jamiel isn't particularly good at articulating, what, precisely he was thinking.  'I felt very hypocritical,' he acknowledges. 'I would get these angry phone calls from gays and I wanted to say: 'I know, I know, I'm gay, too!' '  Soon Jamiel quit and headed south. Many months later, he told his family that he was gay. His mother thought he was having a nervous breakdown. His father offered to send Jamiel away for a three-month Christian cure. Jamiel declined the offer.   And I say, good for you. The only thing you would get out of this so-called 'Christian cure' is the ability to play the guitar, a few happy-go-lucky songs and possibly some new acclamations one can scream out when at church whilst claiming you're receiving the holy spirit.   'I'm going to be at your funeral,' Randall told his son. 'You'll be dead by 40.'   Don't ya just love good old-fashioned Christian forgiveness and love ;-)   These were months of deep struggle, a time during which Jamiel thought more than once of suicide. Eventually, he came to a point of calm and thought of writing about his struggle. After a fashion, he sees himself acting on his father's teachings.  'We were taught that if you saw pain in the world, you should speak out,' he says. 'I knew that because of my name I could get published and help young men and women who are gay and struggling because of their religious upbringing.  'I was raised in a family where it's immoral to see a problem and remain silent.'   That must be about the only thing one can say that Randall taught that was actually a useful skill.   Randall's Lament  'The only reason you want to talk with me is because his last name is Terry. He's playing you and he's prostituting my name.'  So the father talks about the son whom he raised to adulthood. In a long phone conversation, Randall Terry says his son is lost, a drug user and a liar who has written bad checks. Randall says Out magazine paid Jamiel $5,000 to write the article and become its 'homosexual poster boy.' Randall says the magazine's editors 'put words in my son's mouth.'  (For the record, Jamiel and the editors of Out say much of this is wrong. Jamiel says he sought out the magazine because he felt an obligation to help those struggling with their own sexual identity. He was paid roughly $2,500. While his account was edited, Jamiel claims ownership of the words.)  In Randall's view, most -- no, make that all -- of Jamiel's problems arise from his formative years in his biological mom's home.  'Tragically,' Randall writes in his online essay, 'by the time we got him as a foster child, he had already learned a lifestyle of deceit. . . . My hope was that providing a loving safe home, his life would be spared. . . . Unfortunately, my hopes and prayers were not realized.'  Randall, by turns, is voluble and pained at what he says is a media intrusion into his privacy and that of his family. Then he puts his mother -- Jamiel's grandmother -- on the phone to talk about Jamiel's problems. Then Randall gets back on the phone and demands to know: Did Jamiel tell you what his biological mother did for a living?  The reporter replies that Jamiel and Tila describe their biological mother as more child than adult, a thoroughly lost woman of the street.  Randall exhales into the phone, disgusted. 'Dealing with Jamiel is like dealing with his biological mother -- you never know when he's playing you,' he says. 'I will tell you for sure: Jamiel's mother was a prostitute.'  'God rest her soul,' he adds.  Brick by brick, Randall dismantles the House of Terry. He says Jamiel has been bounced from three colleges and tries to suck up to wealthy family friends. Randall had to bar Tila from his house because, he says, 'to quote an AA phrase, her life just became more and more unmanageable.'  As for Ebony, she left home as a teenager and became pregnant. But their relationship is good. At least, he says, she's honest.  By the way, Terry adds, you do know that I never officially adopted her?  Since leaving the Terry home, Ebony has become a Muslim, a conversion she attributes -- for better and worse -- to her upbringing.  'We learned that, nine times out of 10, if someone is being persecuted for their religion, there's probably some truth to the religion,' Ebony says. 'And the Christian community is supposed to stand for forgiveness and charity, but my experience hasn't been entirely positive.'  The irony is that Jamiel's essay is quite a tender piece. He describes a loving childhood, writes of his love for his father, and concludes with a vision of future reconciliation. Even Randall, who will be in Washington this Sunday protesting a massive abortion rights rally, acknowledges the essay could have been worse.  'Overall, the article isn't unfair to me,' he says. 'But that isn't the issue. He prostituted my name.'  Hours later, Jamiel is told of his father's counterattack. He sighs. Jamiel acknowledges he's had a troubled time these past few years, with a drunken-driving conviction and some bad checks.  'Dad doesn't mess around with Tomahawks, he sends in the nuclear warheads,' Jamiel says. 'My father's first and foremost aim is to protect himself. He talks about how I prostitute the family's name, but he's used the fact that he saved my sister from abortion and rescued me from hardship in his speeches and interviews. What's the difference?'  Jamiel pauses and adds: 'My father talks about how deceitful I am. But I was 11, 12, 13, 14. How was I supposed to make sense, in a family that didn't talk about it, of what I was feeling? How am I deceitful?'  'I still fight the thought that I'm committing a mortal sin.' There's a moment of silence and Jamiel continues. 'God knows my heart. Randall Terry doesn't know my heart.'   So in a nutshell the children saw Randall for what he truely is, a power hungry man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. He'll bend the rules, change the rules, start up new groups to get his own way.",

        "blog_text": "Yesterday was a bad day. Just couldn’t seem to catch my breath, felt like just breaking down, curling into a ball, crying my eyes out and putting my fist through something… Instead I simply held my head up high and continued trying to breath in and out like a ‘normal’ person. I am just so stressed out. I am flat broke, I’m terrible at my job, my friends are mostly crap and there are very few people I can talk to because it is hard enough to think I am a failure let alone admit it to others and have them think that too. So, whenever anyone asks how the new job is going I just tell them a kind of truth…I love my job, the people are fantastic, the job itself is challenging and the hours are long, what I don’t tell them is that I am dead broke, as much as I love my job, I’m crap at it, the people are fantastic but that doesn’t really help my finances, the hours are long but no they are bloody not worth it! Not when I am earning the equivalent of $11 an hour before tax, $8 an hour after! I was earning that kind of money before I turned 18, I am now 25, earning the same bloody amount, I feel like such an utter failure! \n\nThe highlight of my week has been getting my motorcycle licence. One week ago, I was absolutely terrified of bikes, I have been bought up to be. I decided that I wanted to get over my fear and truth be told I just wanted to be able to go trail riding with the boys when we go camping rather than get stuck babysitting the little princesses they have as girlfriends, you know the type, they turn up to a campsite with luggage in tow, and I mean LUGGAGE, high heels, make up case, battery operated hairdryer, perfume, and a complete skincare routine, they then proceed to do nothing but complain that they are going to be sleeping in tents. Comments like “What!? Are you kidding me, I have to sleep in THAT? This is NOT what I am used to… I was not bought up like this…I should be in a motel or at the VERY LEAST in a nice campervan, but THIS you have got to be kidding!!!!” I want to say, yes love, actually we are kidding, see these nice dry tents, they are for us, the normal people, you on the other hand are a whining complaining little trollop who can sleep under that spider and ant ridden tree over there!!!! But I don’t I just smile politely and wish like hell that I were not afraid of bikes and could go with the boys and leave the princess’ to whinge and whine together. So I decided that I would finally do something about it and went and got a motorcycle lesson, well I loved it so much that I then booked in for my day session which concludes with testing for your learners. I can’t believe it, of all people, me, I GOT IT! I am allowed to ride a motorcycle legally!!!! Oh My God! It is simply unbelievable. The down side is that I did have to hock a school desk on ebay so that I could afford to do the lesson, but hey, at least I was kind off thinking outside the square.\n\nThis brings me to my next point, “Save Karyn” has practically saved my life, I am beginning to gain a whole new perspective on my debt, I guess the main difference between us is that my debt is higher and my wage is lower, but never the less, I have started listing things on ebay, and I am actually getting money for my stuff! Whoda thought?\n\nThere is this really terrible ebayer at the moment, I bought 5 digital cameras and had already agreed to sell them to a friend of mine, I sent payment and the bank sent it back (thank goodness) because the bank account was incorrect, well then this hideous woman, even after me emailing her to explain left me negative feedback, I felt bad about leaving her negative feedback, coz maybe she was just having a bad day or something, so I ticked the positive box and left an explanation of what happened as she didn’t seem interested in responding to any of my emails, well now I am receiving all these emails from other ebayers saying they have been ripped off by her, they have sent money and not received goods etc etc. They want to know why I ticked the positive feedback box, and now I feel terrible, in trying to do the right thing, I have once again stuffed up and because of me, she has gotten away with ripping other people off. I feel terrible.\n\nTo top off my debt concerns, I still haven’t managed to quit smoking and because I am practically living off of credit at the moment, I am not just spending a crap load of money on something that is really really bad for me, I am also paying interest on the crap load of money I am spending on something that is very very bad for me, yes, it is official, I am a stupid git!!!! What other explanation is there, I am an IDIOT!!!!! HMMMM let me see, what else, ah of course, my compulsion to eat everything in sight! Yup, as successful as I was at Weight Watchers, I am now a failure at that too! I am over goal weight and just can’t seem to stop eating crap, I crave it, I think it is triggered by stress. Crap, gotta go, Boss just asked what I was doing and then talked to me about staying motivated! Uh Ha! Yup, coz that’s easy to do, stay motivated to work your ass off for peanuts. Hey! Anyway, I AM motivated, I’m motivated to write to my imaginary cult internet followers.",

        "blog_text": "Diego A. Odchimar, III \n\nABSTRACT: A human being is a person, not merely a thing, because he is conscious that he is the origin of the will. That is, that he is an end in himself because he can set an end for itself. Thus, to be human is to be free from becoming a mere thing, or a means to an end. But there are wrong uses of freedom, like when a human being treats other human beings, including oneself, in some cases, merely as means to an end. I propose that being human presupposes a sense of community, or common humanity. \n\nKEY WORDS: end in himself, being for others, positive freedom, negative freedom, common good, common humanity, war, social contract, community, Aristotle, Hobbes, Rousseau, Mill, Kant, Sartre, Arendt \n\nEXISTENTIALISM maintains that in man, and in man alone, existence preceded essence. Jean Paul Sartre, author of Being and Nothingness, explains that man first is, and only subsequently is this or that. In a word, man must create his own essence. It is in throwing himself into the world, suffering there, struggling there, that he gradually defines himself. Man’s definition always remains open ended like an unfinished project until his own death. We cannot say what this man is before he dies, or what mankind is before it has disappeared. Man, as a rational being, was forced to define who he was through living, while a thing is what it is until destroyed. Sartre argues that with our ability to think, grow, and change, mankind is in the unique position of defining itself. We are each in charge of defining our own lives. \n\nWAR \nFreedom implies conflict. This is so because every human being has the capacity to decide for himself. In a given situation, his capacity to decide what is good, desirable or reasonable comes into fundamental conflict with another person’s identical capacity. \n\nThomas Hobbes, the author of Leviathan, argues that “if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies; and in the way to their end, which is principally their own conservation, and sometimes their delectation only, endeavor to destroy, or subdue one another.” Thus, for Hobbes, man is in a condition of war with all men because by nature he has the freedom to use his own power, as he will himself, for the preservation of his own nature. Consequently, Hobbes believe that it is the law of nature that “every man, ought to endeavor peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use, all helps, and advantages of war. The first branch of which rule contains the first, and fundamental law of nature; which is, to seek peace, and follow it. The second, the sum of the right of nature; which is, by all means we can, to defend ourselves.” Hobbes argues that if man has right to everything because he is free, then no action can be unjust. This is the reason why Hobbes called the state of nature as the state of war. The right of men to all things in nature puts men in the condition of war. \n\nIf man does not give up his right to everything in nature and enter a contract with other men to form a community, then every man is enemy to every man. In such a condition, man live without security. There is no place for industry, culture, no arts, no letters, no society. Consequent to a time of war, man is in “continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” \n\nPOSITIVE FREEDOM \nThere is a common tendency among human beings to define freedom as a capacity to attain a private good. In other words, according to Sir Robert Filmer, “a liberty for everyone to do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws.” This is positive freedom. \n\nThis might not be a problem until someone does something that we think is wrong. Worse, that person might think that what he is doing is not wrong and he does not care about other people. Thomas Nagel, author of What Does It All Mean?, illustrates the problem, “if someone just does not care about other people, what reason does he have to refrain from doing any of the things usually thought to be wrong, if he can get away with it: what reason does he have not to kill, steal, lie, or hurt others? If he can get what he wants by doing such things, why shouldn’t he? And if there’s no reason why he shouldn’t, in what sense is it wrong?” This puts man in a war of all against all. Hobbes proposes that men could escape from this bleak human condition by agreeing to transfer their positive freedom to a single sovereign power of Leviathan (absolute authority). Obviously, Hobbes’ argument is a justification of the existence of authoritarian regimes and the legitimacy of their control over the positive freedom of its subjects. The trade-off in losing one’s positive freedom by conferring it to the Leviathan is peace at home, and mutual aid against their enemies abroad. The Leviathan “defends them from the invasion of foreigners, and the injuries of one another, and thereby to secure them from in such sort, as that by their own industry, and by the fruits of the earth, they may nourish themselves and live contentedly.” This appears to be an important and compelling argument. But the absolute power of the Leviathan could ensue absolute corruption. Giving up positive freedom to an absolute authority could leave them worse off than they would have been in the state of nature. \n\nNEGATIVE FREEDOM \nThe negative sense of freedom is non-interference. It is the freedom from being determined by others, not to be under their will. That the freedom of men may be restrained from invading other’s capacity to set ends for themselves. \n\nThis sense of freedom is viewed from a more general point of view, which every thinking person can understand. Every person has a reason to consider not merely his own private good, but the good of others as well in deciding what to do. This view of freedom is public. It allows time to appeal to a common judge, or the decision of the law, for remedy in cases when a person’s conception of the good, desirable or reasonable comes into fundamental conflict with another person’s identical capacity. \n\nThus, negative freedom is what John Locke, author of Two Treatises of Government, defines as a liberty common to everyone in a given community and made by the legislative power erected in it. That is, “a liberty to follow my own will in all things, where the rule prescribes not; and not to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man.” \n\nJean Jacques Rousseau, author of The Social Contract, proposes that to solve the problem of adjudicating conflicts and arbitrary relations brought about by man’s natural right to freedom of action, it is necessary that human beings transform themselves from a group of isolated individuals with many different wills into a community with common will or interest. \n\nUnlike Hobbes, for Rousseau, there was to be no trade-off. He believes that human beings could have both liberty and law if they were able to construct a community where they ruled themselves. \n\nCOMMON GOOD \nAristotle, author of The Politics, argues that man is a political animal. Human beings do not fully realize their ends until they have become members of a community. Men, by nature, can indeed do as they want. They can pursue their private good. But what they want is necessarily very different from what it would be were they are members of a community. They have to recognize the public good that incorporates the private goods of other members. \n\nThus, the interests of members of a community will be quite different from those of men who are not part of a community. No doubt, private and public good will diverge at some points. But the over-riding good of a member of a community will be for the community to be maintained. Aristotle argues that without the community, man will not have the freedom to pursue the good life. Therefore, in order for man to achieve his private good, man must belong in a community and recognize the public good. In Aristotle’s ideal community, the public good is the common good to pursue the good life. \n\nOf course, whether he likes it or not, man is already born in a community. Unfortunately, not all communities have the same conception of the common good. Often, some human beings use their community as a means to pursue their private good and manipulate the laws so they could do as they list and live as they please. Thus, even in a community, man is in a condition of war. Still, in several communities, man does not have the liberty to follow his own will, and he is subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of other men because the prevailing laws prescribe that he be subservient to them. This is domination and oppression. It is rampant in communities where the common good is defined by the will of some of its members who want to reclaim their positive freedom to pursue their own private good. Consequently, most members of these communities are marginalized (e.g., women, children, poor, old, homosexuals, etc.). They do not have the freedom to participate in most decision-making procedures, organize groups and live the life that they value. \n\nCOMMON HUMANITY \nRousseau’s problem is “how to find a form of association which will defend the person and the goods of each member with the collective force of all and under which each individual, while uniting himself with the others, obeys no one but himself and remains as free as before.” Rousseau’s ideal community is a communion of man with the rest of humanity. That is, a community, not as a means for the pursuit of the good life as a common good, but a community, as common humanity where man can be human. \n\n“Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.” These are Rousseau‘s famous words aimed at critiquing the traditional conceptions of community. He argues that a community should ensure freedom rather than destroy it. \n\nHe proposes that, whereas individual men are physically unequal in there nature, each of them becomes equal to all others when they enter into a community under the law. \n\nInequality is natural. In the state of nature, it is might that defines right. Right to anything is ensured merely by personal strength. Since men, by nature, are not physically equal, they are not really free because they do not have security over the things that they possess. As it were, Hobbes’ Leviathan does not solve this problem because the laws that emanate from an absolute authority, most often than not, only legitimizes the private good of some men. Such a community is problematic because its sovereign power is merely the apparatus of some men to dominate and oppress others. \n\nInfluenced by Rousseau, Immanuel Kant argues that there should be equality before the law. Law should not be the will of any person, but should be something that everyone can assent to. The law should be universal in this sense. This could be possible if, and only if, we construct our laws from a more general point of view. \n\nETERNAL PEACE \nImmanuel Kant’s dream is to achieve a just political order of eternal peace. This political ideal is cosmopolitan in that it requires extending the ideals of politics to the international. That is, that the best possibility for this ideal is a peaceful confederation of republics. \n\nKant proposes that laws should be universal principles that allow the greatest possible human freedom. Laws should ensure that the freedom of each could co-exist with the freedom of all others. Thus, all laws must be ones that members of a community, understood as common humanity, would agree to, and all laws must be made public. \n\nIn practical terms, laws are universal principles only if, and only if, it commands us to treat every human being, including ourselves, in every case, as ends in ourselves, who can set ends for ourselves. This is the basis of the Kantian duty. \n\nLaws are coercive. But this does not contradict freedom for as long as laws are hindrances to hindrances of freedom. It follows that laws could be justified only in terms of how they protect the freedom of all human beings. Laws that are against humanity are hindrances to the attainment of eternal peace. For example, the anti-Semitic laws that Hitler and his Nazi regime imposed on its occupied territories during World War II. In order to attain eternal peace, man should not be merely following orders made by others for them to follow. Hannah Arendt, author of Eichmann in Jerusalem, proposes that, man should always exercise his capacity of thinking, of having internal dialogue with himself, which will permit self-awareness of the nature of one’s deeds from the experiential standpoint of his victims. \n\nCONCLUSION \nPositive freedom to do as what one lists, to live as one pleases, should be understood within the context of the negative freedom of others not to be interfered with. \n\nAs one is free to pursue one’s own private good, others have the identical freedom from being hindered from living the life that they value. What really separates man from other animals is his capacity for humanity. That is, the capacity to treat every human being, including oneself, in every case, as an end in himself and never merely as a means to an end. While man, as a rational animal, is an end in himself because he has the capacity to set and end for himself, man is a political animal as well. He is not merely a being for itself, he is also a being for others. \n\nMan can co-exist with other men in a condition of peace. He has the capacity to view his own conception of the good from a more general point of view, which every thinking person can understand, to consider not merely his own private good, but the good of others as well in deciding what to do. This way, he can live in a community with other men, not merely to pursue the good life as a common good, but to be human in a community understood as common humanity. \n\nIt is unthinking that causes man to degenerate into a beast. If only every man has a habit of thinking from a more general point of view, we can transcend the condition of war and achieve the dream of eternal peace. If this can be done, even in darkest times, human freedom is possible. \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nIn writing this essay, I benefited from the intellectual discussions I had with my students at the College of Saint Benilde, De La Salle University, Taft, Manila.

Sure we are on a pitcher team for the free keg, but there's so much more to it.  It's not the beer or the pub that keeps us coming back, its our friends.  We all gather around a table, small or big, and we talk, and talk and talk.  Time flys by and by the end of the night you not only feel better because of the beer, but because of what was talked about.  We talk about anything and everything from politics to religion to our gripes about work.    That was the conversation last night, as a matter of fact.  It was a great night last night, its one of those times where you get wrapped up in what your talking about that the concept of time is completely gone.  It is just a great group of people to be around.  I wouldn't trade them for the world.    I am one of those people that likes to keep my real feelings inside, but the minute I disagree with something that you feel or say you better believe that I am going to tell you!  But this group of friends they help me, they inspire me, and they encourage me.  I open up to them like I haven't done to anyone in a while.    There is one friend in particular that I want to mention.  Gwen, she hasn't been a part of my life for long but the time that she has been there she has opened me more than anyone I have ever known.  Her knowledge, wisdom, and kindness is amazing.  Every word she says comes from her heart, she tells you the gods honest truth and that's what I like about her.  There isn't any dancing around the truth, which I know I have been guilty of.  But she has in a way become my mentor/best friend/motivator.  She has had a huge impact on my life probably huger than she will ever know.  But I want to take this time to thank her for being there as a friend.  So anyways, the whole point of this blog is to show that its okay to let your guard down for a little while.  Let people in that you trust.  And once someone lets their guard down just once, step in carefully and tread lightly.  Because you want to come back.    Oh and Anna, my dear beloved kindest sister, I love you!  Thank you for helping me through some tough days at work and also in life.  Thank you for opening your heart and mind for me, it means a lot.    Love you all!",

Props to your EC stance, but MARRIAGE is as important to gays as it is to straights at least according to this article.  Check it out.  Why The M Word Matters To Me  Only marriage can bring a gay person home  By ANDREW SULLIVAN  Feb. 16, 2004  As a child, I had no idea what homosexuality was. I grew up in a traditional home — Catholic, conservative, middle class. Life was relatively simple: education, work, family. I was raised to aim high in life, even though my parents hadn't gone to college. But one thing was instilled in me. What mattered was not how far you went in life, how much money you earned, how big a name you made for yourself. What really mattered was family and the love you had for one another. The most important day of your life was not graduation from college or your first day at work or a raise or even your first house. The most important day of your life was when you got married. It was on that day that all your friends and all your family got together to celebrate the most important thing in life: your happiness — your ability to make a new home, to form a new but connected family, to find love that put everything else into perspective.   But as I grew older, I found that this was somehow not available to me. I didn't feel the things for girls that my peers did. All the emotions and social rituals and bonding of teenage heterosexual life eluded me. I didn't know why. No one explained it. My emotional bonds to other boys were one-sided; each time I felt myself falling in love, they sensed it, pushed it away. I didn't and couldn't blame them. I got along fine with my buds in a nonemotional context, but something was awry, something not right. I came to know almost instinctively that I would never be a part of my family the way my siblings might one day be. The love I had inside me was unmentionable, anathema. I remember writing in my teenage journal one day, 'I'm a professional human being. But what do I do in my private life?'   I never discussed my real life. I couldn't date girls and so immersed myself in schoolwork, the debate team, school plays, anything to give me an excuse not to confront reality. When I looked toward the years ahead, I couldn't see a future. There was just a void. Was I going to be alone my whole life? Would I ever have a most important day in my life? It seemed impossible, a negation, an undoing. To be a full part of my family, I had to somehow not be me. So, like many other gay teens, I withdrew, became neurotic, depressed, at times close to suicidal. I shut myself in my room with my books night after night while my peers developed the skills needed to form real relationships and loves. In wounded pride, I even voiced a rejection of family and marriage. It was the only way I could explain my isolation.  It took years for me to realize that I was gay, years more to tell others and more time yet to form any kind of stable emotional bond with another man. Because my sexuality had emerged in solitude — and without any link to the idea of an actual relationship — it was hard later to reconnect sex to love and self-esteem. It still is. But I persevered, each relationship slowly growing longer than the last, learning in my 20s and 30s what my straight friends had found out in their teens. But even then my parents and friends never asked the question they would have asked automatically if I were straight: So, when are you going to get married? When will we be able to celebrate it and affirm it and support it? In fact, no one — no one — has yet asked me that question.  When people talk about gay marriage, they miss the point. This isn't about gay marriage. It's about marriage. It's about family. It's about love. It isn't about religion. It's about civil marriage licenses. Churches can and should have the right to say no to marriage for gays in their congregations, just as Catholics say no to divorce, but divorce is still a civil option. These family values are not options for a happy and stable life. They are necessities. Putting gay relationships in some other category — civil unions, domestic partnerships, whatever — may alleviate real human needs, but by their very euphemism, by their very separateness, they actually build a wall between gay people and their families. They put back the barrier many of us have spent a lifetime trying to erase.   It's too late for me to undo my past. But I want above everything else to remember a young kid out there who may even be reading this now. I want to let him know that he doesn't have to choose between himself and his family anymore. I want him to know that his love has dignity, that he does indeed have a future as a full and equal part of the human race. Only marriage will do that. Only marriage can bring him home.

He's just emailed me with his report, which I reproduce here in full. I am now freshly scrubbed and washed but still feel a bit grimy. No ..... perhaps 'depressed would be a better word.  I left home at about three o'clock on Friday in 'suitable' clothes and started to walk up towards the West End. I took the opportunity to acclimatise myself to what was coming and started to approach total strangers and ask if they had any spare change. Now I am not trying to stereotype anyone here but I was given more by working class youngsters than anyone else. I got into a bit of a row in Canning Town with a street type who accused me of poaching on his pitch and he gave me a clump and shoved me along. I reached the embankment at about eight thirty and sat down on a bench for a much needed rest. The view across the river was nice and peaceful and I suppose that I must have dozed off for a bit because some young copper was poking me in the ribs and saying 'On your way, grandad' ... fucking cheek! I wandered up along the Strand and into Aldwych before I went into a McDonalds to spend what I had begged on a burger and a coffee. As they were serving me one of these tossers behind the counter had the nerve to say that it would DEFINITELY be a takeaway. They even asked to see my money before they asked what I wanted.  I found a small bench in Kingsway and sat down to eat and I was soon joined by a young lad in his twenties who asked if I was in a sharing mood. We were eating and talking to each other. I explained that I was a bit new to it all and that it was my first night. I had some elaborate story prepared but he just accepted me at face value and asked what sort of a day I had experienced and how much I had earned. His name was 'Jay' and he has been living rough since he was thirteen (he was about nineteen or twenty now .... he couldn't remember). We sat there asking passers by but were mostly ignored so we went back towards the Strand as the theatres were kicking out. This time we were more fortunate and amassed about fifteen quid. I think that what upset me the most was that people would simply do what I normally did and were totally oblivious to us. As far as they were concerned we simply did not exist. Seeing it all now from a different perspective I realise how wrong my attitude was. We went to the back of the Strand Palace Hotel and earned a coffee and a couple of sandwiches by clearing up the rubbish and they agreed to turn a blind eye if we wanted to sleep by the rubbish bins as long as we were gone early. We settled down out of the rain and carried on talking. As if it weren't bad enough to have to live like this these kids have to put up with nocturnal gangs who like to beat them up and take their earnings along with anything else that they fancied. I was told to avoid 'city types' when the pubs were kicking out as they liked nothing more than to beat up on beggars and to even try and set them on fire if the mood took them. It seems that the girls had it worse as they were often assaulted as a matter of course without any retribution.  We agreed to sleep in shifts so one of us could keep our eyes open for any trouble. At about two in the morning we were joined by a young girl of about eighteen who was in a bit of a state. She had been with her mate who had been dragged into a car by some Asian guys. When I asked why she hadn't gone to the police they looked at me as if I had come from another planet. It seems that the police simply aren't interested in street going's on unless they are having a 'clean up the street' initiative. She was waiting for the drop-in centre to open on Saturday morning so that she could tell someone there. Here I was sitting with the two of them who were younger than my own kids and listening to them explain the facts of life to me. A life that I have to say that I found totally incredulous and so very alien to everything that I believed about how human beings treated one another. I felt myself starting to cry for them and their wasted lives. They felt that no one on earth cared about them and the most surprising thing was that they were probably right about it all. NEVER have I missed my own family so much.  The security guard came out at about half past five and asked us to piss off because the guests were starting to wake up. We walked down to the drop in centre just off Tottenham Court Road and waited for it to open so that the girl could go in there (I never even found out her name). It opened at about seven and we went in for a hot drink whilst she said what had happened to her friend. I spoke to the guy who was working there and explained that this was all a bit new to me and in the next hour I found out about things that are far too outrageous to repeat here or anywhere else for that matter.  Saturday was a repeat of the previous evening. Jay liked to stay around the Strand-Aldwych-Charing Cross area as he felt safer there and knew all of the best places to catch tourists and hide from those who would do him harm for a spot of fun. He also knew which coffee shops would part with a drink and a sandwich for some work.  I came home this morning after walking back through the night. I had left Jay sleeping at the back of the Strand Palace. How can these kids cope with the sheer unadulterated misery of it all? Their lives and potential were simply being totally wasted for the want of a decent system of coping with them. There are some volunteers who do a spanking job here but - why should it be left up to volunteers? After bathing and shaving I shoved some clothes and a decent flask into the car and went back up to find Jay but I just couldn't see him anywhere. I gave it all to someone else who looked like he needed it. I tried to give it to a young girl who just backed away from me as though I was an alien.  Now, I have been a bit economic with my descriptions of it all as I just don't have a vocabulary that is adequate enough to do it all justice. Instead I would simply ask two things of all of you ........ Firstly, please don't just pass a beggar by.  Secondly, no matter what happens within your own families, do whatever you can to make sure that your own kids NEVER end up like this. I have had the kids round to lunch today and I just wept when they came in and I held onto them for the longest time. I wouldn't let go of Elizabeth Louise for about a couple of hours. In the end I think that I was scaring them so I told them about my weekend and what I had seen and heard. I was amazed to hear that my daughter does voluntary work for a homeless shelter in Maidstone as she had never mentioned it before.  Our young people are the legacy that we leave for the future so let's all do what we can to make sure that there futures are as happy and as safe as we can make them.  Normally I try to end these ramblings on a happy note or some smart quip - I just can't find it in me to do that at the moment.  John I can add nothing to this.",

        "blog_text": "There's one very appropiate word to describe my entire day: Exhaustion, and lots of it. The day started with me attempting to crawl out of bed... The night (or morning) before I slept at 2 am. While that's not exactly very late, I've been sleeping late the previous few nights too... Thus I was like totally woozed out. After a while I gave up and simply fell asleep leaning against the cupboard till my mom's repeated screams finally jerked me out from my slumber. Later on the mrt I overslept again. I managed to wake up at dover again... At least it's only one stop.  Through out the entire day I was rushing to annotate countless group articles... We only need 2 group annotated articles for this check but considering karno... *shrugs* During physics prac the teacher called me aside and talked to me for a while... Kept tellin me I was underachieving, that she could see I knew the answers but lacked the practice to present them in the proper way and thus lost marks. Said it was a waste of talent and that I should work hard, cause I was capable of so much more. That sounds exactly like what the econs teacher said to me a while ago... Sighz. Everyone, even my parents, seem to think I'm very smart or something... Must be some GEP thing. Though I agree wif them that I should work harder... Though the mind is willing, the body is weak :( Following physics prac was a double chinese period, half of which was used for chinese test. As usual I didn't bother to study and thus left the fill in the blank parts completely blank... Da poor chinese teacher looked very disappointed... She's supposed to be the most inspiring teacher in the entire school, used to teaching classes like mine... But somehow I have a feelin she's met her match. She's like on the verge of breakin down in class when trying to teach. I feel sympathy for her sometimes and do try to do her homework, but well. Its chinese. 'nuff said.  Later during lunch I was talkin to some of my acsi friends. When I mentioned the name 'Bryan Chua', one of them choked on his fishball, the other went 'F.CK!' Yeaps. That pretty much sums out how the acsi pple think of him... One of my friends said that his face resembles a punching bag. Honestly, I can't help but agree. Sometimes I feel guilty about how we're treating him yet Bryan... seems to ask for it. Gah.  After lunch was the worst part in my entire timetable. 4 tutorial periods, in a row, in the same class. This time it was worse coz the gpf submission deadline was 1630 hrs that day, when school ended. Thus many groups were blatantly doing their annotations in front of the teacher, mine included. Also we were rushing to do our econs homework, coz Rahimah is extremely particular about homework. She expects us to prepare the completely written essays before she goes thru in class. We can't even use points - we have to write out the essay in full. For those who dun take econs, one essay question should take about 2 to 3 sides of a normal fullscap paper. Go figure. Rahimah works hard, but she works her students hard too. Gah. Anyway during GP, just before econs, I kinda freaked out. Like I just suddenly felt at a loss of what to do... Kinda scary, for someone like me. Coz I'm gp rep, and I was rushing to finish annotating the articles and to complete the econs essay to be discussed for the next period and another piece of already late econs homework. Then suddenly Beatrice (my GP teacher) just dumps this whole pile of stuff on my table and asks me to distribute to the class. That done, I then had to like sort the extras coz like one third of my class ponned. After that she realized that she forgot to photocopy this thing. So I had to run down and do it. By that time there was 10 more minutes of GP left, and my econs homework was hardly finished. At that moment I just... Stoned? A friend said later that I was moaning or smthing. In any case it just felt terrible. In the end I did get the GP stuff done and managed to make it in time to econs tutorial. We changed the venue today. For those fortunate not to get taught by Rahimah, anybody later than 5 min for tutorials is punished, the extent of which is determined by her mood. So my class pretty much ran up the staircase to the class. And guess what? Rahimah was on course! *boggle* All my insane rants for nothing :P Gah but more exhaustion was to come. After econs was chem, after which I had physics remedial for 2 hours! Insane man... Worse thing was I had to absent myself from quite abit of cf. Suxors. Heh by the time I dragged myself into lt 2 I was like a ghost of my old self, like a machine on autopilot.   Ah yes. For those who would like to come to the Christian Fellowship's (CF) meetings they are every friday, 5pm, at lt2. Our meetings consists mainly of worship, followed by a bit of sharing depending on the programme. Following which, there will be a message by normally Pastor Barnabas. After that we split into our nuture groups, which resemble cell groups. In our nuture groups we discuss the message and we pray. That done, we go down into the void deck to tuck in to Ms Rosalind Tan's delicious food. And to fellowship of course :P For the uninformed, fellowship means... Like meeting and interacting with other christians, so yeah this is one of the more significant times of our meetings. During this time we just talk, hang around, pray sometimes, and engage in 'fellowship'. From this time onwards u can leave anytime you want, but some of us normally go to Holland V later for supper. So yeaps. That pretty much sums it up.   Mmm back to the day of exhaustion. I'm now at home, blogging and polishing for full U parade tml. My schedule tml is gonna be packed... It starts wif stupid GP common test in the morning, then chemistry remedial, then full U parade, then cell group. Furthermore my cell's in charge of the movie magiXS tml. Bleargh.

        "blog_text": "I remember dreaming about sitting in a swing as a very young girl. It was the fall and my father was pushing me back and forth, back and forth. I remember being happy to be with him. Now, as I sit here at age 26, I feel that I will never have another happy dream about my father. I will no longer have happy memories of him. There aren't too many to remember anyway. There was a day when I was 4 years old, sitting on the couch and crying as I watched my father take his suitcase and walk out the door of our home. When I was young, I wanted nothing more than his approval and his love and I suppose things haven't changed much in that way. I would still like his approval and love. I'm not going to get it. This week we exchanged e-mails. They were nasty and hateful. I haven't seen him for years...hadn't spoken to him in over 3 years. He's lived in Arizona since I was seven years old and I have never seen him much. I sent an e-mail out to everyone on my list and ended up sending it to him. There was a question asking who would be least likely to respond and I put he and my stepmother. A few days later, I recieved a response criticizing me for that comment. I was speaking nothing but the truth and thought it would be glossed over. Apparently emotions are raw in that household and I struck a nerve. Over the course of two days, he called me names, told me I was just like my mother ( the biggest insult he can weild) and told me I shirked my responsibilities. He said I was still angry with him about not giving me money at a time when I needed it. If I hadn't been desperate, I never would have asked. He said that he needed to help my step-sister with the purchase of a house and I said as much and said I understood. He wrote back stating that she had never needed their help and took nothing from them, so I should leave her the hell out of it. Caught in a lie apparently. I left my boyfriend and left him with custody of our son because I couldn't have handled being a single parent. My son would not have been in a good environment. My ex and I both new that and instead of going through the courts for a nasty battle, I conceded and left my son with him. My father did the same when he left my mother and apparently holds anger and guilt over that situation. He acts as though it was an easy decision for me. Acts as though I just left and went galavanting off on a childless vacation. In reality, I left and started to rebuild my life and myself. Now my son's father and I are closer than ever and we all have a wonderful relationship. Given the circumstances, that's the best thing that could have come out of everything. Anyhow, nasty things said by both sides. I decided to have no further contact with him last week. Ever. Maybe when I'm older that will change. But for now, he and I are both too stubborn to apologize. He hasn't been a father to me for years and I can't say that anything much has changed. Only the reality that he's the man I had always heard about and had always hoped everyone was wrong about. I still can't believe he acted in the way he did. He attacked my aunt as well. My closest friend and ally in the family. Apparently he thinks I've been poisoned against him. The two of them have had a fairly long standing feud. He said to me that family is the most important thing to him. When his parents are pissed at him, his sisters will no longer speak to him and he attacks his only biological child. I've never seen a father act in this way toward a child. Now, all of this is my perception. A one-sided arguement, I guess. I will not post e-mails here because they are simply too much to handle at this point. I want to sweep it all under the rug and forget about it. I haven't needed him for years and will continue to get along without him. It's the finality of the decision. I had always hoped he and I could be close. Apparently that's not going to be the case. Could I have done something different? Probably. But I'm not the parent here. I'm his daughter. I shouldn't have to clamor for the approval of an apparition. If he had wanted a relationship with me for the last few years, if he could have seen past whatever anger he held toward me, if things could have been worked out enough in his head to have a conversation with me....then maybe the situation would have been different. I have an ex stepfather whom I have called 'dad' since I was fairly young. He's the one who was there and continues to be. I have a stepfather now who would take care of me if push came to shove. I have a great family with lots of loving support. It took me until last week to realize what a support network I have. Randy (the bio father) seems to be the only one who doesn't want to be a part of it. He wants to get to know his grandson, that's evident. But he will not get to know my son until he gets to know me. I've already checked out the legal issues governing grandparental rights and have found out that he doesn't have any rights. He hasn't seen Erik, hasn't contacted him and it's not like he's been seeing him since he was an infant. So, that's that. If they want to take it to court, then so be it. I wouldn't put it past them. Anyhow, that has been the main part of my week. Happy Fourth of July to me.",

        "blog_text": "MEMORIES OF A FREE IRAQ. The Fire Last Time by Zainab Al-Suwaij  The New Republic Post date 02.03.03  Issue date 02.10.03  As war with Iraq draws closer, commentators, journalists, and policymakers frequently question whether the Iraqi people would really support the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. But that question has already been answered. Although Americans remember the Gulf war, many do not realize that, for a few momentous days immediately after it, much of Iraq rose up in open rebellion against Saddam's regime. In fact, 15 out of 18 Iraqi provinces rebelled. I was one of the rebels. \nFor over a decade, I have stayed silent about what I saw. But now, as the world considers freeing Iraq from Saddam's rule, I feel compelled to bear witness to the last time Iraqis tried to liberate their country. \nIn February 1991, I was living with my grandparents in Karbala, a city of roughly 350,000 an hour southwest of Baghdad. The Gulf war was raging, and my family and I often listened to Voice of America for news free of Iraqi-government control. We heard President George H.W. Bush repeatedly assure us that if the Iraqi people rose up against Saddam, the United States stood ready to help them. 'There's another way for the bloodshed to stop,' Bush had said, 'and that is for the Iraqi military and the Iraqi people to take matters into their own hands and force Saddam Hussein, the dictator, to step aside.' I was excited by Bush's words, but, after two decades of living under the brutal rule of Saddam's Baath Party, it was impossible for me to imagine we would ever be liberated. Even though millions of Iraqis dreamed of overthrowing Saddam, we were afraid to speak about it and doubted anyone would ever come to help us. I felt the world had abandoned us. \nIf an uprising was going to break out, I thought, it certainly wasn't going to be in Karbala, where security was unusually tight, even for a police state. Saddam had special reason to worry about Karbala. For centuries, Karbala has been a sacred place for Shiite Muslims, who are largely shut out from the upper levels of Iraq's secular, Sunni-dominated regime. Karbala is home to two sacred shrines that honor two of the key figures in Shiite history, Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas; many elderly Shiites retire to Karbala to spend the last years of their lives as 'neighbors' to Imam Hussein before being buried in one of the city's vast cemeteries. Because of the shrines, Iran refrained from bombing Karbala during its war with Iraq, a decision that only made Saddam more suspicious of Karbala residents. \nBecause of the city's large percentage of Shiites, the Iraqi government has used every method possible to demonstrate its control of Karbala. Every year, on the anniversary of Imam Hussein's martyrdom, Shiites observe ten days of mourning; during this period, Shiites perform the Aza, a passion play that depicts events leading up to the imam's murder. When Saddam came to power, he banned public performances of the Aza. Saddam also left his mark on the shrines honoring Imam Hussein and Abbas, which were infiltrated by the secret police. Built around their two graves, the shrines were once elaborate constructions topped with golden domes, but now the gold tiles have been removed and replaced with counterfeit metal. Although the shrines remained open to worshippers, when I would visit them I saw rooms within the buildings that had been used by secret police for interrogation--signs the police were prepared to clamp down hard on any Shiite agitation. \nEven by Iraqi standards, Karbala was claustrophobic--in Karbala, even more than in the rest of Iraq, you learned not to trust anyone. Though the secret police set up shop in the two shrines, they had a pervasive presence in all parts of the city. The city crawled with informers. Anyone you met--in the streets, in school, at the mosques--might be an agent of the secret police, whose ranks ranged from teenage boys to elderly grandmothers. At my high school, I felt enormous pressure to join Saddam's Baath Party. I was not allowed to receive my high school diploma unless I signed up for the party. I refused because I didn't want my name associated in any way with Saddam's crimes. The high school officials denied me my diploma and forced me to sign a document stating that if I joined any other political party, the regime had the right to kill me. This document was added to my school file, and I thereafter tried to keep a low profile because I felt informers were watching me. \nOn March 1, 1991, I was fasting and praying with other women in the shrine of Imam Hussein. That day, I was reading prayers for illiterate women, a custom I had performed since childhood. Suddenly, a woman ran into the mosque and announced, 'Our army has pulled out of Kuwait.' \nI burst into tears--not out of regret for the Iraqi army, but because I had hoped Saddam's regime might fall while most of his military was in Kuwait. During the Gulf war, we frequently saw young men in the street who had deserted the Iraqi army in Kuwait and returned to their hometown. Now, I worried, with the war over, there would be less reason for people to desert the army, and the elite Republican Guard would return and increase Saddam's control over the country. My hopes of freedom seemed to fade. \nI was still crying when I left the shrine. I was turning 20 the next day, and I suddenly understood that I had no future in Iraq. As long as Saddam ruled, I could not live as a free person. I had no diploma, I couldn't speak openly about my political and religious beliefs, and my relatives could--and did--disappear at any given minute. Iraq under Saddam was a dead end. \nI cried all the way home. People stared at me on the street as tears soaked my hijab. It may be hard for non-Iraqis to understand why I was so distraught, why I could not imagine continuing to live under Saddam's rule. But the years of war with Iran, Kuwait, and now the United States and its allies, coupled with Saddam's brutal war against his own people, had sucked the life out of me. And the news that the army would be returning from Kuwait intact meant that my limited hope for freedom was now crushed. \nImam Hussein's shrine had always been my place of comfort, and, on March 3, I went back to pray. Walking along Shara'a Al Abbas, Karbala's main street, I noticed that the mood was tense. The street was filled with more secret police than usual. They stood around and talked nervously. \nAfternoon prayers that day in Imam Hussein's shrine lasted only one hour, and then the soldiers immediately kicked us out. I had never seen the shrine shut down like this--the tension in Karbala was rising fast. As I left the shrine, I saw a tank and machine guns stationed in the center of the city. The moment I returned home, I tuned in to the Voice of Free Iraq, an opposition radio station that had started broadcasting out of Cyprus in January 1991, and learned that an uprising had started in Basra and spread north and east to the cities along the Iranian border. Evidently, people across Iraq had decided that now was the time to act, before all the troops could return from Kuwait. Here was a window to make a difference, while Saddam's army was still in retreat and the president of the United States was promising support. 'This is amazing,' I thought. 'Will our turn ever come?' \nTwo days later, on March 5, as I was having breakfast, our neighbor Umali came to see us. Umali's family was originally from Iran, and, although Saddam had expelled many people we thought were of Iranian origin years earlier, she had paid a bribe to continue living in Karbala. 'They are coming!' she told me. 'Who?' I asked. 'The uprising fighters. They have already liberated Basra and Najaf, and now they are coming to Karbala.' I didn't know who exactly these fighters were, but, as I would later see with my own eyes, they were a loose coalition of regular Iraqis of all backgrounds--soldiers who had deserted, high school students, and older people who could still remember a time before Baath Party rule--who had risen up with little organization and now were moving across the area. \nI jumped up and ran outside. The streets were filled with troops, secret police, and heavy weaponry. Guns were drawn. Soldiers were shouting into loudspeakers, ordering everyone to return to their houses and shut their doors. To my surprise, dozens of young men were defying the soldiers and urging people to remain outside. \nWhen I returned home to change into pants and boots, my grandfather tried to stop me from leaving. 'Come back!' he shouted at me. 'Don't do this. This will not take you anywhere.' My grandfather survived decades of Iraq's internal battles by refusing to get involved in politics. He knew that what was about to happen could lead to a bad ending. \nOvercome with anger, I told myself that I had a choice. By joining the young men, I could show I wanted to live as a free person. A rebellion had begun in Karbala, and I made a conscious decision to be a part of it. As I left the house, I saw groups of men, mostly local Shiites, who had heard of the uprising in Basra and gathered in Karbala to join the rebellion. Many were teenagers, and they carried whatever they could find--sticks, axes, knives, even curtain rods. A few had guns. 'God is great!' they shouted. 'We swear by God, we will never forget Hussein!' \nI was the only woman in the street, surrounded by mobs of men. 'Who are you?' they asked me. 'What are you doing here? This isn't your place.' 'This is my fight, too,' I told them. 'I am with you.' \nWith makeshift weapons and our own bodies, we began to confront the Iraqi soldiers who had entered the town in recent days yet who were already weakened by weeks of allied bombing, desertions, and the army's withdrawal from Kuwait. The soldiers started firing on the crowd--the first time I had ever seen live shooting. Caught up in the frenzy of noise and excitement, I didn't run for cover. Instead, I kept shouting along with the others, 'Down with Saddam!' Years of anger within me came pouring out. \nEven with its guns, the army was no match for us that day. The angry crowds surged toward the soldiers' trucks and jeeps despite the rain of bullets. They swarmed en masse all over the military's vehicles and forced the troops out of their cars so that the soldiers could not possibly shoot at all the waves of rebels. Many soldiers threw down their weapons and ran off down the street, chased by the crowd. Many were caught and some were beaten; most who were captured were taken to the Imam Hussein shrine, which became a makeshift headquarters for the rebels and a detention center for army troops. I saw one older soldier who escaped the crowds banging on my neighbor's door, crying. He asked to be hidden or at least given some civilian clothes that might save him. \nWith the army on the run, it became easier for us to get weapons. During the Gulf war, Saddam had stored many of his weapons in places the United States and its allies would never dare bomb: elementary and high schools. Guards who used to work at the schools began emptying the school storage rooms and passing us everything from Kalashnikov rifles to grenade launchers. The guns would be necessary: Though many of the soldiers had run off, I saw that some were still putting up resistance to the rebels, and they were increasingly joined by Baath Party civilian militias and members of the town's secret police. For the Baath members and the secret police, their existence depended on Saddam staying in power, so they holed up inside Karbala's city hall and other municipal buildings and fired into the crowds in the street, maiming and killing as many people as they could. Later that night, many attempted to flee but were killed or captured by the rebels. \nBy late afternoon on March 5, when the situation had calmed down a little, I returned home. My grandmother had been worried sick about me, but I told her not to worry. 'If I live, I want to live in freedom,' I said. 'Otherwise, why bother?' 'But,' she argued with me, 'none of this is organized!' I responded passionately, 'Remember what President Bush said? If we rise up against Saddam, the Americans will help us.' \nI felt this was an historic moment for the Iraqi people, and I wanted to record it. So I grabbed my family's camcorder and started filming the scene in the streets, where people were dancing and shouting in celebration after many of the troops retreated. Cars honked, people handed out sweets, and women and children hugged and kissed. Walking around with the camcorder, I felt as if I were taping an enormous wedding celebration. Despite the joy, there were many people who had been killed and injured in the initial rush at the army troops. Wounded rebels, army soldiers, and Baath Party members lay in the streets. I told people to carry two of the injured men back to a mosque my family ran. But my grandfather, who wanted no part of the uprising, had taken the keys so that no one could bring the wounded inside. I went into our house, entered the mosque through a back passage, and opened the building's big blue doors. As they swung open, a crowd of what seemed to be hundreds of people rushed in, many limping because of their wounds. With the few supplies we had, we administered first aid. Some people suffered from severe chest and leg wounds and needed to go to the hospital, but nobody dared to drive in the midst of the persistent shooting. \nAs night fell and the city grew quiet, a great fear set in--a fear fostered by years of living in Iraq. We wondered who in the mosque was really with us and who was against us. Would someone burst into the mosque and try to kill us? Would someone amongst us turn on the group and inform the Baath Party members and other people allied with Saddam where we were? Most of us were strangers to each other. Some of the people in our group, of course, had worked for the secret police--with so many Iraqis in one room, some would have worked for the security services. I treated one secret policeman, Naji, who was shaking with fright as I touched him. He was convinced we were going to kill him as we tried to wrap his wounds. 'Don't be scared,' we told him. 'We are not like you.' Naji had expected us to act just like the Baath police. 'May God protect you,' he sighed in relief. \nThat night, I mobilized our family's servants to cook food, help clean up the blood in the mosque, and put out mattresses. I ran into the house, got pillows, and ripped the cotton out of them, which we used to dress the wounds. \nAll this time, my grandfather stayed in the house. Sometimes he would bang lightly on the mosque door and whisper, 'Make them leave. This will be bad for you. Saddam will come back.' What he was saying was logical, given Iraq's history, but I didn't want to listen. I was exulting in what I thought was a moment of freedom, and I pretended not to hear him and continued helping the wounded. Eventually he ignored us, and, when things got quieter, I sat with other members of the group in the prayer hall of the mosque while each person told his or her history. Soon we were telling jokes we recalled from the Voice of Free Iraq. \nIt may not sound dramatic, but talking together openly was a completely new experience for us. For years we had lived in a society of informers, where nobody could be trusted. Now, we were getting to know each other for the first time. \nThat first night of the uprising was the first time I ever saw Iraqis reveal themselves to one another and talk openly about who we were and what had happened to us and our families. Our neighbor, Said, a former army general, told us he had been jailed for ten years for refusing to join the Baath Party while he was in the military. I was shocked to find out he'd been in prison; I had always thought of him merely as our strange, aloof neighbor. Two of the injured men, Sami and Hazam, recounted their experiences. Years before, Sami had been jailed for no reason and had spent four years in prison. He described how prison guards had beaten him, tied him to a ceiling fan, and then turned it on. Hazam had also been imprisoned. He later joined the army to get out of prison but deserted when the military invaded Kuwait. Now he was hiding in Karbala. \nThat night, we also discussed some of our hopes and visions for the future of Iraq. A medical student named Ali, who had come to the mosque and volunteered to treat the wounded, joked, 'When we capture Saddam, we'll charge five dollars to everyone who wants to spit on him.' We all started laughing because previously nobody had ever dared to make jokes like this. Ali continued, 'If someone wants to kick him, ten dollars. That's how we'll raise the money to rebuild Iraq.' \nWe were sure it was only a matter of time before the Americans arrived, and we were already thinking about how to build a democratic society. We talked about all the people who had been thrown out of the country over the last four decades--Jews and Shiites. Many of these people had lived in Iraq for generations, but their property was confiscated when they were forced to leave. Some, of course, never even got the chance to leave--they were executed in Iraq. We spoke quietly so the injured could sleep. \nIn the morning, on March 6, we sent two men to get medicine from a nearby pharmacy and others to look for any ambulances that were still operating. Ali's sister was a pharmacist, and some men from our group smashed open her store, which had been boarded up as the uprising began, to obtain medical supplies. When they returned to the mosque, we were able to begin seriously treating the wounded and taking them to the hospital. \nDespite our excitement, we could not forget our worries about the night before. While people were taking the wounded to the hospital, I made sure we cleaned up everything in the mosque. I told our family's servants, 'I don't want there to be any trace of blood or any evidence that people were here overnight.' After we scrubbed the floors, we gathered all of our makeshift bandages and burned them in our family's oven. \nLater that morning, I walked over to the city jail. The front door was open, and most of the guards had fled, leaving the prisoners alone. At first, the remaining guards wouldn't let me in because I was a woman, but, when I insisted, they backed down. I explored the jail for over an hour. It was a huge building with many floors. People were wandering through the halls, and inmates were banging on the walls of their cells, yelling to be let out. There were prisoners from many countries--Kuwaitis, Saudis, Palestinians, Jordanians, Egyptians, and even a few Europeans who had been arrested during the invasion of Kuwait and shipped to Karbala. Although there were still a few cowed guards around, everyone was being freed by members of the uprising who had come to the jail over the past day. One man, a Kuwaiti, told me he had come to Iraq to check on his brother, a prisoner of war from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. He was arrested and held for three months; prison guards tortured him every day. 'Get out of the city,' I told him. 'It's not safe.' I pointed him in the direction of the U.S.-held zone in southern Iraq. \nSome of the older prisoners didn't even know what year it was. Some prisoners no longer remembered why they were imprisoned in the first place. \nAs I wandered around the jail, some of the liberated prisoners gave us a tour. I saw huge meat grinders that fed into a septic tank and rooms I believe were used for sexual abuse. Instruction manuals on how to use torture devices were posted on the wall. A terrible smell was everywhere. Here before me was the dark secret of Saddam's Iraq. I felt sick but free. Now, I thought, these rooms will never be used again. \nWalking out into the street, I saw that people were still celebrating, but they were also waiting for U.S. support, support needed to prevent the army from returning and to allow the uprising to move to other cities in the heart of Iraq. People became anxious, not knowing what to expect. The strange reality of the uprising, with its hope and joy, its danger and uncertainty, unleashed a mix of emotions. Many of the rebels were eager to destroy the people who had terrorized us for years, and they tried to kill as many soldiers and government agents as possible. There were revenge killings in which families murdered the secret-police agents who had killed their relatives. When I visited the hospital on the second day of the uprising to give blood, I saw the corpse of Jabbar, a well-known local informer, lying in the hospital's courtyard. A local man wanted to use his car to run over Jabbar's dead body. \nOther rebels showed mercy, protecting some government workers and helping them hide from angry mobs. It seemed to me that some of the uprising fighters tried not to imitate the ways of our oppressors. Instead of using the police station as their base, they used the two shrines. Instead of summarily executing all of Saddam's soldiers, informers, and secret agents in town, they arrested some--though they also killed many. I saw people cooking in the streets and giving out food to strangers. I had never seen Iraqis standing together like this, but then I had never seen Iraqis experience any semblance of freedom. \nAs the conflict in Karbala wore on, our fear intensified. By the third day of the uprising, it was only a matter of time, we thought, before Saddam's troops arrived en masse to destroy us. Where were the Americans who had promised to come to our aid? Depression began to set in. We waited and waited--for the Americans, for international help, for food, for water, and for medical supplies. The hours grew longer and longer. \nBy the fifth day, March 9, regiments of the Iraqi army loyal to Saddam arrived on the outskirts of Karbala and started bombing the city from a distance. Under cover of artillery fire, they began sending deployments of soldiers into the city. When I returned home, I saw two soldiers trying to shoot my neighbor, Said. I yelled at him to be careful as shots hit his hand. One of the soldiers shot at me, and the bullet grazed my cheek. At first I didn't even notice it. But Said called out to me, 'My daughter, something is coming out of your face.' I touched my hand to my cheek and felt blood. \nAround 4:30 in the afternoon, tanks from the Republican Guard, Saddam's most devoted troops, started rumbling down Karbala's main street. A group of us gathered outside as Said, the former general, assigned positions to the men. 'I don't want to hear a single shot until all the tanks are in,' he told us. 'Tanks are good in deserts and open spaces, but they're terrible in the streets. Don't attack until all the tanks are trapped.' Said had been in the army when it still had a strong British influence. \nSaid asked for volunteers to bomb one of the tanks. 'Who will stay with me?' he asked. I stepped forward, but he was skeptical. 'You've been shot and you're a woman,' he told me. 'But you need me here now, and you don't have anyone else,' I replied. He reluctantly agreed to let me try. \nI went up to the roof above the tank I was assigned to bomb. I watched as the other fighters down the street ambushed the tanks, one by one. Suddenly it was my turn. I pulled the pin and threw the grenade. The grenade hit its target. There were fires and explosions everywhere. There was a jolt through my body. For three hours I couldn't move and stayed hidden behind the wall; I just sat there praying. What had become of me? A 20-year-old woman, desperate for a future that was now slipping away, tossing grenades and vainly trying to hold off the tragedy that I realized was about to come. \nBy now, it was clear the Americans were not coming. President Bush had promised to help us if we rose up against Saddam, and we had believed him. But the help never arrived. American troops did not interfere as Saddam turned his helicopters and tanks against us, sending more and more regiments of his troops to Karbala. With no commerce and no help from the world, our supplies were running out, our energy was gone, and our momentum had disappeared. Troops loyal to Saddam began swarming through the city as the residents of Karbala fled. Within a few days, the uprising was crushed. Now it was about our own survival. We said goodbye, cried, and spread out on our own. \nSaddam assigned the responsibility for Karbala to his son-in-law, Hussein Kamel, who quickly made an example of the resistance fighters, having troops shoot on sight anyone accused of being in the resistance. Kamel also let the bodies of those rebels shot during the uprising lie untouched in the streets as a reminder to the populace of what happened to people who rose up. I saw stray dogs approach the bodies and start eating them. \nTo escape Karbala, 20 family members, friends, and I crammed into a car built for five. The son of an army general, who was a close friend, drove us out of Karbala through a hail of bullets. At checkpoints just outside the city, guards screamed at us, but, when the driver showed his army credentials, we passed through. \nThe next few months were difficult, as the secret police hunted uprising fighters across the country. People told me that they entered our home in Karbala and took everything. Friends in Karbala told me that secret police rounded up people regardless of whether they had fought in the uprising. One family friend returned home to his family in Karbala months later. The next day, the secret police took him to prison. Someone had told them he participated in the uprising, and he was tortured for 45 days, each day denying their accusations. One day a taxi driver knocked on the family's door. 'Pull your son out of my car,' the driver said, 'because he can't move.' In prison, the family friend had lost his mind. He stayed curled up, friends told me, crying like a baby and yelling, 'I want my mommy!' \nWe could hardly get beyond Karbala's outskirts, so I hid in a small home outside the city, covering my face and sleeping in a secret room. All my hopes and dreams had seemed so close, but now they were crushed. The spirit had been sucked out of me, but, to keep from getting depressed while I hid, I spent hours writing poetry, waiting for the opportunity to escape. I kept thinking about the bizarre window of freedom I had just experienced: Iraq without Saddam's rule, the joy of liberation, the anger of many people after two decades of repression, the way in which we spontaneously organized, the feeling of being open with neighbors and complete strangers, the sight of the prisoners and the human meat grinders. \nEventually, the border to Jordan was reopened, and I seized the chance to flee Iraq. At the border, I had to bribe the border guard to ignore my name on a list of people who were not allowed to leave the country. I was out, but I felt dead inside. \nThe surviving veterans of the uprising scattered across Iraq and around the world. Sometimes I hear from a fellow refugee in California or Michigan who also participated in the uprising. But mostly there is silence. We thought if we forgot about the past--or at least stopped talking about it--it would go away. But now the weapons-inspection crisis has reached a boil. Could it possibly be that President George W. Bush will bring justice and liberation where his father failed? \nAmerica's showdown with Saddam has evoked all the emotions from March 1991 that I have tried so long to forget. They remind me of the diary I kept during the uprising. I made a point of writing in it every day because I believed we were making history. I wanted to preserve those moments so that I would never forget the first precious days of freedom. I wrote every day at noon, if I could, or at night, by candlelight. After the uprising failed, when I was on the run and cut off from my family, this diary was all that I had. \nThe night before I left Iraq, I burned my diary in an oven, page by page. Anyone caught with such a document would be killed. In all, I burned over 200 pages--full of details about what I had seen and done in Karbala. As the pages went up in flames, tears streamed down my face. \nFor many years, I have tried to forget what I wrote in those pages. But I can never erase those memories. Sometimes I feel I am back in Karbala. We are waiting for the Americans once again. \nZainab Al-Suwaij is executive director of the American Islamic Congress. \nCopyright 2002, The New Republic",

        "blog_text": "For the last few months I have spent every morning with “Frank,” an Alzheimer’s patient.  Frank is 80 years old and was never married.  He loves God, golf, and women…but probably not in that order!  Every day, I go to his assisted living facility, pick him up, and take him to the golf course.  Before I met Frank, I had never even been to a golf course, much less ever played.  However, thanks to Frank I am now a not-too-horrible novice who is too cheap to ever make this a habit!  Frank is an item for discussion because of what he is teaching me about being a living, breathing, remembering, human being.  Since this website is dedicated to exploring theological thought, I decided it would be good for my first real entry to pause and be thankful for the mind each of us have.  I didn’t know Frank’s medical diagnosis when I first started working with him.  However, I began very quickly to suspect Alzheimer’s.  The true defining moment in my work with him came when I took him to see his specialist.  (Since Frank was never married, his only surviving family is his sister who lives three hours away…therefore, I took care of taking him to doctors, and I would then report to his sister about what the doctors said.)  As we were sitting with the doctor, I hoped that the doctor understood how much memory problems Frank had been having.  I worried because Frank was saying things like, “Everybody forgets things now and then.  Its just part of being old.”  I was worried the doctor didn’t even know that Frank had a problem.  But, I was wrong.  The doctor, whose professionalism I can’t even begin to recreate here, proceeded to remind Frank what he actually already knew…that he had Early-Middle Stage Alzheimer’s.  The doctor then proceeded to explain the treatment options available.  After he finished, Frank said, “Well it doesn’t really matter because I’m not going to be around much longer anyway…I’m pretty old.”  The doctor then said that we all need to make the best of whatever time we have left, and then he asked, “Frank, you said you’re old…how old are you?”  Frank stumbled for several seconds and then said, “You know I have a hard time remembering…let’s see I was born in 1923…”  “That’s right,” the doctor said encouragingly, “so how old does that make you?”  There was a long pause, and the doctor finally broke in and said, “What year is it, Frank?”  Frank responded, “You know, I have a hard time remembering that.  I’m just not quite sure how old I am.”  “Well,” said the doctor, “how old do you think you are?  Just guess.”  “Umm, I think I’m about 67,” Frank said incorrectly.  At that point, sitting across the room from Frank, I fought back tears.  Frank’s loss of memory was robbing him of self-identity.  I realized afresh the fragility of this life, and even more, the fragility of the mind.  I am a bit of an intellectual.  I enjoy thinking, rationalizing, problem solving, and learning.  This is a gift.  Often, we let our ability to think be an instrument of division.  We theorize reasons why this person or that person is not correct like we think we are.  Or, we drum up a platform that is superior to others’ ideas about what is best for our church, country, or whatever.  What’s even worse, I do this as badly as the next gal.  I grew up being taught how to do this by my church, my school, my society, my political party, by everyone.  Frank taught me something that day.  He taught me to cherish every moment and every thought and every memory.  Our ability to think should not primarily be used as a weapon, but rather it should be used as a way to bless the lives of others.  There are no guarantees in this life (except death and taxes, I know), and we must remember to savor our days, our friends, even our enemies, and know that each thought is a gift.  Hopefully, my theological meandering on this site will never lose sight of this lesson.",

When you play it yourself - or in my case, try to play it - you understand a little better when you hear others play it. Even Top-40 stuff sounds more interesting. Along those lines I found this today, Though I think I would have always dug this band, [The Kings of Leon - ed.]these days I find I can really hear them,. I am aware of each note; I can feel the separation of the instruments; sense what Caleb and Matthew Followill are doing on their guitars; take it all apart and put it back together; and it’s all due to the few months Jack and I have spend whacking our own geetars. Over the past couple of years, drawing has done the same for my appreciation for art, focusing my likes but quelling my dislikes, broadening my mind and letting me see what I would have formerly walked past or dismissed. I feel increasingly less intimidated by the heavy intellectualism of a lot of contemporary art and get a lot more pleasure whenever I’m in a museum. You don’t have to be a musician to love music or an artist to love art or a writer to enjoy a novel, but when you try to make it yourself, even in the most rudimentary way, it enhances what you get out of really great Art.

This means that as far as the events depicted in the scenarios featured in this activity are concerned you are less likely to recommend societal interference in matters of moral wrongdoing, in the form of prevention or punishment, than average. Your Universalising Factor of 0.50 compares to an average Universalising Factor of 0.37. This means you are more likely than average to see moral wrongdoing in universal terms - that is, without regard to prevailing cultural norms and social conventions (at least as far as the events depicted in the scenarios featured in this activity are concerned). Their results are largely consistent with how I think of myself. If you intend to take the quiz yourself, you should stop reading this post first, as my reasoning may temporarily influence your own. Mostly I tried to look at the questions based on whether a person was internally consistent. I believe what I believe, but don't believe that other people should be held to my standards or judged by my beliefs. I do however believe they should be accountable to their own values. Few things irk me more than people violating their own stated beliefs and values. If you don't intend to act in a certain way, don't pretend that you will. In one example from the quiz, it appears I am definitely in the minority in this respect: You judged the failure of the son to visit his mother's grave once a week as he promised to be wrong. 12% of the people who have undertaken this activity to date agree with you. In that same light I believe that people should not judge others just because they have different values and priorities. I am tired of those who hate people, or entire cultures, who share different values than themselves. As such they develop a strong hatred towards those people or cultures that seems to make them look for everything wrong with their beliefs. They then readily accept any negative suggestion and dismiss out of hand any positive result of those beliefs. No way of doing something is perfect. Some ways are distinctly better than others. Promoting hatred however is no way to get people to look at things differently. Hatred creates stubbornness, and makes people resistant to change, not more accepting to it.",

        "blog_text": "(copied and maybe edited a little from my journal,  a few minutes before the 21st of April  in my room in Misasagi, Yamashina, Kyoto City)  I don't know how to write anymore. I mean I can still write and I want to write, but I don't know how to put it down on paper. I mean literally put pen on paper and produce paragraphs. (See, I can't even tell you coherently what I want anymore--literally and figuratively.)  I guess I've lost my patience. I've lost it all over again---the patience to sort out thoughts, to look for and choose the right words, to construct sentences and know when to insert significant pauses, and yes, even the patience to skip a line and create a space between paragraphs. I've lost it all. (If you could only see how awful my handwriting is.)  Is this all really true, you wonder? How can somebody who claim not to know how to write, write three consecutive entries in her blog? You don't get it. Sure, I can type it all up in a keyboard, bang on Enter and clack up Tab and Backspace and choose letters from A to Z, choose the #!.,@='&)* punctuations. I even have the patience for your old ctrl-alt-delete routine, should something go awry.  But I've lost my patience for that magical time it takes to form that secret, silent thought to the chosen, hushed, uttered word, and finally to that again-silent, unerasable, written testimony. (If you could see me sweating it out now, only to complete this routine.)  Where did all that go? Did I lose my muse, as Lyra did? Am I less lonely here? (Yeah, could've fooled me. I would jump and stop all this nonsense right now if the phone rang, but that's another story.)  Before this entry, and I guess even after it, my second journal lies blank except for lists of things to do, people's phone numbers back home, tattoo designs and other crap. Am I losing my memories to other people? The things I've written recently are reports, quizzes, emails, text messages and my shitty blog publications.  Am I losing my memories to other people? Are my moments lost to the confusion and vulnerability and virtuality of cyberspace? Will you even remember this entry, this blog, how  you  felt when you read it after you visit this site, or long after I stop writing here, or forget my password, or when all the ads pull out and this blog has to shut down? Will you? Will I?  I will perhaps one day, fill all these blank journal pages, even throw it away or burn it, but I believe that once written, words can never be taken back. You can admit something by saying it, but you can never, and I mean  never  deny something you have written. Your handwriting will stare back at you and force you to acknowledge it as your own. Even the slightest memories will rush up and squeeze your throat, reminding you when and what you were feeling when you wrote that piece. Pen and paper will be ready to answer a subpoena to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth about what you wrote, god help them.  It could be that all this shit is laughable and untrue and just plain bullshit by next week, two years from now, tomorrow, or even in the next minute, but you and I will know that the minute I finish all this (the minute a click on Publish your Post), that this is how I felt, how I was thinking that very moment I was sweating it out to write this. And perhaps I won't remember as clearly how I struggled, or how difficult this was, but I will never be able to deny this experience again. Ever.  There's this song by Jonny Lang that talks about this girl, writing on her journal, pouring out all her secret ambitions and deepest thoughts, when suddenly the piece of paper flies out the window. She feels bad about this ('A part of your heart/All alone in the night' he sings), but suddenly imagines what if, what if, somebody finds it and reads it and it makes him/her smile, or laugh, or cry or even just nod his/her head in agreement. And suddenly she doesn't mind it being lost at all, because she knows it's not, having written it and confirmed it, and knowing somebody will find it and read it and somehow confirm her, too.  (Right here, about right this time, you'll begin to think,  Whew finally, she'll stop all this angst, all this unproductive anger. She's found that crutch, that part of the story, where you can breath easy and be ready to hear the moral.  Well, fuck, you're in for a disappointment. Let me tell you now, in case you want to stop reading this, I am not finished, I will perhaps never be finished with angst.)  But needless to say, all of the above was a fucking song, and what are the chances that somebody who finds what I've written will really care about what I wrote, or will even  read  what I wrote, or even recognize the stuff between the lines (will they even know that there are stuff between the lines?). What are the chances somebody will even  find  that blown away piece of paper? You know that in real life it'll probably get stepped, trampled, spit on and end up wet and dirty and crumpled and unreadable in some corner, waiting for the rain or the wind to take it somewhere where it can die with dignity. If your piece of paper's lucky, this is what will probably happen. Or someone could find it and use it to pick up their dog's shit in the park.  I know that life doesn't offer guarantees. Hell, the six-year-old understands that right after you tell her there's no Santa.  And I know that that's one of the more beautiful and brilliant things about it sometimes. But tonight it's fucking cold and I've got the cough and I can't finish one cigarette for the burning in my throat.  Yeah, life takes your money and sometimes screws you over. Like that doctor telling me I'm fine and don't need medicine.  I could use some sleep inducers tonight.",

I have been, in the words of one of my 'friends' (you'll see why I use inverted commas later) a jumped up backstabbing dick. I think this email, sent to me after a pathetic dispute over... well the email explains all: \nDear Richard \nYou may be correct, it may be us that owe you an apology, and i am sure that we were all prepared to talk about this like sensible adults. However, you may think that you are being mature by sending around an email telling us that we are pathetic, but for once could you maybe take a step back from your seemingly bottomless pit of knowledge, and the attitude that you always know best, and think to yourself 'Maybe i am the pathetic one?' \nFor example how did this whole situation spawn, well i can tell you quite easily, it began when we very kindly invited you to come on our holiday with us in the forthcoming summer, what a nice gesture. Obviously not. Somehow you managed to fabricate the idea in your own mind that we didn't want you there, which we obviously didn't considering that we invited you! You then went on to moan about the cost, location, and company which would also rather piss you off somewhat if anyone else had gone about acting in the same 'pathetic' manner. When asked if you would be attending the trip by myself and Richard you went on to kick a chair, slam a door and then go and tell Adam and Simon that they wern't invited. Very mature. I feel that what you did to them was the biggest backstabbing action which you could have taken, very noble considering that you were supposedly good friends with all of the people on the trip. As you can tell this pissed all of us off just that little bit more, but still i was prepared to hear your side of the story so i came and found you in your history room where YOU found it interesting to bombard Amy and myself with abuse, yet again another honorable action. \nThen i attended Science today happy in the knowledge that i would see my good friends Richard and Polly. However, as you may know the mood turned rather sour when you found my very funny joke somewhat unfunny and went about hitting me in the face.(Which i must add was a pathetic punch) \nI feel that the trouble with you Richard is that you are somewhat insecure about yourself, your exact words were 'I'm not really bothered by what you are saying, it means nothing to me' if you not bloody bothered then why hit me in the face you idiot if your not bothered then why get in such a shit about everything, why do you make everything worse for yourself squaring up to my best friend storming off in a rage, we are not trying to upset you, it is called a joke if you wern't so pathetic and took it all with a pinch of salt people wouldn't know that it got to you, so wouldn't drill the same old insult, personally your poncy little spack today just made the joke twice as funny, as did it for everybody else in the square after you walked off, hopeing to leave in some sort of dramatic fashion when actually all you did was make yourself look like a complete twat. You wonder why people call you boring, or moody it seems inconceivable to me that you can't see why, this time last week i still thought that you were a genuine decent bloke but you just went and made yourself look like a complete idiot by trying to make somesort of noble stand, resulting, as per usual in everybody else laughing behind your back. \nRichard C was right from the very beginning when he told me that you could be a jumped up backstabbing dick, i gave you the benefit of the doubt, but you had to go and shove a number of friendships right up your own ass. Pathetic. \nWritten by Nik \nagreed by Richard \nThe joke he is refering to by the way, is writing nazi on a photograph of me and drawing a swastika.  I do have to admit he has exagerated these facts ever so slightly, yet it remains me who is the one who needs to apoligise. Considering my actions of the past few days, weeks even, I can see and I do realise that I have behaved in a manner that isn't appropriate, isn't friendly and a manner I simply should not have behaved in. I have apoligised to these people, but I doubt my apoligies will mean much. \nI need to consider to myself, what do I want to get from this life? Happiness of course, and if this is what I want, why I am going about it like this, clearly the wrong way. Why am i ruining friendships that took an age to build, with people I actually do get on with, despite thier frequent need for racist comments. I have decided the best strategy by far is too keep my head down until way after exams now, but I'm not sure they'll have the same idea. It seems to me that I have taken a feeling of self belief too far and stepped in the realm of feeling some kind or arrogant self importance.  Things need to change, and they need to change now, I can only hope that I can change myself before I lose even more friends.",

        "blog_text": "A drive back home - Abe Maslow Navigating, Me Driving. Was dropping a friend home a few days back, she recently finished her graduation-post graduation rigmarole. So is officially now on the job-market, seeking gainful employment. This particular friend is nice and sorts, but she is not one who is (I don’t know how to say this) evolved. You know? I mean she is one who is comfortable and content with catching a movie, going to a discotheque. Not necessarily one who would philosophize, analyze or hypothesize on say an event, a movie, a piece of music or a book. But of course, she is talented and accomplished in her own way(s). I mean she is more Sarat Chandra’s Rajlokhi than Kamal Lata. More earthy than ethereal, more gut feeling than cerebral musings. So at a traffic snarl, I asked her “So what you planning to do, now that your course is done?” She: “I think the O&M job will happen”. Me: “Okay that’s great then, I mean you couldn’t want better, in your line of work can you?” She: “Yeah” Me: “What you glum faced about, got a great job around the corner, getting married next year?” (To fairly long time boyfriend I must add) She: “Then what?” Me: “Then what…meaning what? Good job, good money, happy married life. Kids. What else?” She: “Is that it? What’s great in that? That can happen to everybody and anybody” “Great” + “Woman”. I think Martina Navaratilova. I have this mental-map thing, a woman talks about “greatness”. She must want to be like Martina Navaratilova! I mean the woman ruled the courts for decades in probably the Golden Era of Woman’s Tennis, made a comeback when everybody, from John Mc in the press box to the guy who sweeps the stands, had written her off. And second only to Billie Jean King by way of being the public face of the Women’s tennis movement. Yes there was Steffi Graf and Chris Evert, but they relegated themselves to star-invitees at the Grammies after they hung up their rackets. There were a couple of designer brands thrown in too. Brand Ambassador monkey business. Okay, digression apart. What my friend said, made me think (a) Is greatness an attribute of “others”, men/women who we read/read about/see on TV, will we never appropriate “greatness” for ourselves? (b) And ever since Abraham Maslow, decided to study human need/evolution/motivation patterns, and put all of us into convenient segments of his famous little triangle. We seem to be comfortably numb in the little psychological pigeonholes he placed us in, and you know what? We like it that way! It helps us calibrate, our degree of association/attitude in regard to other people. He/She is a “Cretin or a Moron”, so I will talk to him about the English Premier League or even better Baywatch! He/She wouldn’t understand Chopin would he/she? I can get away with something sarcastic and nasty maybe, he/she wouldn’t dare retaliate! Alternately, he/she is this outstanding creative genius, a classical musician or a poet or something like that; we would balk at the thought of talking to him/her about “Wet and wild”. Oh gees! No. We should talk Dali or Freud, shouldn’t we? Its incumbent upon us to be in awe of him/her, kiss the very ground he/she walks on. Hmmm…I did the pigeonhole thing for a moment there, she is more the “Rajlokhi”, and so a job and a family life should be enough for her? Makes more sense, eliminates the possibility of a paradox or a fallacy. Rounds of the digits, balances the equation. A “starving artist” is a social oddity, remember? Someone from the other side of the tracks. Bottom line - our own little subconscious/conscious pigeonholing and straightjacketing, makes us more comfortable, more secure, eliminates the unknown and the unexplained. Does not bring forth questions, to which we have no answers. Fits in neatly with the axioms and first principles, which govern OUR world. Maybe that’s why, “WE” ...can never appropriate, far less attain ...“greatness”.",

        "blog_text": "It's been a while since I last wrote. The past two weeks have been a bittersweet and surreal time for me. My last lecture. My last tutorial. My last...  The 'last' list is endless, and the worst 'lasts' are the ones I don't realise until they've past. Two Fridays ago - 23 Oct - was the last COSDU session for this semester and for me (at least for the foreseeable future). It was a mini-affirmation session of sorts. There was plenty of emotion, but it was kept in check partly because time was limited. Lydia asked me after the session why I didn't say anything. Well, I did share a bit, but obviously it was the tip of the iceberg. I told her that if I had said all that I wanted to say, we'd have been at Kenny Lounge the entire night. Also, I personally don't like this idea of finality. It's slow death of sorts. We know it's coming. We know it's inevitable. But affirmation is important. Testimony is important. It's life-giving.  But there are these things called exams, assignments, essays and projects. Which is why we are in University. Or is it? Conventional wisdom dictates that these are the be-all and end-all. What's getting in the way of what? I don't know. Come to think of it, I don't know if what I'm writing is making sense any more. (Taking Sr. Theresa's advice to a good friend and applying it to myself. What you read is usually the result of careful consideration, re-writing and editing. This time, it's just me typing away. It's raw.)  Consider this. I'm procrastinating. I've gone past my personal deadlines but still have ample time to hand in my essays. That leaves me with less time to do important things. Like express my feelings for the friends I will miss when I depart. And yet, I adamantly refuse to write any more testimonials on friendster . Why? Stated reason: I have plenty of other ways to procrastinate. Actual reason: Refusal to let go of friends down under.  So much so that  I considered for just a moment - a brief, fleeting moment during the homily at St. Carthage's on All Souls' Day - about getting a PR and working here.  Nah. Singapore needs me more than this land of golden soil and wealth for toil. And I certainly don't need Australia. Anyway, the crux of all this is time. Too much to do, too little time. Maybe I will write those testimonials. It's not like I'm stressed out by my essays and exams anyway. =P  Fast forward to Exam Mass. Christine spoke about Patsy. It was heart-wrenching stuff. Tears were on the verge of streaming. Perhaps they should have. It's not easy to lower our emotional defences in full view of familiar and not-so-familiar eyes. Lydia gave a heartfelt sharing about the graduating COSDU members. I was touched deeply and completely. If ever any of our involvement with COSDU could be summarised into succinct encomium, Lydia has done so, with humour, eloquence, sincerity and love. Thank you, Lydia.  I wrote the following for the Exam Mass edition of the COSDU newsletter. And I want to share it with everyone. It may be a little repetitive, but it's worth repeating: \nI've been pondering hard about what to write ever since Joanne asked me to pen something - long or short - about COSDU. Somehow, I can't seem to get very far but it's not because I don't have anything good to say. On the contrary, I think there's just too much to say. \nCOSDU has been like a family to me.   No, let me be more precise.  COSDU   is   family to me. There's our Father, God. Plenty of 'mothers' full of care and concern. Brothers and sisters to chat with, to share with, to argue with and to love. We try to be welcoming to all, and we're fiercely protective of our own.  I'm fortunate to have been part of COSDU. I don't think I thank God enough for each and every one of you. Most of you are a short walk or an Optus Time phone call away. I take that for granted sometimes. Soon enough, that will change for those graduating and returning home. \nThat's one of the things I'm going to miss: being in close physical proximity to most of you. It's quite different having lived 'far away' in North Melbourne, compared to my current place in Carlton, at the doorstep of Uni, Chaplaincy, Lygon Street and most importantly, the majority of COSDU. \nIt's going to take some getting used to. Not being able to walk over to kacau others. No Friday night sessions. No monthly mass. No friendly faces in Chaplaincy. No laughs at La Porcella. No waiting to decide if we want to go to La Porcella. No daily lunchtime Rosary or Bible sharing... I could go on. \nWhat I have, what we have, is common experience. We have shared pleasant and not-so-pleasant memories: Easter Camps, Confirmations and Baptisms, the Central Australia trip, the Grampians trip, rockclimbing, movies, meals, sports, watching footy, the Tulip farm, the COSDU forum debacle, committee disagreements, finding out about Sulina's leukaemia. Once again, I could go on. \nSuffice to say, I treasure these. I treasure these because of the people who were with me. I am divided as to whether I should mention names. On one hand, there have been so many individuals who I must mention. People who have listened to me, been there for me, taken care of me, cooked for me... People who have shown their best and worst sides to me and likewise, I have shown my best and worst to them. And yet, we still accept and love each other. \nOn the other hand, I hold everybody in COSDU close to my heart. Even if we are not really close, I have to say that everyone's presence enhances COSDU, makes it a vibrant and loving community. A family. Sometimes, it's just a few words or a smile that can make my day and I wouldn't want to leave out anyone who has in some way been a part of my life. I suppose I'll not mention names here and have a good chat with those I need to thank personally. \nI'm feeling a great sense of loss as I'm writing this. Time is so short. Two weeks remain of my final semester in University. One month of exams, and then... the end? Why did I bother? Isn't it better to have kept to myself? If I didn't risk getting to know others, I wouldn't risk having to part. It's so much easier to do that but that's not what I wanted. When I joined COSDU, I gave my all. For me, if there's no risk in a relationship, it's not love. It's just a mechanical attachment if a relationship is iron-clad. So, in giving my all, I now feel sad that I have to leave. \nAlthough it may be the end of my time in Melbourne, it's not the end of my relationships with friends in COSDU. People just don't come and go. They are only fleeting if we let them drift out of our lives. We don't just live in Carlton or in Parkville. We live in each other's hearts and minds. We can keep in touch... although it won't be the same. Still, it's important to maintain that link. If we don't then it's truly a loss. If we don't, the point of our bonds here seems hopelessly futile. I'm sad to leave but I don't think my relationships here have been in vain. \nAll of you are wonderful. Keep on being a family away from home. Keep on growing in Christ. God Bless!",

        "blog_text": "Squash, cucumbers, and zucchini. All I intended to do was give Mrs. Reynolds the vegetables from our neighbor's garden and be on my way. They weren't washed, and were in a plastic grocery bag. I was just bringing some vegetables to a lonely old lady who lived in a big house behind ours.   I came to the front porch and rang the doorbell. Her old car was in the driveway but no lights were on, so I figured no one was home. It was very hot outside and it was around dinnertime, so I figured that if she was there, she would most likely be having dinner, or in bed already. The door opened. 'Oh, hi, Ms. Toy! I just brought some squash and cucumbers and..' Her face lit up with a joy I cannot explain. 'Oh, come on in, honey!' She said.   I walked into a pristine living room with pretty things that were very breakable. She picked up a cordless phone sitting on the chair next to the door. 'Oh, Elizabeth honey, I've got company here with all sorts of great vegetables who has come to see me! I'll talk to later.' She told me that she had just been 'gabbing with one of her girlfriends' and that she'd love for me to come sit down.  We went into the impeccable kitchen and sat down. No lights were turned on in the entire house. It was around 7:00, but the early evening July sun was still streaming in through the kitchen windows. 'Now, you're the oldest? Madeline?' she asked. 'My, you are just so pretty! I mean, you just have the prettiest face. You certainly have grown into a lovely young lady.' I could tell that my visit was really meaning something to her. She immediately began chatting about her latest health ailments and her daughter who lived down the street and all her different medications. After a lowdown on everyone above age 75 in Sikeston's health, she asked me how my family was doing. 'Oh, pretty well.. Virginia and Charles are getting ready for Camp and we've just been so busy this summer,' I said. 'Well that's what you should be: busy,' she replied with a smile. 'I remember once, maybe three or four years ago, your little brother and his friend were playing in my pebble pile I keep over there by the carport. I keep that pebble pile for my flowers,' she said. 'And I looked out the window and they were scattering my pebbles. So I went outside and kindly asked them to not play in my pebble pile, and before I had even opened my mouth, that little boy shot off through the gate and into your yard! Oh, it was so funny! I've told so many people that story and I get such a kick out of it every time!' I easily imagined my mischevious little brother shooting through the fence. 'Your family is young and y'all should be having all sorts of fun. I remember when my husband was alive, we just loved sitting out on the porch and hearing you kids play in the yard and jump out there on that trampoline. And we loved hearing the Sansagraws across the street in their pool. Reminded us of when our kids were young and we used to go on road trips all over the place.' Her eyes were lit with nostalgia.   She told me stories of her husband with heartfelt detail. 'Yes, those last thirty-seven days seemed like years,' she said while straightening a placemat on the table. 'You never know what life is going to throw at you. I guess you can understand that with your grandfather.' 'So how is your boyfriend doing?' I asked. 'Oh, not well at all,' she said looking down. 'Terminal cancer.' My heart broke into a million pieces. Her husband died six years ago from cancer, and now her boyfriend of one year was being stolen away by it as well. 'Well, maybe he'll get better,' I thought to myself. 'We just love each other's company,' she said smiling. 'Just going to church and eating at each other's houses. And oh we laugh together so much! Last night we were talking on the phone and he was hallucinating from all the morphine he's been getting..' The pieces of my heart broke even more. 'And he was saying all these crazy things! Oh but they were so funny so I just played along with it. And this morning when he had come to his senses we just laughed and laughed!' 'Well that's good, that you are both having fun, especially now,' I said. 'Oh it sure is. Just enjoy life while you can, darlin'.'  She was in the middle of another story when the doorbell rang. 'Please let it not be my sister,' I prayed in my mind. 'Oh look, it's your sister!' she said answering the door. I was sad to leave. I was enjoying listening to her stories and sitting in her pretty home with her new carpet she told me about, and the curtains she sewed herself last winter. But more than anything, I was sad to leave her in that house all by herself. 'You girls come visit me anytime!' she said with a cheerful smile. 'We certainly will,' I replied.   'Were you guys talking the entire time?' my sister asked as we went down the walkway. 'Yep, how long was I there?' I asked. 'Maybe an hour or so,' she replied. 'Well, I really enjoyed being with her,' I said, blinking into the sun.  And as I cut through the yard to my house, my eyes were filled with tears.",

'Eh, your grandfather better help Grandma before she falls down again,' Auntie said. 'They look so cute though,' Kayrn said, moving closer to her boyfriend Kenny. 'He's carrying her purse for her. Look.' I doubled back and looped my arm through Grandma's and we walked together through the dark parking lot. Grandpa was already at the truck, climbing in, ready to go. We had just finished having a family dinner to celebrate Grandma and Grandpa's 50th wedding anniversary. During the dinner I looked at Auntie and said, 'It's a miracle anybody in this family managed to stay married to another person in this family for 50 years.' I've only known Grandma for 23 of those 50 years. Less than 20 if you only count the years I can remember. She and Grandpa went through some rough times. There were moments when the marriage could have collapsed. I remember her shaking sometimes, she was so angry at him, so frustrated. Last year she left him for about a week, went to live with Auntie. He begged her to come back and when she refused he bought her a new washing machine and dryer to woo her back. Grandma was never the type to really leave. If she left, she used to say, her kids would never know their father. The family is the most important thing. This is a belief she passed on to my father. When my parents would argue, Dad would always give in. He couldn't leave his family. I remember when I was a kid I feared his temper and I wished he WOULD leave. Make my life easier. I thought I would never be like my dad. I would go to a mainland college and get a job and never come home. But it hasn't been that way at all. I can never really leave my family either. I always find myself thinking about them, about what they would think about what I'm doing, about what kind of advice they would give me in any given situation. I guess what I am trying to get at is a question I posed to some of my friends awhile back: Whether they thought the stories of their lives began with their birth or years before, with the births of their grandparents or great-grandparents. I think in America there's a tendency to see ourselves as the great Individual. The 50 years of our grandparents' marriage don't matter that much. I thought of that last weekend, when I found myself arm and arm with my grandmother walking through a dark parking lot. About all the things in her life that I don't even know about, that led to my being there with her, the two of us making fun of Grandpa and picking our way over tree roots.

'Ye go straight up this road tae the big roondaboot, take the last exit oan the right, when ye reach the second crossroads turn left then straight oan and yer there.'  The guy looks completely puzzled. I could be talking in Klingon for all he knows so I repeat the instructions, in English, forcing myself to speak slower.  He gets it this time, smiles, thanks me and WHOOOOSH, my bus goes speeding by.  'AW FUCK OFF,' I shout at the rapidly disappearing bus. The tourists assume this is directed at them and do just that. At speed.  So I return to the 'shelter' to sulk. Then two realisations dawn on me.  Firstly, the route I've just given them, so easily recalled, goes right past my front door. Shit, if I'd been thinking I could've got a lift. It's worked before.  Secondly, an obscure memory from my teenage years emerges. Everyone who lives in this city is routinely asked directions by a tourist. Everyone. So my mates and I had devised our own witty response which we always employed, it went:  Tourist: 'Can you tell me how to get to the Castle?'  Us: 'Yeah, do you know where the Western General Hospital is?'  Tourist: 'No.'  Us: 'Good, because the Castle’s nowhere near there. To get to the Castle you go straight down this road...'  Hilarious huh? We thought so.  Not so funny now though. Not when you consider where I'm standing, right now, at this particular bus stop. Can you guess where it's located? Go on, guess.  Yup, I'm standing right outside the fucking Western General Hospital. In the pissing rain. With no bus in sight.  Karma sucks.  Whoops",

        "blog_text": "It's disturbing, to say the least, that the world is watching right now as photos and videos of our troops and commanders humiliating, sodomizing and torturing prisoners in captivity leak out.  The repercussions of this incredible travesty may very well echo out for untold lengths of time, as these indelible images (of 'American inhumanity') burn into the psyche of detractors of American foreign policy around the globe.  Just yesterday, the boldest repercussion was made manifest, as a group claiming to have ties to al-Qaida beheaded a Philadelphian man on video and sent it up on a militant Islamic website.  The savage murderers attributed their actions explicitly to the abuses in Iraq now being publicized.  Disturbingly graphic stills from the video just appeared on an the Drudge Report website today.  What's disturbing even further today is that there are actually people in the American government who look at the many photos circulating now (proof of torture and humiliation by American troops against peoples we are told we are liberating) and don't see anything reprehensible about it.  United States Senator James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, is 'outraged by the outrage' flying about in papers these days.  He claims that a great majority of these prisoners 'have American blood on their hands' and so deserve no special care from their captors and questioners and, in fact, are being justifiably punished.  Rush Limbaugh even goes so far as to compare the abuses to 'fraternity hazing.'   Well, firstly, it certainly violates the Geneva Convention to inflict harm of any inhumane nature (including, of course, torture) on any persons, even insurgents, who have been placed out of combat by detention or injury.  Yes, this means that it is illegal, by internationally recognized mandate, to do what these pictures show American troops doing. And secondly, strapping a college kid to a tree by wrapping him head-to-toe in saran wrap, while humiliating, I'm sure, is kind of a whole load of fun while drunk, as compared with being stripped naked and having vicious barking dogs unleashed to your nether regions.  People line up for hazing rites like those saran wrap antics, not for having legs devoured by dogs.  There's also a report going around that 70 to 90 percent of Iraqi captives were erroneously arrested.  You do the math, folks.  That means that most of the men depicted in these pictures were, according to the Red Cross crew and their authoritative, authentic report, innocent Iraqis mistakenly arrested and held captive, for sometimes months, and subjected to untold lengths of depraved maltreatment.  The question now stands: what do we do now?  It seems to me that, if the latest conclusions are true--that the abuses were delegated from high-up commanders--then this is only further proof that the planning for this war was and still is just atrociously, reprehensibly faulty, and that the Secretary of Defense should get on his knees and beg for a wiser international coalition to come and save this situation before even greater repercussions bear their fruit.",

I have two stoves, two refrigerators, lots of tables and chairs. I think I will try to bring a grill so I can do grilled chicken along with everything else. Speaking of birds...I saved a blackbirds life today...so far. I found one outside as I was leaving . It was struggling to fly and appeared to be injured. Rather than let the stray cat I feed have a treat for dinner, I stuck it in my cat carrier, put a stick up for it to perch on, bird seed and water for it to eat/drink. It was alive when I checked on it a few hours ago. I am hoping it was simply stunned by something and it will be able to fly tomorrow. If the bird is unable to fly...I know of a place about an hour from here that rehabs wildlife. What can I say...Im a softie at heart. Im having fun reading all my old journals.

        "blog_text": "Due to time constraints this morning, I'm running an older entry that I posted last year. Enjoy.....     To provoke and offend     Earlier this week, I had a profound experience in a convenience store. That statement is in itself enough to inspire an entire series of blogs (or therapy). I was trying to convince myself that I did not need junk food while standing in the middle of the candy aisle. As I considered my options and begged for restraint, in walked the poster child for the skinhead movement.  This young, white male was wearing only pants, hung low to expose his underwear and his shaven head reflected the fluorescent lighting. The no shirt and no shoes sign had apparently escaped his attention and he was obviously oblivious to the chilly temperatures outside. His body was covered in tattoos. I saw several swastikas, the words “white power”, assorted skulls and great many crosses. The crosses stood out amongst the profanity that had been permanently affixed under this man’s skin.  The tattoo that really reached out and grabbed me was in the small of the man’s back. It was a replica of a street sign. Its black letters stood out on the red background and an arrow pointed down toward the young man’s rear. The sign declared, “Exit only, no entrance!”  I stated earlier in the beginning of this process that I had a tendency to say and do stupid things. I should have put more thought into my response to the young man’s body art. I had just recently read in another blog that there is too much offending and provoking in the world. I was going to be guilty of provoking and probably offending. I didn’t have time to think, at least, that’s my excuse.  I pointed to the young man’s back and said, “cool ink.” His response did nothing to prevent my flippant conversation. He said loudly, “Hell yeah, f#*^k the queers!”  “You mean that’s an anti-gay tattoo?” I said pretending to be astounded.  “Yeah, you got a problem with it?” he said as he appeared to tense up his whole 120 pound frame.  I believe that people like this are almost harmless when outside of their respective hate groups. Alone, without the aide of his buddies or a truck full of diesel fuel and fertilizer, this young man was not intimidating. His legs were smaller than my arms and he appeared to be in poor physical condition. I stood over a foot taller, weighed over 130 pounds more that he, and had the backing of three more undercover officers in nearby aisles.  “Is that what that is?” I said, “I thought it was a reminder. I was just wondering if you were going to get one for your chin as well.”  I could see the rage building behind this man’s eyes. I also sensed fear. He could not react they way his group would have wanted. Part of me wanted him to react. I could only imagine this young man who appeared to hate everything and had the tattoos to prove it placed in a rural Alabama jail. A young, small white man with white power tattoos and large sign on his back that advised he would not be a willing participant in jail house sex. Attention in cellblock D, White Avenue is now open to two-way traffic.  Just as I reveled in my ability to raise this man’s ire, I felt a tinge of guilt, and embarrassment. I managed a half-hearted, “just kiddin’ with you man, chill out.” Then, I left the store empty handed.  I had promised to protect and serve. A promise is a promise and nowhere did that oath contain any amendments or exceptions. The same law that protects the many groups this young man swore to hate also protects him in his hatred. My personal beliefs and opinions held no bearing on that commitment. I was angry at my reaction and have reprimanded myself for my actions; however, I have to admit, it was just a little humorous.",

Not like you might think... oh yeah she came to all my concerts and helped me on my homework. She put on a great facade... she even fooled me for awhile. But no matter what I did I could never measure up to how great my sister was. See, my sister and mom had that great 'connection' that some parents have with their kids... I don't know, maybe i'm not capable of that, maybe it's my fault but I don't think i'll ever know. Even when my mom and sister did include me in those things I was still never really included.

As I sit here and think about this, maybe I wouldn't be so hurt if my mom truly knew what my sister was like. You see my sister was a great deceiver of all sorts. My mom thought she was little miss perfect... that she never did anything wrong. But I saw it all, I knew of everything she did but I never told... I always kept it to myself, afterall... it wasn't my place to tell. But if I ever did anything wrong, which compared to her deeds was nothing more than a simple slip up in the path of my life, but she would always tell and I would get in trouble. Still, I never told though. But because of this I slowly started to feel contempt for my sister, I tried hard to get along but we are so different. Everything I did in my sister's eyes was considered childish, immature, or stupid. She would always compare me to herself and how I should become more like her.

I'm sure they don't know it and probally could never truly understand what they mean to me. But I would just like to let them know that they are my world and without them I would be nothing. These people might not even be my best friend either... they are just people that give me an encouraging word when i'm feeling down.

The bigger news is I'm moving in with Colin as soon as she moves out!!!!  Man is she irritating though!  She moved in the middle of April and has caused so much drama I'm surprised that Colin hasn't lost his mind!  The first day she moved in she spilled beer all over the couch cushions and didn't clean it up, the couch just reeked of stale beer a couple of days later.  The next day she locked herself out of her room, she didn't have a key to the lock on it but she locked it behind her anyways and kept calling Colin to get him to open it for him, but he didn't have the key either.  In the end, she had to get one of the other roommates to force the door open, but didn't even have the decency to phone Colin and tell him that she was in, so we ended up coming home early from our night out for nothing!    Things went okay for another few days and we were thinking that maybe she was just a bit ditzy.  Unfortunately, she blew up a few days later.  Colin had some friends over working on Lee's car in the driveway until pretty late one Wednesday and she flipped because she said she couldn't get her 8 hours of sleep and absolutely HAD to call in sick to work because she was tired...boo-friggin-hoo.  She and Colin had a big discussion and determined that after 10:30pm on weeknights it would be quiet in the house.  This seemed to work out well for a week or so, but then Colin and I went away for the weekend for a surf trip and came back to another explosion.   While we were away, the smoke alarm needed batteries (how earth shattering) and the sink started leaking (heck these things happen, one day at the frat they were fixing the sink and just left us a hole with no faucet for 24 hours).  When she came home, Colin asked to speak with her about the new lock on her door.  He told her that as her landlord he needed a key and gave various reasons as to why.  She stated that if that were the case she would give her rent notice.  If that wasn't over the top, the next stuff she had to say was both insulting and insane.  She said that anyone going in to Colin's room would have access to the key and specifically said 'Cryssie could go into my room' um sorry I respect people's privacy and have never given her any reason to think that I would ever touch any of her things.  At this point, I was in the shower cleaning out the wetsuits, so I overheard everything, but she couldn't see me.  I was steamed over her accusation, but opted to talk to Colin and not her about it.    As I was finishing up with the wetsuits I noticed the time, it was about the time she usually got ready for bed so I decided that to be considerate I would leave some of the wetsuit stuff unfinished so that she could get ready for bed and I would finish up after she was done.  Well, she took one look at the mess (it wasn't that bad, just a bit of water on the floor and a Rubbermaid bucket by the toilet) and started slamming doors and kicking the Rubbermaid around.  I told Colin why I left the stuff out and he helped me clean up after she got out of the bathroom.  I also told him how insulted I was by her insinuating that I would go into someone else's things and said that I no longer felt welcome in his house and wanted to leave.  He asked me not to punish him for her actions and said that he would talk to her, so I decided to stay the night anyways.  She also accused him of not paying rent and using the roommates' money to go surfing with.  She actually went and talked to everyone in the house and asked him or her what he or she paid and complained about stuff to him or her.  Colin wasn't please and felt that she was trying to turn people against him for her benefit.  He assured her that he too pays rent and told her that he did not appreciate her running around talking about him behind his back.  Colin and Her Royal Highness did not talk for a couple of days, but when they did, it seemed that the chaos and fighting had finally ended for good.  She gave him a key to the room and apologized for dragging me into her rant about the lock.  While she didn't apologize to me directly, I was willing to move forward.  Colin went away for to Whistler this past Saturday and returned to find a note on his door informing him that she was moving out.  We assumed something had gone on over the weekend to piss her off, but neither of us was sad to hear that she was leaving.  It turns out that she had just found a place on her own that was cheap.  Apparently, she had always wanted a place to herself but had previously been unable to find one in her price range.  All seemed well, until yesterday morning.  I woke up around 7am to shower, but thought that she was in there, so I assumed she had chosen to shower earlier than her usual 7:20am time.  As I presumed she was done I got in the shower around 7:20am and was calmly rinsing my hair when this wild banging began on the bathroom door.  Since it was crazy banging and not a friendly please hurry I need in knock I chose not to respond verbally, instead I just hurried up and got ready to get out as fast as I could.  Colin, hearing this banging got up to see why someone was terrorizing me first thing in the morning.  She then started screaming at him to get me out of there because I don't pay rent and it was her shower time and she only had 15 minutes until she had to leave and so on.  I emerged from the bathroom as soon as I was sure I wouldn't run into her and went into Colin's room.  He looked at me and said, 'Don't say sorry, just say Surrey.'  We looked at the clock, my entire shower had taken under 5 minutes and she didn't even go into the bathroom for 10 minutes after I had vacated it!  I think she wanted to blame me for her not getting a shower....aigh!  I hid in Colin's room until I heard her go into the bathroom because I didn't feel like being screamed at.  Colin called me later on that day to make sure I was feeling okay and told me that he thinks she's psycho and is glad she is moving out.  Later that night when she came home, she tried guilt tripping him.  Her boyfriend broke up with her and then she went off on Colin that she thought that when she moved in they were going to be friends and that he would go surfing with her and blah blah blah.  What a dumbass, if you treat a guy's girlfriend badly why is he going to want to invite you anywhere?  Ah well when it all comes down to it I won, she treated me badly and he stuck up for me, so while the drama was unnecessary, all's well that ends with her moving out!  I haven't told my parents that I'm moving out.  I think it will go over like a ton of bricks tied to a herd of elephants, but I've been arguing with them for the past while and I think it is the right decision to move.  My mother threatened last week that she would throw my things out onto the lawn and took away the car for a week over my supposed offensive tone of voice!  Yikes, I'm only 23 going on 24 on the 31st!    Yesterday after all the drama, I saw Melissa.  We had a crazy driving filled day.  Our round trip was over 300km!  We went and played mini golf and arcade games at a theme park, ate dinner at a Chinese Buffet, shopped at Ikea, and played card games at her house.  It was tons of fun and I even got a hole-in-one on the 18th hole that won me a free game!    The weekend was pretty good too, on Friday I went to the Roxy with Nikki, Kim, and Michelle, it was somewhat dull at the club, but it was good to see Kim again!  On Saturday, it was the infamous Hose Reel festival (read giant friggin beer garden) and I finally went this year.  I met up with Allea, Wendy, Heidi, and Adrian and we drank, lay in the sun, and listened to live bands.  Afterwards Allea and I went back to Heidi and Adrian’s, chatted until 1am, and ate Greek food that we ordered in.  On Sunday, the very hung over boyfriend was back from Whistler.  We went for Thai and dessert with his friend Peter and his wife Evelyn.  It was nice to see them again and it was interesting to try my first Thai dishes.  Monday was great too!  Colin and I both had the day off so we slept in and then made a late breakfast with his downstairs roommate Bryan.  After that we ran errands, played pool and darts at the Legion, planted a garden, and I washed Colin's truck while he mowed the lawn.  After all that Heidi and Adrian came over and we had dinner and looked at my surfboard and some cute Colin and Cryssie surf trip photos!    To conclude this very long post I'll just say that I'm very happy right now and am optimistic about living with Colin!  listening to absolutely no music because I haven't bought new headphones yet",

(he was there for his girlfriend, but felt like talking to me!  whoa.)  i think everyone i know (me included) has  at least  a -tiny- little crush on him.  i'm pretty sure.  i guess what happened the other night doesn't mean anything.  he was just busy.  that's the only thing that has made me feel relatively good in the past few days.  well, and my friends' birthday parties yesterday",

I thought -- if I just wished hard enough and was good enough, I'd wake up on Christmas morning with snow outside my window and freckles across my nose! More than four centuries under western domination does that to you. I have sixteen cousins. In a couple of years, there will just be five of us left in the Philippines, the rest will have gone abroad in search of 'greener pastures.' It's not just an anomaly; it's a trend; the Filipino diaspora. Today, about eight million Filipinos are scattered around the world. There are those who disapprove of Filipinos who choose to leave. I used to. Maybe this is a natural reaction of someone who was left behind, smiling for family pictures that get emptier with each succeeding year. Desertion, I called it. My country is a land that has perpetually fought for the freedom to be itself. Our heroes offered their lives in the struggle against the Spanish, the Japanese, the Americans. To pack up and deny that identity is tantamount to spitting on that sacrifice. Or is it? I don't think so, not anymore. True, there is no denying this phenomenon, aided by the fact that what was once the other side of the world is now a twelve-hour plane ride away. But this is a borderless world, where no individual can claim to be purely from where he is now. My mother is of Chinese descent, my father is a quarter Spanish, and I call myself a pure Filipino-a hybrid of sorts resulting from a combination of cultures. Each square mile anywhere in the world is made up of people of different ethnic ties, with national identities and individual personalities. Because of this, each square mile is already a microcosm of the world. In as much as this blessed spot that is England is the world, so is my neighbourhood back home. Seen this way, the Filipino Diaspora, or any sort of dispersal of populations, is not as ominous as so many claim. It must be understood. I come from a Third World country, one that is still trying mightily to get back on its feet after many years of dictatorship. But we shall make it, given more time. Especially now, when we have thousands of eager young minds who graduate from college every year. They have skills. They need jobs. We cannot absorb them all. A borderless world presents a bigger opportunity, yet one that is not so much abandonment but an extension of identity. Even as we take, we give back. We are the 40,000 skilled nurses who support the UK's National Health Service. We are the quarter-of-a-million seafarers manning most of the world's commercial ships. We are your software engineers in Ireland, your construction workers in the Middle East, your doctors and caregivers in North America, and, your musical artists in West End. Nationalism isn't bound by time or place. People from other nations migrate to create new nations, yet still remain essentially who they are. British society is itself an example of a multi-cultural nation, a melting pot of races, religions, arts and cultures. We are, indeed, in a borderless world! Leaving sometimes isn't a matter of choice. It's coming back that is. The Hobbits of the shire travelled all over Middle-Earth, but they chose to come home, richer in every sense of the word. We call people like these balikbayans or the 'returnees' -- those who followed their dream, yet choose to return and share their mature talents and good fortune. In a few years, I may take advantage of whatever opportunities come my way. But I will come home. A borderless world doesn't preclude the idea of a home. I'm a Filipino, and I'll always be one. It isn't about just geography; it isn't about boundaries! It's about giving back to the country that shaped me. And that's going to be more important to me than seeing snow outside my windows on a bright Christmas morning. Mabuhay. and Thank you.",

I want to share my matured talents and experiences with my country, giving back to the place that shaped me.

        "blog_text": "Our actions are based on the seeking of results. We are engaged in a process of causation, trying to produce one thing through another. Such action is, in a sense, dishonest. We are doing one thing only to arrive at something else. The result is more important than our regard for what we are actually doing.  We seldom do anything for its own sake. Our action is not direct and present. It follows an ulterior motivation and a looking to the future. Our action works through time, which is the past and the future, and the denial of the present that is awareness.  Action that seeks a result, therefore, creates bondage to time. It attaches us to the stream of causation, in which we ourselves, becoming part of the process, can be moved, influenced and manipulated according to that which we seek. Matter, time, space and causation are ultimately the same. We see matter,- an inert or raw material to be used, according to our seeking of results.  To seek results is to create matter, to turn things into manipulatable objects. For example, if I desire to become a political leader, I must learn how to use the masses of people in order to give me power and influence. I must turn them into a tool and mould them like clay according to my ambition, which is exactly what most of our leaders attempt. In that seeking of results, I turn living human beings into mere instruments for arriving at what I want. Were I not seeking anything, I could look at people directly as human beings. When we see others as human beings, as ourselves, we cannot manipulate them. A future based upon the past - the past being our desire and the future its fulfilment - binds us to a mentality of absence and want. Turning the world (which is also our inner-most self) into an object alienates us and creates division in space. The seeking of results binds us to time, space and karma, not as some metaphysical theory but as a psychological fact. It creates our false world-idea based upon the ego, the work of sorrow and confusion or samsara that is the denial of our true self and being.  From the ego, which is the central focus of the ignorant, the original fissure in consciousness between self and other, comes our entire bondage to time, space and causation. Apart from the seeking of results, all life is spiritual, sacred or nirvanic - a pure and inviolable existence. Knowledge and ignorance are opposites - they are contrary to each other. Dwelling in the midst of ignorance, thinking themselves to be wise, the foolish totter like the blindfolded led by the blindfolded. The higher goal does not appeal to these heedless children, deluded by the material world, says the Katha Upanishad.  The Creator opened the gates of the senses to look without, not to see the inner Self.  Only a rare sage with his eye turned within, desiring immortality, sees the inner self. The childish follow after outer desires and enter into the noose extended by death. Once results cease to matter and ignorance is replaced by knowledge, the inner self becomes evident, and all bondage ceases. There is only a pure transformation, free of ego. Action is no longer predicated on the result; action becomes direct and present - it is no longer restrictive.",

        "blog_text": "I have another blog. Actually, I have a few. But sometimes I feel like I can't put everything that I am thinking because I don't want others to read it. So, I created this blog. I will put my more deep thoughts here and maybe I will share those thoughts with the other blogs but that is up to me. I have been reading this book called 'No Compromise: the Life Story of Keith Green' This book has made me think a lot. I think that it is perfect timing that I am reading it now. I am in Thailand. I have been here before and I felt like God told me I can come. I won't say that He called me here because I asked Him if I could come and He said yes. Or so I thought. I mean there has to be a reason I am here because I got time off of work and I had the money and got a scholarship from school to go. All the doors swung open in about a week's time. It was crazy! So I felt like there was a reason for me being here. \n\nI got here and there was nothing for me to do. The Thai people do everything. That is the way that it is supposed to be. I feel like I am doing nothing. That I am wasting my time here. That I could be at home pouring into my high school kids. I feel useless here. Then I pray because I know that there is a reason and I just don't know it.\n\nHere are my thoughts on why I am here. One, to be a listening ear. I get here and the day that I arrive Fai gets here. She was here when I was here last time and she moved to Mae Sot (in northern Thailand) to go to school and teach some classes. One night she was here we stayed up till way after one. She talked the whole time. She told me about the people who are in her classes. Some of them give her heart ache. She is discouraged by them. She was also telling me about the ministry that she is doing there. The people there want to play 'the world's song' as she says instead of God's song. They think that Christian music will turn away the people. She also told me of the way that God has been providing for them in the ministry. God is so good. She told me that she was glad that she came at the same time that I did and that she didn't miss me. This was the first time she came home since leaving. Then I talked to Jen who was here when I was last time and she moved back six months after we left. So she has been here for a year and a half. She told me about all the problems she is having with everyone. Problems with Kelly (the missionary here). She has a job at a public school and she lives on her own. They do not agree with what she is doing, I don't understand why, she feels like they think less of her. She calls him for encouragement and all he does is tear her down. Through this whole process she has lost her Hanai sister to the other guy who came at the same time as her. She said that she feels like she has no one to talk to.\n\nSecond, to get some rest. Liz and I went to the floating market and there was nothing to do there. We were in our hotel room talking for a good five hours or so. Not to mention all the rest I am getting here in Bangkok. Third reason I might be here is to be an encouragement to the Thai staff here. P Dton told me that he was so glad that I came to visit them. When he heard me say that he said that he almost cried. Then later he told me that they love it when I laugh. That it makes them smile or happy, or something. Those are the possibilities except for the last one, God is doing something that I cannot see.\n\nSo I am here feeling useless. I think that it has drawn me closer to God. Well at least made me more hungry for Him. I have been praying to be more hungry for Him. So this coupled with the Keith Green book is making some changes in my spirit. I have not come to the part in the story where he gets saved yet but his hunger for God is amazing to me. The book is written by his wife Melody. She says in the book that one thing about Keith was that he was always questioning her. Especially about who she is. I thought that was amazing. I want that. This book is showing me more of what I want in a husband. Someone who, when he is committed, is committed. She said that when God created him that He threw away the mold. I want someone who is one of a kind. He always was striving to find meaning in his life to find God. I want someone who will challenge me. To question me and expect the best that I can be. Someone who loves me. Someone who is always striving to get the most out of every moment. Someone who causes me to draw closer to God.\n\nYesterday in my devos I read 2 Peter. Verses 5-8 really touched me. 'For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.' I have been thinking about this a lot. I have always been proud of my faith. Not in a prideful way just confident. So the verse says to add to my faith goodness. Well I think that I am a pretty good person. Not perfect, can always be better. Then I am supposed to add to my goodness knowledge. Well I am going to Bible college. I will get more knowledge there and in doing my devos which I am trying to do better in. To my knowledge self-control. Sometimes I do good in this, other times I lose it and regret later, so definitely something to work on. To self-control perseverance. I think that I persevere pretty well but I think that I need more work there. Sometimes I just give up like in the boy department. Anyways to perseverance godliness. I am definitely not Godly. I really need to work on this. I need more patience (I guess this applies to self-control and perseverance together) more love, more kindness, more forgiveness, everything. To Godliness brotherly kindness. I am not very kind to some people and I feel bad sometimes. Even if I am nice to some people I don't think that not thinking nice about someone is brotherly kindness. Then the last one is love. If you look at 1 Corinthians 13, boy do I not have love. I need to remember these things and grow and be more like this. Because, 'if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.' I don't want to be unproductive and ineffective.",

If there is one thing I dislike about generic software jobs it is the attitude that  we only do software . I feel that this attitude fails to accept that software is part of a system, albeit often a crucial one. In my case, the system is an innovative scientific instrument. This is not a piece of software that exists purely in the binary innards of a computer. It reaches out and controls things in the real world: valves, relays, vacuum pumps, etc.  And I think of myself as a systems engineer; not just a programmer who uses a 'requirements gathering process' to work out what to do next and how to do it. I feel that my systems knowledge allows me to make informed decisions based on prior experience with other (often quite different) systems. My boss, however, does not want to that. I was told in a recent feedback session, 'we do software,  not  hardware'. I have a lot of experience writing software at the software-hardware boundary. It has given me a lot of insight into how hardware and software should be co-designed. I enjoy this. He finds this troubling. If I speculate, I think this is because he does not want the responsibility of a software-related hardware design decision going wrong.  So what do I now? How do I keep doing what I feel I am good at if I constantly get feedback, in all its implicit and explicit forms, that says  'we don't like that, please stop doing it' ? Is this another reason for dusting off the CV and looking around?  Or am I just getting overly sensitive to my environment?

Today Neshee explained that she thought I wasn't like most Americans she knew. It is the third time I have heard such a comment since I have been over-seas. While it is meant as a compliment, I can't help but notice how such a negative attitude of America has permeated the world's consciousness. Some of this is well deserved I suppose, for there is no country or peoples that escape sin and selfishness. However, I still remain perplexed at the biggoted attitude towards Americans. I often wonder, haven't you ever witnessed a bad person or a bad deed done by someone other than American. It makes me confused how in this day and age, people can still group a whole population togther as if they have a common thought process or way of actions.

        "blog_text": "Hey Everyone, This is an email I received today, thought it was interesting. End the Homosexual Genetics Debate by Wendy Lawrence. Liberals like to complain about a lot of things. Especially liberals here at Swarthmore. But I don't think it is just an inherent desire to whine, I think there's a lot of stuff that's just plain wrong. I'm going to talk about something today that I think is just plain wrong. In a nutshell, I want to discuss why straight people make me mad. Not all of them, of course - my boyfriend's straight and that makes me happy - but a lot of them. Specifically, those who think it is their God-given right to think of homosexuals as less moral, less religious, less qualified, or my personal favorite, less 'natural.' Even more specifically, I hate the way they have tried to frame the issues surrounding the homosexual rights movement. I find the argument 'it might be genetic' fairly insulting. By itself, it certainly is an interesting question, as I think almost any question about inheritable traits is. But outside of a scientific inquiry, the question of inheritable traits could lead to an answer with serious political and moral consequences. Standing firmly behind the idea that genetic issues do not belong in the political or moral realm, I would go so far as to say that no good at all can come from the current murmurs of 'is it genetic?' The most obvious evidence of this comes directly from those who ask the question, the ways in which it is asked and the connotations it carries. Rarely is a group of people sitting around discussing the latest advances in genetics, wondering if our personalities, our emotions our sexual orientation are genetically inheritable. More likely, it is an excuse. 'Well maybe it's in their genes.' As if they really meant 'Maybe it isn't their fault.' And this is where I have a big problem. Because the issue of fault should never be considered. Fault, by definition, implies bad. I would agree that these questions are probably asked by some of the more liberal of the straight population, those at least willing to lend an ear to the issue. And they are even asked by members of the homosexual population. The problem comes when this assumption begins to frame the political movement, as I fear it has. I love my boyfriend. I'll call him 'Jay' for the rest of this article, because well, that's his name. So here I am, loving Jay, and I don't have to be ashamed to say that in a published newsletter. I don't have to be afraid to be seen with him in public. I doubt that there is a 'Jay' gene somewhere in the double helix of nucleotides that makes me who I am. And yet, this should come as a shock to those who ask the genetic question about homosexuals, I'm still allowed to go out with him. Fascinating isn't it, what a liberal world we inhabit? Some of us, that is....The homosexual movement will go nowhere arguing 'it's not their fault, it's genetic.' An author in the latest issue of Common Sense makes this clear by arguing that our freedom to choose to get an abortion combined with our knowledge of genetics might someday lead people to abort homosexual children. A fine argument, but a misguided conclusion. That isn't an anti-abortion argument, it's an argument in favor of the acceptance of homosexuals. In a world where homosexuals were accepted, this wouldn't be an issue; the baby would be the child of proud parents. Going on the assumption that aborting children because they are homosexual is not a good thing, a reader of that article must conclude that homosexuals must be accepted in our society. We cannot accept a society that accepts homosexuals simply because it is 'not their fault' - regardless of whether a gene is found or not. Not only does this belief have horrid implications for a world with increasing capabilities of genetic engineering, but it has severe consequences in terms of the ways in which these people are treated in everyday society. Can you imagine if the African-American rights movement of the 1960's had phrased its ideology in the terms 'it's not their fault, it's genetic'? The stalled progress, the misunderstandings, and the misguided attempts to ameliorate racism would have set race relations back twenty years. Maybe I'm afraid. Afraid of a world where, in order to be Jay's girlfriend I'd have to (a) sequence my DNA for the elusive 'Jay' gene, or (b) give up my job, friends, and life. One option sounds impossible, the other ridiculous. And vice-versa. If you think the above situation sounds ridiculous, you are right. But it's happening. The fact that it wouldn't happen to me does not mean I am morally good, religious, or have particularly superior DNA. It means I'm lucky. Lucky to be accepted in a society that likes to pick on random groups of people that it deems worth picking on. From a moral standpoint, I don't intend to use my luck to the advantage of others. From a selfish standpoint, I don't want to set a precedent for Uncle Sam in the bedroom. He seems to get enough of this as it is.",

        "blog_text": "On the reading of two books:  I am currently in the middle of two very different books.  One is called “Jude the Obscure” by Thomas Hardy.  It was written in 1895 and follows a poor man who’s dreams of going to university are not realized, ends up marrying a woman because she pretends to be pregnant, falls in love with his unhappily married cousin and between them (he and his cousin) they bear children and are despised by the people around them.  It is, in part, an exploration of the depths to which a person can descend and the prejudices that abound.  The other book I am reading is “Saint Francis of Assisi” written by G.K. Chesterton.  It is Chesterton’s writings about a man who was intensely in love with Christ.  Saint Francis took God seriously and as a result did not take himself seriously.  He did many things that the people around him did not understand with the purpose of bringing God’s children back to Himself.  One book explores depths and the other explores heights.  (As a side, I think it is ironic that the “higher” book is about a man who was incredibly humble and intent on lowering himself before God and man while the “lower” book is about a man who intended to raise himself to another social stature and ended up drowning in mire.)  The first book by Hardy impresses upon me the despair that a person can bring upon himself through his fallen nature.  The second book is not only uplifting but encourages me to imagine what my life would look like if I truly loved Jesus like He calls us to love Him.    I must ask myself what is the best expenditure of the time I have been given.  For while the depths can be informative, I find myself concerned about what encourages me to produce fruit and develop character.  As a mother of a little one, I want him to see me seeking to know God in all that I do.  Do not misunderstand me; I do not want to be isolated from the pain that exists.  I refer again to St. Francis who lived in the midst of the pain of a leper colony in abject poverty.  I want to see this pain the way God sees it; knowing that He would not have it this way and he has left His servants here to bind the wounds with Christ’s grave cloths so that He can work His miracle of healing.     Some would say that you must know of that pain before you can heal it and that is why we need to know works like Hardy’s.  I don’t disagree and that is why I haven’t quit the reading of “Jude,” but when I think about what to make the primary focus of my reading I want it to be “whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable” and all things excellent and praiseworthy.",

        "blog_text": "What Gay Marriages Threaten \nI couldn't believe this was on google news.  It looks like a cheap site to begin with, so I don't know how this constitutes news.  What the article is trying to do is prove that gay marriage is indeed a threat to society and that it has negative implications.  Now, what the article actually does is prove that only half of the website's name seems to be true.  Yes, the first half of it in case you were wondering.  Now I'm gonna rip this piece of shit article apart and see what happens.     \nI’ve seen two separate TV interviews with newly “married” gay people. Both interviews ended with one of the “spouses” plaintively asking, “What is it about gay marriage that threatens anyone?” That’s a 'When did you stop beating your wife?' question. It hides two questions in one, making it impossible to answer the first differently than the second. Marriage is about the “relationship” between the partners, but it’s also about “family.” Whereas I’m utterly indifferent to their relationship with each other, I oppose what gay marriage implies about family.     \nApparently 'What is it about gay marriage that threatens anyone?' has two questions hidden in one.  However, the author doesn't say what those two questions are.  If this is indeed a set up for an argument, it's done badly.    And to compare it to 'When did you stop beating your wife?' is not only ridiculous and unfounded, especially since no argument is set up, but I can replace that same question with 'When did straight people start fucking their children?'  Who knows, and what's that have to do with anything?  Besides, if we're really asking 'When did you stop beating your wife?' That's a cut and dry answer.  Usually it's, 'I never stopped.'  OR 'I stopped a (Blah Amount of Time) Ago.'    Now, for the author, can you answer 'What is it about gay marriage that threatens anyone?'  Let's see...   \nNot every marriage produces children, but of those that do, the marriage is the foundation for being both spouse and parent. Therefore, what you rule about marriage has deep and lasting repercussions for what it means to be a parent. The Massachusetts Supreme Court's decision about gay marriage simply fails to understand this. Their argument presumes that marriage is solely about the relationship between the spouses. To this court, marriage is one-dimensional. They see no relevant contrast between same-sex spouses and heterosexual spouses, which is true. Since they only recognize the spousal dimension of marriage, they hastily conclude that the marriage as a whole cannot possibly be different. We're not sure whether the court's blinkered vision is intentional or merely shallowness revealed, but the effect is the same.   \nI don't see any point whatsoever in this part of the article.  Gay people can adopt, and, if their marriage is indeed FINALLY legal, then BOTH are parents.  And they would have to take care of the child as parents would under the law.  There are no special gay parenting omissions.  Besides, what gay people have been fighting for is marriage equal to those of straight people.  Regardless of the procreation aspect, we'd be equal to say straight couples who can't have children biologically due to physical problems.  Are they not indeed a true family either?   \nTo oppose gay marriage is not to denigrate the relationship between the spouses. It is, however, to stand firmly behind traditional ideas about family.    \nAh, there's the actual point the author's trying to make: Traditional ideas about family.  Why didn't you say that from the beginning?    To comment on tradition, interracial marriages weren't traditional either.  Care to tackle that one?   \nLet's start with the obvious. Society has always placed child-rearing responsibility with the biological parents. If you beget a child, then you're responsible for it, whether you like it or not. We don't care if it's difficult or inconvenient. You beget it, you be raisin' it. The biological parents acquire responsibility merely because they procreated. That's how it always has been, for many good reasons.   \nFirst of all, both parents don't have to be married to be responsible for the child.  A child's father, whether he married the woman or not, has responsibility over that child.  A woman can indeed chase a man, who ran off, down and ask him for child support.  Second of all, if you adopt a child, you are taking on the exact same responsibilities as a parent.  Once you sign those adoption papers, it's as if you are begetting a child.  Third of all, begetting a child has never been and never will be a requirement between any two couples who marry, whether gay, straight, married or interracial.    So, no, that's not how it's always been.   \nGay marriage denies this. Since children don't come from same-sex unions, for gay couples to enjoy equal status as parents, you have to abandon the traditional link between begetting and raising the child. You have to say that it isn't necessary for the biological parent to be responsible for raising the child. If so, on whom does the responsibility fall? The inevitable result is that raising the child becomes voluntary.    \nGay marriage hasn't denied anything.  There is still adoption, there is still artificial insemination and there are still amazing biological breakthroughs where two eggs can create a child now.  Begetting a child has never been a requirment between any two couples.  And, yes, in many cases getting the child would be voluntary, adoption.  Once you adopt, you can't just keep the receipt and give it back if you're not happy within the first 30 days, you fucking retard.   \nIs anyone comfortable with the idea that parenting is voluntary? It doesn't matter whether two gays would provide admirable love and affection for the child. It doesn't matter that plenty of heterosexual parents fail in their responsibilities. When you assert that two gays have the same status as biological parents, you can no longer insist that biological parents be responsible for the child merely because of their intercourse.    \nThis author is all over the board here.  I can't even make sense of this article anymore.  Anyway, I'll try.    \nI and millions of others are perfectly comfortable with adopting if that's what you mean by voluntary.  If you mean that gay marriage is trying to make parenting voluntary in general. as in you think that gay people can just give away their child at will once they get bored, then I'd like to see where you read that because, last I checked, equal marriage rights means two gay parents would have to take care of a child like any other type of parents.  And, so far, it's impossible to have two gay parents to have the same status as biological parents since no one has figured out how to combine two sperms to make a baby, only ova.  If you're saying they have the same BIOLOGICAL status then I see what you might be saying.  You're talking about genders and gender roles.  But, since when was it a requirment for mom to stay at home and dad to work?  I think those traditional values were attacked long ago by women looking for equal rights as well.  I wanna see what you have to say about that subject.    \nBesides, no one said that once a gay couple marries they can just have a child and leave it in a dumpster if they feel bored with it.  I don't see where your fears are coming from.  And did you say that, 'It doesn't matter whether two gays would provide admirable love and affection for the child.'?  Oh, ya, you did.  Does a child not need love and affection?  And you're forgetting that, as the kid's new found parents, they'd also provide food and shelter for the child as well.  But maybe there's more than provisions and love when it comes to raising a child.  But you still haven't said what that is.  And, yes, it DOES matter if ANY couple with children fails in their responsibilities you half wit.  It seems like YOU don't care much about children.  I should write an article on why you shouldn't get married.   \nLet’s not kid each other. We all know what would happen. If we make parenting a voluntary choice, the moment the baby becomes inconvenient (i.e., within minutes), it gives cause to break the contract. The whole concept of parental responsibility becomes a merely admirable goal. The, since we don't use government to enforce virtue, we keep government away from enforcing parental responsibility. We can hear it now – “How dare the government tell me who to care for!” The Supreme Court will rule that if the right of privacy means anything, surely it means that individuals are free to love and care for others at their own choice. Meanwhile, the baby needs a change and a feeding.   \nWOAH!  Again, as legal parents under the law, they HAVE to take care of the child.  And like ANY OTHER STRAIGHT COUPLE WHO GOT 'BORED', SHALL WE SAY, THEY PUT THEIR KID UP FOR ADOPTION!  You're assuming that because there is no procreation involved, then the parents don't feel as close to the kid as parents who did procreate.  That is absolutely not the case.  Why are kids then put up for adoption if these straight parents had such an attachment?  Do they all come from parents who just couldn't afford them?  Gay parents will make mistakes like the BILLIONS of straight parents before them.  Does that make the mistakes forgivable?  Well, you did say, 'It doesn't matter that plenty of heterosexual parents fail in their responsibilities.'  So, maybe mistakes don't matter to you.  They matter to me, but the mistakes won't be any more or less severe because of the sexuality of the parents.  They are more or less severe depending on the mistake that was made.     \nAnd you're forgetting artificial insemination.  Then the kid is indeed from at least one of the parents.  And, with new breakthroughs, they are even able to combine to sperm to put into one egg.  And hence, the baby is both parents'.  These breakthroughs in science are obviously not perfected, but there've been tons of scientific journals on the subject, and I suggest you read up on them.  Here's a link to the men being able to make eggs:  and here's a link to two ova becoming a baby: .  Yes, they're all tests on rats, but that's where all tests start.  And fuck you for thinking that a gay couple won't change and feed a baby because they wanted to go fuck each other.  Who do you think you are making these assumptions?   \nThere is another option. We might legally separate family from marriage, so that being a parent has nothing to do with being a spouse. Marriage becomes one thing, family another. You can raise children in or outside marriage, so much that marriage is irrelevant to the matter. The biological parents don't have to live together, or like each other, or ever see each other. A child becomes merely a legal liability shared by two individuals, allowing each individual to pursue whatever spousal relationship they like, regardless of whether it includes the biological partner or not. Children become tax-deductible dependants, but nothing more. Children become the shared property of two legally liable individuals, but there is no presumption that the children belong to any stable social unit under the same roof. The relationship is legally amorphous, and can take any form. Of course, this disembowels any notion of family in the traditional sense, but that's the price.   \nOk, this situation has already happened and IS happening between millions of married straight couples.  Just because you marry doesn't mean you have a family, and just because you have a family doesn't mean you're married.  They were never a one and the other situation.  This deals with ethics and morals and opinion.  I agree that if someone were to get married and have kids, they should provide a stable, loving situation.  To assume that gay people wouldn't do that is obviously a biased and uninformed opinion you've made based on stereotypes and hatreds.    \nBut don't be so quick to put every negative thing you mentioned above about family and children on the homosexual.  Indeed, these negative aspects must've been ways paved long before this time since no homosexuals were ever able to marry, hence, the straight couple created these negative aspects to marriage and family.  To have a gay couple act as you have described here, would only be to mimic a certain type of straight couple.    \nLet's not pretend that all gay marriages will be happy and perfect just as we shouldn't pretend that straight people know exactly how to get married and be happy with a great, stable family.  There will always be bad marriages and there will always be broken families.  But gay people deserve the right to try.   \nYou can entertain gay marriage only if you abandon either the spousal or the parental dimensions of marriage. You can have gay marriage with the spousal dimension alone. You can have gay marriage with the parental dimension alone. However, you can't have gay marriage and simultaneously hold both traditional dimensions of marriage.   \nYes, you can.  You haven't done a thing to prove otherwise this whole article.  You still haven't even introduced the two questions hidden in the first question you stated saying, 'What is it about gay marriage that threatens anyone?'   Those who support gay marriage portray opponents as bigoted bullies. They challenge us to show how gay people's love and devotion are any less valid than heterosexuals are. That's one-half of the 'when did you stop beating your wife' question. Of course, no one can reasonably deny that gays love and commit as deeply as straights. At that point, gay marriage supporters throw up their hands in exasperation. Then how could one oppose gay marriage? The answer is that there's more to marriage than being a spouse.    \nNo gay person said that there isn't more to marriage than being a spouse.  And since when did conservatives get so sensitive?   \nThen the other half of the 'when did you stop beating your wife' question enters: Not every marriage needs children, does it? No, but for those families that do bear children, the role of marriage is critical. Supporters of gay marriage, like the Massachusetts court, have to specifically ignore this to make their argument. To soothe the feelings of childless couples, supporters of gay marriage have to offend the feelings of the vast majority of childbearing parents.    \nLOL!  What the fuck does this have to do with beating one's wife!?  HAHAHAHAHA!  I think that is SO funny!  But apparently the other question has FINALLY entered.  I have seen NO ONE say that a gay couple doesn't want kids and to raise them as a straight couple would.  I've actually ONLY seen that is what gay couples actually WANT!  In courts, there have been dozens of testimonies from gay parents who wanted to have marriage legalized to SHOW THEIR KIDS THAT THEY ARE A TRUE FAMILY!  Which is what this article is trying to pretend is not the case.  The gay people who want to get married want the whole package.  A loving marriage, and a stable family.  I don't know WHY this is offensive to the vast majority of childbearing parents.   \nI'll speak for myself. I have no desire to prevent domestic partners from visiting hospital bedsides. I oppose all of the abuses gay partners have to endure for being partners. No landlord should bar gay partners from renting an apartment. I frankly don't see why gays can't designate their partners as dependants or beneficiaries. I hate to admit it, but I care about the gay lifestyle as much as I care about turtles' sex lives: I'm utterly uninterested in it. I figure it's none of my business, and I couldn't possibly care less. Nevertheless, I'm a married man, and a father of four children. Please don't ask me to abandon what my marriage and family means, just to pacify gays who feel disgruntled by the traditions that have carried society through thousands of years.    \nThese traditions haven't carried us anywhere.  I can easily say that the tradition to say bless you after a sneeze has carried society through thousands of years.  I'm glad you're finally speaking for yourself because I thought that's what the rest of the article was doing, but I haven't read a single argument in this whole article.  Traditions have changed through the years.  If you've seen Fiddler on the Roof, you'd know.  Interracial marriage wasn't traditional, women working wasn't traditional, women in the army wasn't traditional, women playing sports wasn't traditional, men staying at home to raise a kid wasn't traditional.  Why aren't those the traditions that have threatened society?  Well, because you just don't think so.  But you just think gays shouldn't marry because you really don't seem to like the idea for some reason.  You try to make it seem you have nothing against gays in your last paragraph, and maybe you don't.  But, if I were to say you shouldn't get married because you're straight, but I happened to like a lot of straight people anyway, I'm sure you'd think that I had maybe an INKLING of dislike for straight people.    \nAnyway, just because you dislike gay people on even a miniscule level doesn't mean you have to take rights away from us.  And just because we are getting married doesn't mean we're destroying anything of yours either.  Get over yourself and take care of your family for god's sake.  No gay person gives a shit about your family, they want to give a shit about their own.  Let them.",

        "blog_text": "In a conversation Sunday evening, Barry and I got talking about our desire to live WITH the poor.  We both voiced some frustration with the difficulty of applying our so-called theology.  I came across this passage from one of my favorite Regent professors, Charles Ringma, and I thought it complimented our conversation nicely:     The majority of those of us who live in the First World are relatively well off.  Yet there is a spiritual poverty in the First World.  Whether this is directly related to our materialism is an open question.  It may also be related to the way our whole life is ordered, made secure, and made predictable (cf. my previous blog).  More deeply, it may be linked to the gap we have created between what we believe and the way we live.  Having turned a deaf ear to the cry of the poor in our own world and having abandoned a discipleship that calls us away from our own concerns, we may well have lost touch with the God who champions the cause of the poor.  Therefore it is we, rather than the people of the developing world, who need to recover the vision splendid.  Nouwen makes a similar observation: 'I discovered that the victims of poverty and oppression were often more deeply convinced of God's love than we are.'  Possibly one way forward for those of us in the First World who long to rediscover a vibrant and relevant spirituality is to join with the poor, not as helpers, but as partners.  In this way we may also draw close to the heart of God.   Ringma leaves us with James 2.5:   Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?    These words resonate deeply within my soul.  My friend Joyce, the woman who oversees Jacob's Well (the incarnational ministry that I've told both of you about), puts it another way: like Jesus, we are not to be friends TO the poor; rather, we are to be friends OF the poor.  Initially, this thought is humbling to me--to realize that the poor have just as much or maybe more to offer me than I do them.  But the more I reflect on this concept, the more my pride and arrogance is whittled away and I begin to recognize that I don't really have that much to offer them.  This is, perhaps, why white upper-middle-class suburban kids like us are so scared to befriend the poor: we are worried that they can see right through us.  Perhaps this scares us because we are quite content with our false views of self and identity.  Reflecting on this theme encourages me to move away from my illusions concerning self and move toward vulnerability and community.  This movement that I speak of is not foreign to the three of us.  In fact, all three of us have accompanied one another on this journey.  I have the two of you to thank for most of my growth over the last three years.  You have allowed me to take off the masks that I often wore and provided me with a place where I feel known.  Thank you for that, and I pray that we will continue to bless one another in this way for our lifetimes.  For your reading pleasure, I leave you with the link to the Jacob's Well website.

But that's good, because I love to read, and I love to read messages from far away ... it is almost a substitute for travelling, to receive a message from a distant place and to imagine the place it came from. It reminds me that the world is bigger than the walls of PAI, bigger than the city limits of London, bigger than the coasts of the UK ...  It sounds like terrible times at the airport! I really hate that, that certain moment when you realise that the adventure has come to an end and you have to return to the boring reality of your everyday life. It is no surprise that many people choose to travel all the time, never returning home but always moving somewhere new.   I'm pleased that the homeless guy called you - it showed you that you had a really positive influence on a new person while here in London. Make that two people, because you had a really positive influence on me as well. I don't know what to think about Friday and Saturday, and I am trying not to think too much about it and to destroy the memory by attempting to give it too much definition or analysis. I have to be artistic and not scientific in this instance! Like you say, what will be, will be, and what has been, has been. I have no regrets, as long as you have no regrets either. It is good to travel through life collecting experiences, and to establish connections with people, of whatever type. I once remember Thom Yorke from Radiohead saying something similar in an interview: that 'the purpose of life is to meet and make connections with people. Because there's nothing else to do'. I think it's a good philosophy; or at least it's a better philosophy than any I could invent!   I don't know if I have found a friend, or something more, or something else, or whatever, but all I know is that I have found a Rini, and the word Rini has more symbolism than any other descriptive term. So, grunge girl, I just got your sms about new year - it seems that you will be very busy then as well. I guess I will plan my trip to Indonesia for next year, and for now I will have to content myself with daydreaming. I am very good at daydreaming, so hopefully I will be contented enough.  Have fun in Makassar with your family ... and it seems as though they confused you with Tanto in suspecting that Club X was a strip-club! That terrible London, destroying the innocence of so many young Indonesians! I hope you enjoyed the band, and it was great to hear the first diary entry of Rini. I look forward to the next entry. Until then: keep smiling, and laughing, and singing, and saying 'MY GODD'!   I miss you a lot. Who else do I have to visit the underground vaults with?????  Matt-lah.   Asmayani Kusrini, DONG! How are you? I've been getting your sms messages all day, and trying hard to reply but still, STILL, my damned phone network is not sending them. To make things worse, the stupid PAI office still has no internet access so I have been searching for an internet cafe ... sometimes it seems as though the entire concentration of the world is spent upon ruining my attempts at communication: no phone, no internet, all the internet cafes are full up ... any second now a freak earthquake will cause this PC to fall to the ground and even this unfinished message will be lost. Let's hope not ....  Putra spoke to me about his girlfriend and yes, she has got chicken pox, and you are quite correct in saying that it is a 'pustular skin eruption' but, MY GOD, Rini, what a way to describe it! A pustular skin eruption - it leaves nothing to the imagination whatsoever! No wonder you are a journalist - maybe you should consider a career as a horror novelist! And for someone who doesn't even like cemeteries either ... my god ...  I am still disgusted that Poppy and Damai became obsessed with that guy (he's from Ukraine, by the way). And they are two old women, married, with children, who should know better! I am glad to hear that you did not share in their crush, otherwise I would think that the whole world is going crazy. You know, he and I don't really like each other very much ...   I received your sms with the words from 'Black' by Pearl Jam in it ... I tried to send you some song lyrics in reply, but my annoying phone again refused to send them. My first thought was to send you some words from Fake Plastic Trees by Radiohead ... 'she wears me out .... she weeeearrrrrrrrs me out' (although of course I had to add that you wear me out in a good way). And then I thought that maybe, in answer to your lyrics (which seemed a little despairing) I could send 'hey you, don't let me down, take a sad song ... and make it bettterrrrrrr' by of course the Beatles. I remember that night in the bar in Scotland with you, Poppy and Putra, with the three of you singing along as loud as you could to that song which was being covered by that young guy. It still makes me smile ;-)  Hey and guess what else? I no longer have to be jealous of your video tapes, because today I found the tape of all the interviews so I can watch them to remind myself of you and of everyone else! Maybe we could arrange a swap - I'll copy you that tape, if you copy me yours ...  Your secret cape sounds really nice, and it's terrible that civilization has invaded it. Everyone needs somewhere quiet and unspoiled, even if it is only inside their head. Maybe you can invent a mental cape that you can escape to, although it's never as satisfying as going to the real thing. A mental cape where you can meet Kurt Cobain, Ed Vedder and the rest of your heroes, and sit around strumming guitars with them, watching the sunset, talking about life and everything else, a place that GATRA doesn't have the number for so that they can never track you down, a place where you can catch fish that will already be hot and spiced so that you can eat them immediately after you've caught them.  And now you are taking a cookery course? My God, you are so active ... you work so much, you belong to so many organisations, and now you are taking classes as well. It makes me embarrassed that I am so lazy. But I am very enthusiastic and encouraging of your cooking course ... because when I come to visit you can cook me lots of wonderful things, lah? I don't mean to be sexist, because of course I wouldn't really expect you to cook for me (it's a good thing this email is not being sent to Damai) but already I am looking forward to the taste of Indonesian food. I might take my brother to Bali Bali one day, I think he'd like it. Incidentally, my brother has brought back all the CDs I requested, so I can make you a really good tape. Prepare to hear some amazing music, Rini, and I won't even be singing it myself!   Well, I think I have written almost as much as you have. My friends always say 'my GOD Matt, you write so much!' but I think in you I have met someone who beats me. Which is a good thing, because I don't feel so guilty about making someone read all my crazy thoughts and impressions.  Have a big hug from me, mi querida Rini, and I will write some more soon.  Remember to practise your Slovak language every day: ZMRZLINA!   Matthew.  PS - you know I now have 3 Indonesian-English dictionaries??? Nurcholis gave me 2, and Runi gave me 1, so I guess I have no excuse for not learning Indonesian, hey?   SALING BERCIUM!   My GODD ... I didn't know that 'bajingan' was such a bad word, I'm sorry ... I searched for 'devil' in the dictionary, and I found the idiomatic phrase 'little devil', which in English is a 'cute' phrase that means something like 'naughty'. I'm glad you didn't take offence, anyway, and I'll certainly make sure I don't say it to any strange Indonesians! I don't want them to break my nose, and even though (I think) I am very tall compared to many Indonesian people, they might know some kind of kung-fu or tae-kwon-do or Thai kickboxing that I would have no defence against! You know, it's always been an ambition of mine to learn karate, or kung-fu or something like that, just in case I was ever attacked by an angry Indonesian or any other angry people. London can be a dangerous place (Runi can confirm that), especially in some parts, such as the part I was born in. Can you believe that somebody I once knew at school is now in prison for committing armed robbery? And that som eone else from my school was killed in a knife fight outside a McDonald's restaurant? Maybe that's why I never had a 'gang' at school, because the gangs were always fighting each other, and fighting other gangs at other schools, and so on ... it's probably very tame compared to Indonesian schools.   Hey that's a coincidence, because I was going to send an email to Runi to say thank-you for leaving me the dictionary, and as a joke I was going to say that when her new baby is born, if it's a boy, she might like to name it Matthew. But now I can't make that joke, because she will be sure that I have been speaking to you or to someone else that knew about her stomach-touching aura activities! It's very complimentary, if Runi wanted her baby to be like me, although as a 23 year-old man it is a little disturbing that women see me as having all the desirable qualities for a baby, rather than having all the desirable qualities for a man. Still I should stop complaining: a compliment is a compliment, right? Better to be a baby than a dog, or a politician ...  As for getting angry, sure I get angry, just like everybody else, but maybe the difference is that I find the whole idea of anger a very funny one. Especially for someone like me, a 'decadent westerner' who has never really known any pain or hardship in their life, at least not pain in the sense of torture, revolution, oppression, starvation, earthquakes. Whenever I get angry, I get into a rage for a second or two, my face turns red like a tomato and my eyebrows lower, I growl like a devil, and then a second later I start laughing because I realise how funny it is that I am getting so annoyed because of whatever the issue is. It's the same when other people get angry: they start shouting, and growling, and their face turns red and their veins start to pop out from their necks, but instead of being scared or concerned I always begin to laugh. But then again, there is always something guaranteed to make me angry, and it's too difficult to laugh about ... MARGARET THATCHER. My GODDDD, that woman makes me really ANGRY! I don't even want to start thinking about her.  I hope you enjoyed your cream hair-bath (in English, that phrase sounds a little strange ... like something Tanto would have experienced when he went to Soho: my god, that guy still makes me laugh even now). It's a shame that people still describe you as the ex-girlfriend of the guy who took an overdose ... I suppose it's a very common thing, to describe someone as 'the friend of x' or 'the girlfriend of y' - we are always being defined in terms of someone else, and for you it's just unfortunate that you are associated with such a sad situation. My advice is to do something amazing, become a celebrity, make a grunge album, fly to Mars, so that the legend of Rini becomes more famous than the story of your ex-boyfriend. I will start spreading your legend here in London by telling everyone I know about your adventures ... catching SARS in Singapore, going to Aceh, meeting PADI, writing 30,000 words in four hours, having a house full of servants ... ;-)  Talking of words, if you need any help with your article on Marx, just ask me. I know a little bit ... I studied Marx for a while at university, and I wrote an essay on his influence in British literature. I could probably also suggest a few articles for you to read, and find a few books that might have a whole chapter on Marx and England that you can copy-lah!  Okay I'd better go - tonight I am going out with my brother, I don't know where yet, maybe just get some food, and have some drinks. Try and get some sleep tonight, so you don't wake up surrounded by lots of screaming girls! For a man that would be like waking up in paradise, but for you I'm sure it's like waking up from a dream into a nightmare!   Take care little devil - not a demon, like Frans Padak!   Sayanara  Matthew Bloomsbury   Christ on a bike. So Runi called me a 'chubby baby'? Damn, that's another insult to add to my list. Chubby is a very cruel word in English ... it means (as I'm sure you know) to have a fat face. Well I was just about to buy myself a meat sandwich for dinner (because I haven't eaten anything yet today) but I guess I will go hungry, to try and escape the chubbiness :-(  I have just attempted to go shopping - GOD, I hate shopping. I bought a shirt, coincidentally I was trying on a black one but it didn't fit properly. I'm glad you like the black shirt though; it's my favourite as well. I will wear it every day in Italy - or perhaps I will buy five more and wear a different one each day!   But all these complaints are insignificant compared to what you are telling me about Aceh and the missing journalists. My God, I hope you are not sent to Aceh, because I would be worried - and if you were kidnapped, then I would be forced to try and rescue you, and of course I would be unsuccessful and get kidnapped as well and we would both be locked in a cell, given only bread and rats to eat. And one of your friends died in your arms as well ... Rini, you are so young, but you've had all these deaths to deal with already - it makes me realise how lucky I am to live in the UK.  When do you return to Jakarta? Is it this weekend? Back to your little room, and your desk, and the smoke and the traffic? Do you plan to meet with any other participants, or will there not be enough time? I hope your boss gives you something interesting to write about ... maybe he will ask you to write about your experiences in London, the Parliament, the BBC etc. Unless he wants to restrict your London stories to just Harry Potter!  I have to go now and continue searching for hotels in Italy. I am so lazy - I simply want to go home, eat, sleep and never think again about work, holidays, the world, anything. Maybe I should learn to meditate, to clear my mind of everything so that no thoughts can disturb me or annoy me. Matthew Bloomsbury Buddha!  Okay take care grunge girl  Matthew.   Purple light! My GOD, it's already been a week (almost) since you left the UK! It currently feels as though I am simply taking a break from all the Indonesians, and that next week you will all be back again, just as normal, going on visits in coaches, and I'll be running up and down from the office to the hotel all the time. But no ... you are in Makassar, and will be in Jakarta tomorrow, and next week I will be in Rimini - international friends-lah! Rini-Dong! Rini, rini. My GODDDD ...  My phone has just quit on me: there's no power left in the battery. It's not surprising as I have been calling Italian hotels all afternoon. When I get home I'll recharge it, and send you loads of sms messages. Tonight is a lazy night ... I am watching a movie with my brother, and eating junk food - sometimes it's the nicest thing, to just sit around and watch a crappy Hollywood movie. It's a waste of time, sure, but often it is a privilege to have enough time to waste. If I come to Jakarta, I will make sure that we spend at least one day just loafing around: watching movies, drinking coffee, eating ice-cream (zmrzlina) and falling asleep. My GOD, I'm gonna book my ticket already!  Tomorrow is shopping day: my brother and I will go together to central London. He will be able to tell me what looks good and what doesn't: for some reason, I find it really hard to buy clothes (lack of decision again!). Plus he has a grunge style too so he can point me in the right direction. Terima kasih for your nice words about my t-shirt and jeans style. I feel infinitely more comfortable in casual clothes than in a suit. You know, I always thought hmmm, Rini looks very good in her baggy trousers: but then one day you wore a pair of tighter black/grey trousers, and you know what? (I shouldn't tell you this) I couldn't stop myself from staring at your ass, because it looked so good in those trousers. Of course later I discovered that it looked good without ANY trousers ... ;-P  I hope you are prepared, and that you are not over-weight with your baggage at the airport - it would be a shame to waste the £158 on baggage penalties! Have a good flight-lah!   Goodnight purple Rini-Dong  Matthew Bloomsbury-Dong   Hmmm ... so your friend is disappearing from the 'front lines', and retiring to live a quiet life in the Netherlands? Maybe you should go to the wedding: I would love to see the pictures of you in a pink bridesmaid's dress!!!!! ;-P It sounds as though a lot has changed since you have been away: new housemates, changes at work ... a month is a long time in political journalism. Are you glad to see your little room again? I hope you have filled it up with all the things you brought from the UK! And I hope your family didn't eat all the sweets you brought back ... last year's participants fell in love with Cadbury's chocolate, and took back many kilograms of bars with them - the chocolate was one of the main reasons their baggage was so overweight!   Thanks for the phonecalls and the sms messages over the weekend. It was nice to know that ten thousand miles away somebody was wishing me a happy birthday! And I cant believe I spent the whole weekend SHOPPING! I hate shopping, I hate it passionately ... but then I would have been so embarrassed wandering around Italy in my ragged old clothes - my few good clothes would have got dirty very quickly, and I might have even had to wear my suit, my GODD!  As usual I obeyed my prejudices and avoided the shops near where I live, and went to Covent Garden. I didn't find much there, so the next day my brother and I decided to go to Camden - we thought that we might as well visit some local shops first, and to my surprise there was a new shop, full of sk8er clothes ... I am not really a sk8er boi, but I found some nice clothes there and we didn't have to go to Camden at all. But we both really like Camden so we'll go there later on in the summer for a drink. I will remember the good time that you and I had there, and I will say hello to the canal and to the bars for you ;-)  Well little flower, I hope the storm of your first day back didn't damage your roots! It sounds as though you jumped straight back into things: and was offered a position with Reuters as well! Congratulations. Although I can understand if you don't accept it: a few weeks ago, I was offered a job with a charity as a Policy Advisor. I turned it down: not because I didn't like the job, but because I didn't want to commit myself to staying in London for the next few years. Sometimes it's good to take chances, but it's also good if you don't compromise your freedom-lah!   Rini, rini. Two mobile phones, three numbers, two cards - what a crazy life! I am surprised that you have a head of such thick and healthy black hair - you should be bald and grey with the amount of stress that you have. Maybe you have discovered the secret of relaxation: a cool drink, Pearl Jam and a puff of marijuana! Welcome back to Jakarta, anyway: take care of yourself, be good, and let the little devil loose from time to time!  Sayanara  Matthew.   My GOD! I spend three days in Italy and you decide to marry a gay guy! The world moves so quickly. But my initial thought is that it doesn't sound like a bad idea, if you are really so desperate to leave Indonesia straight away. Are you really so desperate to leave? Marrying someone for a visa\\passport sounds very extreme, but then many people say that 'extreme times call for extreme measures'. A gay guy would be the ideal candidate to marry, of course, because it would avoid any potential problems involving love and sex.   I'm really sorry you can't call me (and I cant call you) from here ... I thought that my phone network had an agreement with an Italian company, but I was mistaken-lah! Anyway, I am having a good time so far: the first city we stayed in was quite small and quiet, but today we arrived in Rimini which is a party city, so it should be exciting! The weather is very very hot, and I am melting like an icecream (or a 'gelata' as they are called here). And of course I am becoming even more of an ORANGE BOY!  You know, as I am your diary, you can be my invisible friend while I am in Italy, because on many occasions I have thought while here that it would be good to have you here with me, to walk around with, to see the sights with, to experience this country with. So please don't be alarmed if I have imaginary conversations with you over the next week!  Okay my time in this cyber-cafe is almost finished, so I had better say arriverderci, ciao, and va bene! Molti abrazzi!  Blooby Matthew Bloomsbury   Rini-lah,  Yes I tried to call you from the airport in Italy, to tell you that I had missed my flight and so I wouldn't be able to call you from the UK like I promised, but for some reason the connection didn't work so I couldn't speak to you. Italian public phones - arrrggghh it took me ages to try and understand how to use them!  My GODD, I still really want to be back in Italy! I had such a great time, it really makes me realise how bad my life is here in London, working for PAI. Ohhhhh, to just sit down under a big parasol at a cafe in Bologna, smoke a cigarette, drink a glass of fruit juice and watch the world walk and cycle by!  It's great that I am able to talk to you and send you sms messages again. I was so disappointed when I discovered that my mobile wouldn't work in Italy. But hey, I got some great postcards of each place I visited: Forli, Rimini, San Marino, Bologna, Parma - you can make a display with them when I send them! And don't worry, I will remember to send them to your work address. Can you remind me of that address?  Hey, I also got an email from Runi. I wrote to her to say thanks for the Indonesian dictionary that she left for me, and she wrote back and challenged me to learn Indonesian! She also said 'I know what you did on the final Friday night, which is why you were so tired and couldn't come to the airport' ... MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDD!  Arriverderci l'amica  Matthew, matthew   I still can't stop laughing at that name 'Blooby'. It doesn't have a meaning in English, but it has a certain sound that is funny, a bit like 'blobby' or 'gloopy', which are both slightly disgusting words in English. But even so, I suppose I am getting used to the nickname!  Such a shame that your energy and mood will be wasted on GATRA's assignments, rather than spent on poetry or music. Lucky for GATRA that they will get the maximum of your energy! But it's always the same ... if we spend lots of time at work, then work gets the benefit of our good moods and energies.   That's interesting: the Indonesian Government can't buy British planes. I didn't know that. Does Britain refuse to sell the planes to Megawati's government, or are the planes so bad that Russian planes are considered to be better? A few years ago there was a scandal about British warplanes falling apart at high speeds and killing their pilots.   And congratulations - you won the kite competition! Even if you don't have time to fly it, you can always hang it from the ceiling of your room-lah. It would make a great decoration.   Tomorrow I will take my camera to the developers, and print my pictures. I'll ask them to print two copies, so that I can send you any good pictures, although I warn you, nearly all of the pictures I take look really bad. I can never get it right: always the light is too weak, or too strong, or I am standing in the wrong position, or the picture simply looks boring. This time I tried to take some more interesting pictures, from unusual angles - at one stage I was lying on my back in a Catholic church, taking a photo of the paintings on the ceiling!   Okay Vietnam girl, I'll keep the record of your office address. Now get some sleep in your new redecorated room!  Ciao  Matthew Bloomsbury    Asmayyyyyyyyani KusRINIDONG! You have to make time for yourself, my GOTT. But I hope you managed to finish your assignments. Mr Burhan's daughter must always finish her assignments, or else she will never be able to say, on behalf of all of us, we are very diverse group ya, four of us from printed media, one from NGO ...  I am so glad it's the weekend. For the first two days I returned to the office, my nose and throat felt terrible, and my head felt as though somebody had been sitting on it for a week. The last two days, my head has felt okay, but my nose and throat haven't got the message and so I have had no motivation to work, just to sit around and stare into space ... my GOTT, such a lot of complaints about a stupid case of flu! I should realise how lucky I am!   Have you been able to see any of the others since you returned to Jakarta? I'm curious to know if anyone has been 'changed' by their experiences in London: if Tanto has decided to dress like the people in Soho, or if Pak Franz still continues to look at the naked Page 3 in the Sun paper.   And hey - I am definitely going for another holiday in August! My friend from Ecuador emailed to say that he's booked his ticket, although it wasn't clear if he is flying to Madrid or to Amsterdam (I think it might be Madrid via Amsterdam). I'm so pleased - it's always depressing when PAI just stretches ahead of me without any end! And what about you - are you going to Aceh? Or put back inside the Parliament to cover the annual conferences? Poor Rini-lah, no more adventures, unless you put on your backpack again and run off to the Phillippines, Laos, Thailand ... maybe you can go to Vietnam and, because you look Vietnamese, get a passport and become a citizen, start a whole new life!   Almost time to go hoooooomeee ... arrivederci my friend  Matthew Blooby Bloomsbury   My GOTT, the GATRA office is used as a film location? It must be a really nice office in that case - lucky Rini-DONG to be working there, and to sleep under her desk! I will look out for some Indonesian films in the UK, and if there's an office scene, I will look for you hiding like a mouse under your desk, killing the bugs that are crawling on it!   So it sounds as though everyone is keeping in touch, or most people anyway. If it's Putra's birthday tomorrow, I'd better send him an email. How old will he be? or doesn't he want people to know his age ... ?  The PAI office is quiet today: Don has gone on holiday, and at the end of the week nearly everyone else will be away too, so it will be just me and one or two others, which means I can mess around on the internet all day! I cant wait for that. Don has gone to Egypt, the lucky old bastard, for two weeks. He has so many holidays. Earlier in the year, he went to Barbados for two weeks - and because he went to Barbados, I had to cancel my plans to travel with a friend to Venezuela. I was very angry about that, because I had hoped to spend a couple of days in Ecuador as well to see my other friend. Never mind.   Yes, my flu still loves me. I cannot believe that one human skull can hold this amount of - well, I won't be disgusting, but you can imagine what I am talking about. There is no end to it, it keeps flowing and flowing. It's like nuclear fuel, a continually-renewable resource. Maybe I could find a way to burn it and generate electricity: I could be the eternal power source for the UK!   Oh well. Time to start researching the prices of my flight to Madrid! (OUCHHH it's not going to be cheap)  Ciao bella  Matthew Bloomsbury-DONG   Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr - my GOTT, Rini-DONG, I am so frustrated! I am trying to book a flight to Madrid, but I need to know when the friend I am meeting there is travelling back to London (because the whole point of the trip is to travel back to London with him). I have found a cheap flight - well, quite cheap: it's one hundred and twenty pounds, which is about eighty pounds cheaper than any other flight, and my GOTT, eighty pounds is a lot of money! Yes, even to a terrible Westerner like me, it's a lot of money! I remember when Tanto asked me if I got paid 4000 pounds per month - my GOTTTTTTTT, no way! I don't get ANYTHING LIKE that kind of money!  But I cant book the flight until I know when he is returning, so I keep returning to the website just to check if the special offer is still there, and I just looked now - and it's GONE! I cant believe it! I have sent my friend hundreds of emails, saying plllllleeeeease, let me know when you are flying to the UK, because I cant get my ticket otherwise! And still I have no answer.   It reminds me of when I was hoping to go to Cuba in May ... I was going with a friend who lives in Mexico, and we made plans, I found a flight on some suitable dates and sent her an email saying 'hey, how about these dates?' - and waited ... and waited ... and waited ... and waited ... for a reply ... each day I returned to the website, and each day the price of the flight had increased by five or ten pounds, and after two weeks I realised her lack of response had cost me almost one hundred pounds, so I simply told myself to forget about the holiday.   My GOTTTT - I hate having to depend on other people for my plans! It makes me feel like a child! I think I should follow the Rini-lah example - buy a backpack and just LEAVE!   Oh, listen to me, complaining about all this nonsense! But travelling is such an important thing to me - it's one of the few times that I feel I am really alive, and so I am always anxious for it not to be spoilt, or to give somebody else the control over my happiness!   Hey, today you have become my diary! Sorry Rini-DONG, it's supposed to be the other way round! Never mind. Tell me - did you manage to book a hotel for Bandung? Or will you have to wait for another time? I haven't heard much about Bandung - is it a tourist place, or a big city ... ?  Okay-den, have a nice night-lah!  Bloo.   Ahh - luckily, my bad moods do not last very long. I have now managed to buy some tickets, and I found some that were really cheap! I saved myself over one hundred pounds! I also booked hotel rooms for me and my friend. I will be arriving one day earlier than him, so I can meet him at the airport, take him to the hotel etc - because he, as we say in the UK, 'does not know his ass from his elbow', so I feel that I have to look after him, just like Hermione Granger has to look after Harry Potter. Just like I have to look after Bob and Don and all of the Transition to Democracy group as well, my GOTTTT!  I cant believe that in these two days, I have not done a single piece of PAI work. I have been spending all my time looking for flights, and hotels, and sending emails ... but it's been fun, certainly a lot more fun than working.   My flu has almost left me - for the first time in ages I dont keep coughing every five minutes, and using thousands of tissues each day and sniffing all the time. I can start smoking cigarettes again!!!  My GOTT, a Tea Party at the Ambassador's House! Rini-lah, you really are becoming one of the social elite! Soon you will be telling me that you are going to be a politician, supported by your network of important and powerful business associates! And a meeting with Win Griffith as well, my GOTT. Just make sure you don't oppress me, okay?   So tell me about your travelling. I want to know all the places you have been, which were your favourites, which ones you didn't like, where you want to go to next ...  Almost time to go home, yessss, my GOTT-lah!  Bloo.   Rini-DONG-lah!   The orange Hulk, can you imagine? Raaaaaaahhh!   I'm glad you like the phrase 'doesn't know his ass from his elbow' - it's a typically English phrase, even more a specifically London phrase, and to be pronounced properly you should say 'arse' instead of 'ass'. It's one of my favourite phrases, especially as I seem to have so many friends who don't know their arses from their elbows!   It sounds as though you have a very exciting life as a journalist. But it also sounds as though you have a life that is very immediate, very hectic, and that you don't have time as a journalist to rest, to think, to take a long-term view - you are always in the middle of events and in the middle of the world, instead of being able to take a step back and to look at the world from the outside for a moment. It must be very exciting but also very frustrating.   For me I think it's the opposite. All the time I am standing outside of the world, outside of current events, observing them but not really feeling like a part of them. Maybe we should swap lives for a year! Maybe I should set up an internet exchange society, for people to swap lives with each other for a year ... sounds like a good idea?  I just started reading Che Guevara's Bolivian Diary. As always, whenever I read about Che it makes me desperate to visit Cuba. Sometimes I even get a pain in my stomach and an ache in my legs just thinking about going to Cuba, because I want to go so much. I almost went in May, but my friend cancelled at the last minute and for some reason I decided not to go by myself. I wanted to go last year, but instead chose to visit Ecuador and see another friend. I think I do too much planning and not enough action! What I will do is wait until October or November (when I can take some more time away from work) and go to Havana for a week. If anyone wants to come with me, that's great: if not, I'll just go by myself. I think I have to go to Cuba soon, otherwise I will never have any peace!  That's enough of my complaints. So you are getting excited about the Parliamentary Conference? That's good - it is good to get excited about politics, because politics is so important, although most of the time it is just frustrating when nothing ever changes. Will you be interviewing any of the politicians, maybe even Megawati? Or perhaps Burhan - 'And tonight, a GATRA exclusive: Pak Burhan interviewed by his own daughter!'  I wonder if you will let the devil loose while you are covering the Conference? That could create some headlines ...  Ciao my friend!  Matthew Bloomsbury   Rini-Dong-lah-Dong!  (that can be your Vietnamese name. I think it's a good Vietnamese name)  So you went to a party, then to Bandung, City of Flowers, my gott, such an exciting life, even though it makes you tired!  As for Leicester, it is a city in the middle of the UK, maybe an hour from London by train. Like many cities in the middle (the region called 'Midlands') it has a very large Asian population, so it is quite a cosmopolitan city. I don't know much about the university, but I think it has quite a good reputation.   Higher education is just a term for 'education after high school'. So higher education is just a description of all types of university study. Postgraduate is a more specific term: it relates to courses that are taken after a bachelor's degree, for example a master's or a PhD. Students studying for a bachelor's degree are called 'undergraduates', and students studying for a master's degree or a PhD are called 'postgraduates' - it is simply a way of identifying the different levels of university study.  So to answer your questions: a postgraduate programme is a higher education programme. It is the same as saying 'a car is a machine'. A car IS a machine, but machine also has a wider definition. A car is a type of machine.   And similarly, a master's degree IS a postgraduate degree. It is a specific type or level of postgraduate degree.   And as for postgraduate research programme ... I don't think that is any specific kind of qualification. It is probably a wider term for a number of different master's degrees and Phd's.   And - my god, I just got your sms about the bomb. That's awful - shit, I'd better call u   Ohhhhhh, Rini !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Poor Rini. Rini, rini. Rini-Dong. Rini-dong-lah. Did you manage to get any sleep, at all, in your own room? I hope so, or else you might start to have hallucinations and hear strange voices in your head! But this week you are flying to Bangkok-lah, is that correct? I hope you will be able to get some sleep while you are there.  Maybe sometimes you need to say something if you are given too much work. Surely no boss can expect their workers to keep on working for seven days a week, without any slee",

        "blog_text": "I wanted to touch on physical and emotional abuse separately until I remembered how they often went hand-in-hand. The physical abuse always came first and the emotional abuse almost always began after I broke down and started crying. The pleasure received from watching me cry was obvious and she liked to prolong this feeling for as long as possible. While doing so she would tell me how worthless I was, how ugly I was, that I reminded her of my Father and how much she hated me and wished I had never been born. She would tell me how much she hated me or how much I reminded her of my father because of my “ugly nose.”  Out of jealousy she made me feel bad for being so skinny.  She would constantly do things to make me ugly and make me feel ugly. Sometimes she was just plain mean.    During the winter she would pull the car over, a couple blocks away from our house and tell me she didn’t want me to come home ever again.  Once stranded on the side of the road she would pull up just far enough to still be able to see me in her rear view mirror.  Since I had nowhere to go but home I always walked in that direction.  She would wait until I got to the start of our street, pull up next to me and tell me to get back into the car.  She yelled it in such a way that I felt as if I did something wrong by getting out of the car in the first place.  I don’t think she wanted the neighbors to see me walking home alone in the snow.  They were already talking and it was obvious by their actions how much they had grown to dislike her.  Whatever the form, emotional abuse occurred on a daily basis and I soon preferred the beatings to her mind games.  Sometimes we would go for an entire month without getting into a violent argument but on the average they happened once a week until I was in the latter part of high school.   If you were to have asked my mom, during any stage of my life, if I was well behaved she would have said something to the effect of, “She was always a good kid.”  I remember her saying that to me many times as well as her friends and our counselors over the years. If you gave her the opportunity, she would go on and on about my accomplishments, whether it was something small like doing well in a class, or something big like my music competition awards. As far as my general behavior I can count the amount of times I got into trouble on one hand. My mom thought her morals were very high and sometimes had the aura of being better than others. Because of her attitude and lessons, I learned at a very young age not to act up in public, not to talk back to anyone and most of all not to get into fights, do the things that bad children did or hang out with a bad crowd regardless of my actions. I did, however, skip school once in high school, light all of her prized, formerly untouched, candles once in the seventh grade and often turned the heat up in the house when I was about ten or eleven, which was against one of her many rules. I also defiantly kept a messy room until we moved to California. Besides from those instances, no matter how much good I did or how much I kissed up to my mom, she always looked for or invented a reason to start a fight with me. Around seven years old I learned how to tune my mom out as much as possible during her fits of rage. I will always remember the types of pain inflicted during each beating but I only remember the specific details of what started the biggest fights as I got a little older.   As an unspoken rule, every time my mom either left the house or returned I had to stand at the window adjacent to the driveway and wave. If I didn’t, especially after a hard day at work, she would take it as a sign of aggression and lay into me as soon as she came into the house. Before I could say hello she would yell at me and tell me how worthless and stupid she was. She would often say, “I had a bad day at work and you can’t even come to the window and wave hello when I get home?”  No matter how many times I said I was sorry she wouldn’t accept my apology. On these days the next thing she would do is walk from room to room and inspect all of her belongings to see if anything was out of place. She would also check the thermostat to see if I had touched it while she was away. Sometimes I would follow her around to silently let her know I knew what she was doing. Other times I would stay in the living room just waiting to see what kind of lie she would come up with. The rare times she couldn’t find anything she would drop the subject and let me be. If she thought a picture was out of place or something was missing from where it should have been, she would grab a fistful of my hair and, if necessary, drag me to the part of the house and asked me what had happened. Even though I always knew what would come next I always told her I didn’t touch anything. She would pull my hair harder and harder while pushing me away from her until one of two things happened. I could say that I did and get dragged and beaten around the kitchen or I could say that I did or I didn’t touch what ever it was and start crying. Even though the latter lasted longer I wouldn’t get hit as much. This is how she got her fix. She wasn’t satisfied until she made me sob. I would cry and choke out, “I wish you loved me, I know you don’t,” or better yet, “you know I don’t have any friends, you are my mom and you don’t even like me!”  From those early beatings up until I was in high school this is what she was looking for in one of our fights and it wasn’t until I started up this charade that she would stop hitting me. Instead she would back up as if to get a better view and cross her arms in defiance. She had a look of smug pleasure on her face and didn’t speak a word to me no matter how much I pleaded for her love. I hated this choice with every bone in my body for three reasons. First I hated telling her that I loved her and asking her to love me back just to end everything. I stopped loving her after my Grandma died and these events began to take place. Second, I hated having to tearfully apologize for something I didn’t do. Lastly and most importantly I hated having to let her see me cry. I knew her game. I knew that crying was the ultimate sign of weakness for her. I wanted her to know that she wasn’t bringing me down and that she wasn’t getting through to me emotionally like she had hoped. Inevitably, especially when I was younger, I would tire of the beatings or decide to avoid one and cry. I couldn’t win.   The earliest fight I fully remember happened not long after my Grandmother passed away. My mom was still taking me to my weekly ballet rehearsals and the time had come for my first recital. We were putting together a dance that would go with “The Yellow Rose of Texas.”  My mom wasn’t pleased with having to dish out money to buy my little yellow tutu and in turn when it came to purchasing the white tights that were required for the costume, she refused to buy them. Instead she spent the same amount of money and purchased a pair of Capezio tights in deep tan. When she came home she told me that she thought the brown pair would look better than the white pair.   I was only in the second grade but was already tired of being the one who was different from everybody else. I was the ultra-skinny red-head who was constantly made fun of by the other kids since kindergarten and recently my mom, for reasons I could only imagine, had begun perming my long, stick-straight hair with curls so tight that I literally had what looked like a big afro. At that age I actually thought of it as a clown’s wig. On top of everything else I had just lost my two front teeth. These tights were the last straw.  I raised my voice and reminded her that the flyer that was given out a month prior had specifically said white tights. She smiled and said, “I know,” and walked out of the room. I ran up to my bedroom and silently cried for hours. The next two Saturdays were living hell. They were the dress rehearsals and of course I was the only one with dark tights. Everyone looked at me, laughed and asked if my mom was too poor to buy white tights. The teacher looked at my scrawny legs in horror and said in front of the class, “No, no, no, that is all wrong. You need to get white tights before the recital or you won’t be able to dance with your class.”  As my mom always waited with the other parents in the lobby I wished my teacher had confronted her herself because I thought if I was the one who brought it up she would refuse to buy a new pair of tights for me.  On the night of the recital my mom still hadn’t bought me the correct color tights and despite this she was dumping blue eyeshadow up to my eyebrows and putting red blush on my pale face. I asked her why she was making me get ready if I couldn’t participate. I couldn’t help but start crying. She called me a selfish bitch for not appreciating the pair she had already bought me. She said if I didn’t stop crying she wasn’t going to take me. As she walked out into the kitchen I followed her, closed the bathroom door behind me, slumped down into a yellow ball of lace against the door and continued to cry. My whole body went limp. Some of my first memories and dreams were about music and ballet. My mom had finally found something that would really bother me. As I continued to cry, my mom walked back into the kitchen and threw something at me. When I opened my eyes I saw an unopened pair of white tights lying before me. She hadn’t left the house, which meant she could have had that pair the entire time. Instead of dwelling on the uncalled for abuse I became overwhelmed with excitement. “Hurry up and put those on. We’re going to be late!”  I quickly took my tutu off and changed my tights. I looked in the mirror and breathed a sigh of relief.  The recital went well. We all had a great time and our teacher couldn’t have been prouder of the class. When we took our bows at the end of the routine my mom threw a bouquet of flowers up on stage. I couldn’t make sense of the flowers but all in all they meant a lot to me because this was the first time I was ever on stage.   When my mom and I returned home she decided to take some Polaroids to remember the occasion. The bathroom door was still closed from before we left and she decided the white color of the background would be the perfect backdrop for our pictures. My mom gave me my flowers to hold and told me to smile. As usual my eyes were partly shut because of the flash. Irritated, my mom told me to get ready for another picture. I tried my best this time but my in this picture my eyes were completely closed. When she saw this she became furious. “You are wasting my film. This time keep your eyes open!”  Now I was getting upset. I managed to keep my eyes open but because she was making such a big deal out of getting a good picture I was only able to put on a fake smile. When the picture developed my mom noticed right away. This time she grabbed my hair in the same spot as before and screamed, “You’re so ugly you can’t even take a decent picture!”  The entire evening’s events plus the lump on my head from before brought me to tears. “Stop crying!”  She pulled even harder. “I said stop crying!”  She pushed me back towards the door and put the camera up to her face. In this next picture I had a big open-mouthed fake smile but my eyes were still crying and my eye makeup began to run down my face. In a trance-like rage she yelled “I’m gonna take one more picture and you better look happy, or else!”  This final picture turned out similar to the last one except this time my mouth was mostly closed and the smile looked more like a frown. I really tried. In that picture you could see that all of my energy and spirit had completely escaped from my body. I looked beaten and worn out. Finally she gave up and had enough. Three of these pictures, including the last one are proudly displayed in the photo album she still keeps of me.  Another major fight happened when I was in the third grade. I know this sounds like a total cliché but my mom loved the movie “Mommy Dearest” and insisted on watching it every time it came on television. I dreaded these evenings. It was my mom’s way of confirming to herself that she didn’t treat me the same way Joan Crawford treated her children. After all, she never locked me into my bed and she never threw powder all over the place and left it for me to clean up. Every time we saw those dreaded scenes she would turn to me with a small tear in her eye and ask, “I’m not that bad… right?”  Like reading from an old worn out script I would reply with feigned concern in my eye, “No mom. You’re not that bad at all!” This usually put her in a good mood for the rest of the evening.       That night we had just finished watching “Mommy Dearest” for the fiftieth time. After assuring her over and over that she wasn’t like the mother on the screen, I went upstairs to pick out an outfit for school the next day, which was picture day for our class. Picture day was always a fun event and that night I was on my best behavior so I wouldn’t upset my mom any more than usual. I had begun to realize that my mom, like clockwork, would start a horrible fight right before a big event or an outing.        Earlier in the day my mom had given me notice that she would “inspect” my room that evening. This was sure to include a good two-hour beating and I had already become accustomed to this. These inspections happened about once a month and each time I received the warning I became absolutely terrified. While cleaning I would literally shake uncontrollably the entire time. I did however have my work cut out for me. After about a year of these inspections I had begun to rebel and always left my room in a complete mess. I didn’t do this on purpose. As I look back I realize that after a while I was completely oblivious to the mess I was creating. I believe I was unconsciously showing my mom that her seemingly schizophrenic bouts of anger and abuse didn’t affect me. I knew then and now that it wouldn’t get me anywhere but I couldn’t help it.       After the movie was over I went upstairs and quickly took one last look around for anything that she would consider out of place. Since she couldn’t bend over because of her back injury I made sure that if I had stuffed anything under the bed it couldn’t be seen from any angle in the room. When I looked I saw some dirty clothes that she would surely search for. In a bellowing voice I heard, “I’m coming upstairs now.”  I quickly took the stack of clothes from underneath the bed and put them in my closet. Once I opened my closet I realized that I had forgot to clean it out. Shoes weren’t in order and I had a stack of old school papers on the left side that I had taken out of my backpack and forgotten as well. If she found these she would undoubtedly go off. She took slow, heavy, deliberate steps. There were thirteen steps all together and I counted every one. As she neared half way up I gently closed the closet door hoping she would forget to look in there and went to the top of the stairway. As she made her way up I threw her a nervous smile to try and put her in a better mood. As she got closer to the top of the stairs I seriously considered pushing her down the flight of stairs, after all it would have been the perfect way to kill her so she could never hurt me again.        The reason she didn’t come upstairs to my bedroom more often was because since her back injury, the nerves in her leg didn’t work correctly and whenever she lifted her leg up the slightest bit she felt a lot of pain. Knowing this history, if I pushed her and she died the police would have no problem believing that the fall was an accident. Sometimes on her way up, even though she took very slow steps she wouldn’t raise her leg up enough and would trip. She had always managed to catch herself by grabbing onto the wall in the past but by now she had grown much larger and probably wouldn’t have been able to regain her balance. This is also why I could have pushed her at eight years old. I wasn’t very strong but it wouldn’t have taken much to make her go off balance. This wasn’t the first time I had these thoughts and it wouldn’t be the last. That night I really would have but I had never even laid a finger on her before. I was too scared. So scared in fact that I was in a daze and couldn’t move. When she made it to the top of the stairs I just stared at her face in horror and thought, “I lost my chance.”  She pushed me away and began the inspection. This evening she was very particular. She even looked for dust, which she had never done before. She strutted around my room looking in every nook and cranny. In one of my closets she noticed that a book was missing from my old encyclopedia set. Then she walked over to the orange desk in my room and saw that the middle drawer was not straightened up inside and there were random pencil shavings in it. After looking around for a while she seemed unusually satisfied. As she was getting ready to leave she remembered that she had forgotten about my clothes closet. I was on the other side of my room planning a way to escape when she came after me because the bedroom fights were always bad. When she opened the closet I heard a gasp. “What is all this?”  She yelled at the top of her voice as she threw the small pile of dirty clothes all over the floor. “I knew I couldn’t trust you!  This closet is a fucking mess!”         “I’m sorry I’ll clean it.”  I turned the waterworks on earlier than usual but to no avail. She grabbed a hangar from the closet and barreled towards me only the way my mother could and started beating me as hard as she could on my arms and legs with the thick plastic hangar. I was screamed out in pain and my mother put her hand over my mouth and nose so I couldn’t breathe or scream. She did this a lot. “Don’t you dare scream!  The neighbors will hear you. If they call the police I will hurt you so bad…”  Even after I stopped screaming she wouldn’t take her hand off of my face until I started freaking out, trying to get air. I began flailing my arms and became scared for my life but she let go before I started to pass out. I was left on the floor choking and gasping for badly needed air. Just then she came back with the hangar and whipped me some more. She was always more violent during the winter months than she was during the warmer ones. Winter clothes left less bruised skin for everyone to see. She did this for a half hour straight (I always watched my clock which seemed to stand still). Suddenly she stopped beating me and grabbed my hair once again. “Let’s go downstairs right now.”  I had no idea what she was planning to do next because she had never taken me downstairs the other times. As she began her descent down the stairs I realized I had yet another chance to push her. I wondered how she could be so stupid to let me follow behind her. As we neared the end of the stairs I realized I had lost my chance again. I was upset because this time would have been much easier since her back was towards me. When we got downstairs she once again grabbed my hair and brought me into the kitchen. She said, “Wait here,” and left the kitchen for a few minutes. When she came back she had a pair of scissors in her hand and I started crying again. She turned me away from her and said, “How dare you!  Your room was not up to my standards.”  She grabbed a chunk of hair on my left side and slowly and agonizingly cut it off. “Oh, too bad tomorrow is picture day,” she said in a sarcastic voice, “it’s too late now to go to a hairdresser and you will never be able to fix it yourself. Just imagine what everyone is going to think about you tomorrow!”        “How could you do this to me?      “How?  Well, how come you treat me like you do?  I work at a crappy job all day and have to come home to this?  I hate you and I hate my life. In fact…” Her voice drifted off as she walked to the other side of the kitchen. She walked over to the drawer where she kept her big knife. It was some kind of a hunter’s knife and the blade was about seven or eight inches long and two inches wide. She grabbed it, pulled it out of its sheath and held the tip right up to her skin over her heart. You could see it pushing slightly into her breast.      “Do you want me to kill myself?”      “No mom, no.” a million things ran through my head, all completely selfish.      “I’ll do it I’ll stab myself right now. Do you really want to lose me?”  She sounded possessed and pressed the knife even harder against her breast.      “No, don’t do it. What will I do without you?”  I was concerned about being homeless, losing my friends and my dog. I didn’t care about her.       She put the knife down onto the counter and started sobbing. She soon put the knife back in its leather holder and put it away. I immediately ran back upstairs to my room crying. I didn’t care about my mom’s drama. It wasn’t the first time that scenario had played out. I was concerned about myself.        Since the year before, my curly perm had grown out into straight hair that fell a few inches below my shoulders. In the mirror I saw that my mom had taken off about two inches from the left side and as I had expected, and even though it could have been worse, it was obvious. The next day came and I tried to compensate for my shorter hair by tilting my head slightly to the side all day. When it came time to do pictures the old man insisted I keep my head up straight. I felt my face redden and he took my picture. I could have died. Unbelievably, my teacher never asked me what happened to my hair even though the other kids did. I told them I got bubble gum in my hair and had to cut it out myself.       Usually my mom was the queen of incomplete threats, or should I say, actions.  She tried to kill me quite a few times.  She would have succeeded if she hadn’t just gone through the motions.  She tried to suffocate me numerous times by placing her hand over my mouth and nose.  She almost always alternated between pressing hard and letting up just enough for air to come through.  There were many times, however, when she refused to lighten her grasp.  When I tried gasping for air, I only made the seal between her hand and my face tighter. I don’t remember looking into her eyes.  I was so scared during these moments that I could do nothing but flail my arms around and squeal as loud as possible, knowing it wasn’t loud enough for anyone to hear, even if the windows were open.  She had done such a good job of brainwashing me into total submission that I wasn’t smart enough to try and fight her off me.  I might not have been able to pull her hand off my face but I could have kicked her and startled her.  I hate those memories.       I also hate the times we went to the beach.  Two summers in a row she took me as far out as the ropes allowed in the water and physically tried to drown me.  After that first summer I knew what to expect.  For “safety reasons” she made me stick by her even though I was good swimmer.  She would pretend to get playful and I knew to stay as far away from her as I could.  Unfortunately she had trained me like a dog and I was powerless to her anger and beckoning. Once I started to swim away from her she would yell, “Get back over here.  Don’t you swim away from me!” Like a patient under hypnosis I did what she said. “Come here,” she said while playfully splashing me.  She knew I hated that.  I did my best to stay above water to wipe the water out of my eyes.  She always got me to choke by doing this as well.  The more I told her to stop the more she splashed.         When I got to the point where lake water was coming out of my nose she would move in laughing as if it was the funniest thing she had ever seen.  She would put her hand firmly on top of my head and pushed me under water.  Not yet recovered from the first flooding of water into my lungs I gasped a barely audible, “Stop!”  Right in the middle of a good choke she pushed me down again, this time somehow pushing me into a forward roll. I needed air.  I was disorientated and opened my eyes in an attempt to distinguish up from down in the murky water. I followed the few bubbles I managed to push out and found my way back up.  Frantically throwing up and gasping for air I yelled, “Stop! I can’t breath!” This time I was loud.  This time I caught her eyes.  She wasn’t laughing at that moment.  The look on her face wasn’t of concern either.  It was an eerie moment, which passed in slow motion.  It’s hard to describe but the look on her face wondered, “Is she going to make it?”  There was the slightest bit of fear in her face as well.  In that moment of desperation I heard her thoughts clearly in my head.  She looked around to see how many people were around us.  Fortunately a group of people swam over and began playing near us.      “Oh stop,” she said nonchalantly as if speaking to a child who was whining for no reason.  Once I had my breath I started crying hysterically.       “You almost drowned me!”      “No I didn’t.” Her tone of voice was almost sarcastic.  She said it in a way that anyone within hearing distance would think I was making it up.  This was the second summer she tried this and I wasn’t sticking around to see if it would happen again.  I swam towards the shore and towards safety.  That was the last time we went to the beach together.        Over the years I told both my Cousin and eventually my husband.  Both said, “Maybe she was just playing around.” Knowing they thought I was exaggerating infuriated me.  I was, and still am, speechless. By the time I was in seventh grade I was a poster child for the emotionally disturbed. This was the first time I realized how bad my life was. One afternoon I returned home from school severely depressed. I knew I had hit a low point. I felt sheepishly destructive and needed an outlet.        I went to my backpack and got out a stack of index cards and threw them into the bathroom sink. I grabbed a matchbook from the kitchen and proceeded to light the pile of cards on fire. At first I just wanted to start the fire for the sake of starting a fire; that’s why I did it in a sink in case it got out of control. I knew what I was doing was wrong but I felt miserable and revengeful towards my mom. I couldn’t stop myself. In a small way I thought if I could start this fire and not get caught I would have won the game.        As the flame grew I suddenly felt thirteen years of rage fire up as well. While the fire was burning I ran into the bathroom closet and grabbed one of those pornographic books and started ripping out the pages and placing them into the fire. After the pages turned to ashes I ran into the living room and grabbed the photo album. I took my third grade class photo, the one with the chopped off hair, ran back into the bathroom and put that in the fire as well. I did the same thing with the last 5X9 photo of my third grade picture. Now they were gone forever. Then I did the same with my second grade class picture with the afro, my two missing front teeth and the ugly green vest with the matching green and white Girl Scout turtleneck. Once those pictures had melted I turned the water on until the ashes cooled off. Finally, I ran around the house with the matchbook and lit every single one of her plain candles that she had been collecting for years and never burned once. Once they were all lit I walked from room to room and watched how each candle burned differently.        In an instant I snapped back to reality and realized what I had done. I ran around the house blowing out all of the candles and tried to salvage the ones that hadn’t been burning for quite as long, but it was futile. Then I remembered the mess I had left in the bathroom. With that thought I looked at the clock and realized I only had an hour lose the ashes, get the black out of the porcelain. Most importantly I had to get rid of the smell that by now had invaded the entire house. I took the ashes and stuffed them into a plastic grocery bag. I let the sink soak and opened doors and windows while I tried to figure out where to stash the bag so my mother wouldn’t it. After careful consideration I decided to throw it way back in our backyard where my mom never went. The back of the yard was like a dense forest and would be easy to hide back there. I ran back into the house, finished cleaning the sink and was finally able to close the doors and windows. There was nothing I could do about the candles but maybe she wouldn’t notice.        When it was time for her car to pull up I waited anxiously by the window for my mom’s homecoming. I prayed that she wouldn’t notice a strange smell. When she came home I greeted her outside like I normally did when I really needed her to start out in a good mood. When we walked inside I watched her face for any signs of that smell. Nothing. “I can’t believe I pulled this off. Oh my gosh, I’m never doing anything like that again, thank you God!”  I went past her to walk into the bathroom and she exclaimed, “What is this?”  I thought the worst. I turned around and followed her stare down to a single burnt match sitting on the kitchen counter. “Oh shit, oh shit, think fast,” I thought. “It’s just a match mom.”      “What is it doing out here?  What the hell did you do?”      “Nothing mom, I don’t know, maybe you lit a candle and forgot about it or something.”  What did I just say?  I just left the door wide open. She started moving forward and looked at me with one of those “oh no you didn’t” looks on her face. I followed her into the living room where she immediately noticed how every one of her candles had been lit.       “You burnt my candles?”        “No!  Maybe you did it.” I should have said yes.      “You asshole, you burnt my candles?  You burnt the candles I received from your cousin for Christmas?  Come here you fucking…” Her words became softer as she rushed over to me and slapped me as hard as she could on my ear. The clock said 5:30pm. She slapped me again on my cheek. 5:31pm. I knew this would be a long night and honestly I didn’t think I would make it.       My mom had limited strength and endurance and therefore wasn’t able to hit me with full force for too long. She would have rather pulled my hair (her favorite means of punishment) or kicked me while I was lying on the ground. I believe she was also unconsciously scared that she would one day go too far and kill me on accident, even though she stated many times how that was her goal. This night was different.       For the next three hours the beating was relentless. It was so bad that our dog cowered in fear underneath a chair for the entire evening as he often did when there was trouble around the house. At one point my mom, once again, had grabbed my hair and pulled me into the kitchen. My nose had started to bleed a little, my lip was bleeding, my ears were ringing from the hits, and I had two or three lumps on my head, not including the one that was in the making at that very moment. She pushed me up against the wall and put her hand around my throat. She had tried to suffocate me with her hand many times before but she had never actually choked me like this. I started to black out, not because of the choking but because I really thought she was going to kill me. The thought terrified me.        She wouldn’t let go so for the first time in my life I reached out towards her and pulled her hair like she had mine so many times before. It was like a dream where you can’t run. I immediately felt shaky and weak and I don’t think I was able to her hair very hard. Astonished she backed up in silence and just stared at me in disbelief. She made a fist and went to punch me and at the same time I made a fist and was planning to punch her in the face or at least block hers but instead I just flinched.       “How dare you raise a fist to your mother!”  With that mistake she used my hair to throw me onto the hard tile floor with enough force to make me slide into the kitchen door. She began to kick me as hard as she could and was yelling obscenities the entire time. After what seemed like eternity she stood back and looked down at me with crazy eyes and spit on me.      “I hate you more than I hate your father. You are just like him. I hate how much you remind me of him. You’re worthless.” She spit on me two more times and left the room. I couldn’t get up. I can’t remember if I was crying or not but I do remember the unbearable pain and loneliness I felt right then. I remember thinking if I could get up I could grab the big knife in the drawer and end it all right here. Maybe during the autopsy the pathologist would see the tear on my lip and the small amount of blood on my nose. Maybe he will see the bruises on my arm and the lumps on my head. Maybe in the end they wouldn’t believe that it was a suicide. They might think that my mom actually did it. I was seriously considering it but my mom walked back in.       “Go put on your pajamas and come back down here when you’re finished.”  I did what she said, still dazed, and still in pain.”  I went back downstairs. Come in here,” Her voice was coming from her bedroom. “You don’t deserve to sleep in a bed tonight. You have to sleep right here on the floor while your dog sleeps with me in bed.”  I started to cry but she made me sleep there until it was time to get ready for school.             Later that winter, while in the car with my mom, she pulled over and started to cry. When I asked her what was wrong she apologized for being such a horrible mother. She said, “I never meant to do any of this to you. I know you can’t be happy living with me so I’m going to give you a choice. You can either stay with me or I can turn myself in and you can go live with a foster family. I promise I won’t get mad if you decide to go.”  She sat in silence waiting for my answer. She wanted the answer right then and there. Deep down I knew she was being sincere but there was still a part of me that was terrified of giving her the answer she didn’t want to hear. I was also afraid of moving away from my friends and my school. Even though I hated my life so much I was comfortable. After what seemed like an eternity of silence, the scared and weak side of me answered, “No mom. I love you and want to live with you.”      “Are you sure?  I can’t guarantee that I will never hit you again but I will try.”      Despite knowing that hitting me was like a drug habit to her I answered, “Ya, I’m sure.”       As she pulled back onto the road I got a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. Had I made the right choice?  Was I just too scared to say no?  This was my first of three defining moments that would change my life and my spirit forever.      Over the years my mom had made it a habit to find a reason to get in a fight with me right before an important school event like an orchestra or chorus recital. Her punishment was to try and take the one thing away from me that meant the most, my music. Luckily I always managed to get a ride from either a friend or a teacher. One evening, an hour before my orchestra concert my mom did the inevitable. Not long before the night of the concert I had finally moved up to a full-sized violin. Since it was bigger than my previous one I used to joke around and call it my viola. As we were about to leave I mentioned that I had to run upstairs to get my “viola”. Apparently my mom didn’t appreciate my music humor. She didn’t say anything right away but by the time I came back into the room she had decided that she would use that comment against me. In a calm, sarcastic voice she said, “I don’t think you take your music seriously. I pay all that money each month to rent your violin and you disrespect it by calling it a viola. I’m not taking you tonight, you have to find your own ride.”  I didn’t feel like going through this once again so I immediately opened the floodgates and pleaded for her forgiveness and begged her to take me. When she said no and started to undress I lost it. I yelled, “I hate you!  Why can’t you just take me like a normal parent?”  It was a stupid thing to say but you don’t mess with my music. She turned around and put all of her weight into her footsteps so that the whole house shook. She pushed me into a wall and put her hand around my throat. She was too chicken to really choke me. She was just going through the motions to try to scare me. At the same time she was pulling my hair and the words “ungrateful fucking bitch” flew out. For the first time in my life I went to grab her. Out of some kind of deranged respect I had never laid a finger on her. I went to throw a punch at her but instead I threw my hand up and started to pull on her curly hair. As soon as I did that I was mentally beating myself up for not punching her. I was skinny but I was strong and even though it would have been so wrong I still believe to this day that if I had hit her, the fight would have been over right then and there. Her anger and delusions were fed on the weakness I emitted. Instead the fight went on for another ten minutes. She pushed me onto the ground and started dragging me around by my hair in an attempt to get dirt all over my black outfit. She then said, ”Ya, you go to your little concert looking like this and see what they say.”  I could tell she was serious so I quickly got up and ran upstairs to my room. That year Kari was in the Orchestra as well so I called her up and asked her for a ride. Thankfully Kari always ran late so I managed to get a hold of her just before she left the house. Sobbing, I told her what had happened and she said she would be right over. I straightened out my hair and dusted off my clothes with some tape before I went back downstairs and told my mom who was coming to get me. My mom was livid. She knew Kari knew about her abusive ways but wasn’t sure if her mom, Kathy, had known. Either way she would know for sure that evening. Now was also the time to ask my mom if I could stay over at her house that night. My mom agreed in an attempt to quiet things down before Kathy came over and saw what was going on. There were stipulations though. The only way I could stay the night was if I found a specific suitcase to take. I was only spending one night over there but my mom insisted I take the biggest suitcase she owned. If she couldn’t beat me in front of Kathy she would make damn sure that I was embarrassed. She wouldn’t tell me where it was so I was starting to get nervous. As I heard Kari and her mom pulling up I decided that I wasn’t going to play her game. I couldn’t find the suitcase and I knew I could borrow some of Kari’s clothes and toiletries in the morning. My mom watched me walk out of the house without saying a word. As I walked down the driveway and got closer to their car my composure quickly went away. As soon as I made Kari’s shadow out inside of the car I started crying. She opened the door and hugged me harder than anyone had ever hugged me before. Just as Kathy began to back out of the driveway, a suitcase came flying out of the garage door. Surprised, Kathy slammed on the brakes. My mom came next in all of her glory, screaming at the car. Before the suitcase came to a halt I had already opened the car door not sure what to do. I head my mom yell, “It doesn’t matter if you ruin this one…” She kept yelling and trying to get me to walk over to where she was. Kathy calmly said, “Lynn, get into the car.”  I did just that and we drove away.        As we drove off the first thing out of Kathy’s mouth was, “I’m going to see about adopting you.”  I could tell that she said that in the heat of the moment. Kari had brought it up a couple times with her in the past year but, as I fully understood, Kathy couldn’t take on that kind of responsibility. One time while I was over at her house, she told me she had considered taking me in but she wasn’t sure if she could afford it. She said she was going to have a difficult time sending Kari off to college let alone paying for both of us to go. Knowing she considered this was more than I could have ever expected from anyone. That was the kindest gesture anyone has ever given me to this day.        Once we moved to California",

Lighting the candles, I felt a fleeting sense of reclaiming something that was never mine.

SHE IS STILL THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.  and though right now i know the future is bleak for us, i am certain of how i feel about her.  but i have to move on.  yesterday i went to the grocery. saw several women with their kids and i couldn't help but feel envy. envy that the kind of life we had planned together will most likely not happen. then i figured maybe i should go straight na lang. maybe that is my destiny. whatever power and reason brought me to her and her to me, i do not know. nor am i too eager to find out why. but for now, i am considering opening my doors to the straight life. not for love but for a quiet, perhaps more boring, life. maybe i should have kid/s, a husband whom i do not feel passionately for but at least respect. or maybe no husband. just me and my kid/s. no more traveling to foreign places, being silly and adventurous. no more laughing out loud, animated discussions about anything and everything, and passionate, hot and always a scream (excuse the pun) making love sessions. oh well.  i thought i was the luckiest person in the world when we found each other.  i can hear her asking, 'then why didn't you take care of us?'",

I can see from their eyes and actions the apprehension; something no one will truthfully bother to bring to my awareness. In fact, I am starting to suspect that they are keeping me in a cage where I can never outlive my past. What have people around been talking about me? Indeed, should there have been any gossips in the days long gone to pass, the deed made a lasting impression. It is very disappointing, too discouraging. A truly good friend is one who allows my past to stay in the past and place me in a field of possibilities. Unfortunately, those I have been keeping company with have kept me in a cage for too long. I want to change but they keep me where I used to be. I need time to myself since those people aren't that encouraging anyway. Virginia was right. I am a person who will constantly seek changes. And I believe it will be a change for the better. Too long have I comment on my ambitions and great ideals. Too long have I not given results. No one I know give even a hint of encouragement, with only passing remarks of casual concerns. Some even mock me for showing only verbal images. How's that for friendship?? Not only aren't they helpful, they bring you down. Is it intentional? I don't think so. Subconsciously, maybe. Those who aren't great achievers will think lowly of themselves and believe others are no different from them, thus imposing a selfish standard to how much others are capable of. When people are not showing results, that reassures their presumptions. And when they hold that belief as true, every statement we make about what we are going to achieve will sound like a lie to them, and a gradual lost of faith to what we stand for. Is this the voice of my self-esteem? From Venerable Mahinda's public talk, I picked up a formula that struck a bell, an equation from those self-help doctrines: Self-Esteem = Achievements/Expectations. Perhaps that is true, but what I have observed is not as simple as it seems. It goes a long way back to who I have been and who I still am in their memories. This is what I should be telling myself everyday: Say not what you are going to do, say only what you are doing. Think of the next step while keeping to yourself the big picture. Share only with people you think can accept you no matter what the results are, as long as you are trying your best. Seek help only when you are already making the effort.

What else can I do?' then the old man stood up and stretched his hands towards heaven. His fingers became like ten lamps of fire and he said to him, 'If you will, you can become all flame.' \nThis is, perhaps, my favorite of all the Sayings of the Desert Fathers.  To be honest, I'm not sure I really understand it.  I'm not sure I understand many of the stories and sayings about the Desert Fathers.  But I relate to Abba Lot.  Often I feel like I'm doing good.  I'm praying regularly, in the word regularly, practicing spiritual disciplines regularly.  Still, there is a longing for more.  'Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?'  Abba Joseph seems to be pointing Abba Lot beyond the mere practices of Christianity.  One could pray all the hours of the daily office, meditate, be peaceful to all and have pure thoughts, but if these practices do not change the person into the image of Christ, they are for naught.  To become 'all flame' is to become all one can become of God.  To fully participate in the divine nature.  To become what we desire.  The goal of the Christian life is to be transformed into Christ-likeness.  This is the 'more' of our longing.  To be like Christ is to become what we were created to become. \nWe can do all the actions of Christianity and never become anything beyond ourselves.  But if we will, we can become all flame.  We can become the people Paul describes in 1 Corinthians 3:18:  'And all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the glory of the Lord as though reflected in a mirror, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord, the Spirit.'",

        "profile": "An adult, likely male, practicing Christian with a disciplined and introspective personality. The individual consistently engages in spiritual practices such as prayer, meditation, and self-examination, and demonstrates a longing for deeper spiritual transformation.",
        "behavior": "Engages in regular prayer, meditation, and the deliberate pursuit of spiritual disciplines while reflecting on the deeper meaning and desire for transformation beyond external practice.",
        "motivation": "I am faithfully practicing prayer, meditation, and striving to live peacefully and with pure thoughts. Yet, I sense an inner urge that there must be something more—an authentic transformation that goes beyond routine actions. My heart yearns to become more like Christ, to pursue the fullness of what I am created to be, and not simply be satisfied with outward religious observance. I seek a deeper communion, a way of being that aligns fully with my spiritual aspirations.",

        "blog_text": "We are a one-car family. In a city whose blood runs black with oil, and where a love affair with cars better distinguishes citizens than a sports team or even Texas history, we've become something like martyrs precisely because we continue to be a one-car family. John takes the bus every day from downtown to NASA, a 45 minute ride before 9/11 and a 60-70 minute ride since. He learned to fill the time with checking and returning emails and reading his daily myriad of government documents, the nature of which Al Gore tried so valiantly to distinguish in the federal government. Last month John bought a scooter off ebay, an electric Zappy, that was supposed to alleviate the many obstructions people eagerly inserted to the Houston commute in the name of 9/11. The first week he had the scooter, he was quickly tied up in a battle of legalities at NASA. After that, he enjoyed one blissful week of riding the scooter before he broke it by hitting a curb and breaking the rubber belt. Since then, we've tried in vain to replace the belt, but until we succeed, his commuting problems continue to abound. I'm not sure what value there is in having a gigantic federal government try to slightly downsize itself by outsourcing everything, but decentralization is the Soma of our electorate, and in a day and age where the motivation is fear and attitudes in the federal government resemble Salem, MA more than Arthur's round table, inviting contractors from around the world to submit bids for, say, equipment on the Space Station is, er, challenging. So instead of hosting meetings at JSC this week, John is tied up at the ever illustrious, and by illustrious I mean tacky, Nassau Bay Hilton. Needless to say, the Hilton not only lacks a bus stop, but is pretty far from the bus route. That is how I found myself at REI last night buying a bike trailer. Because, damn it, we're a one-car family. We believe in New Urbanism and Green Development, and we even sacrificed our first child, the Vehicross, to these ideals. John brilliantly finagled this deal where we got the website sale price of $270 off $400 at the store and didn't have to pay the shipping from the website. This morning, like the good soldier I am in the battle to save our planet, I woke up early, fed and dressed the kids, and loaded them into our brand new Burley D'Lite. The problem is, Houston is not made for anything but a car, and an SUV at that. That's not the only problem. Ellie isn't keen on her helmet, and the nylon straps have to hold her in the seat in lieu of her physical development capabilities. The trailer doesn't have shocks so the kids are jarred at every pothole, and in Houston, potholes are so prolific that they were actually the deciding issue in the last mayoral election. As I bravely navigated the sidewalks and streets, I planned letter-writing campaigns to refurbish the sidewalks and giant mobilizations of handicapped and liberal one-car families where we march hand in hand demanding safe pedestrian ways. I got Aidan to school only 45 minutes late. The return was punctuated by Ellie's now over-tired cries and a nasty showdown with a semi-truck. It was totally his fault. He saw me in plenty of time to give me room to pass, but instead kept turning until he blocked both lanes of the street he was coming from and both lanes of the street he was turning onto, the street where I was stopped waiting for my light to turn green. My valour quells when my baby daughter is in the seat behind me, so instead of standing him down, I had to pick up the bike and the trailer, a feat of physical strength and coordination, and move onto the sidewalk. But from the safety of the sideline, I stood the most defiant stance I could muster, considering I was straddling a bike, wearing a helmet, and pulling an infant. I flicked my hand at my chin at him and he made hand gestures back to me. I saluted my middle finger triumphantly high in the air and yelled as loud as I could over his uber-engine, 'fuck you you fucking bastard!' It may not have been a proud moment, but it was a human one. At this point I was just a few blocks from home and the rest of the ride was uneventful. John asked if the experience was a complete failure, and I could only say that the system needed an overhaul in order to survive, but that I plan to take the bus this afternoon.",

It’s a matter of dignity—I need to assert my presence and defend my family's right to use these streets safely, even in the face of a system that constantly disregards us.",

Puyat. Pagod. DI makatulog. Puno ng adrenaline ang katawan. Mabilis ang tibok ng puso. Hindi makahinga. Walang ganang kumain. Walang maisip kundi siya. Iyan ang nararamdaman ko. Siya lang ang laman ng aking isipan. Tatlong taon iyon… Medyo mahabahaba rin…   Isa sa mga taong malapit na kaibigan ko, hinahangaan ko, inirerespeto ko ay may gusto sa babaeng pinakamamahal ko sa buong mundo. Mukhang nagkakaigihan na sila.  Nalulungkot akong isipin na ganito ang sitwasyon ko.   Miserable. Basura. Tae. Ako.  Lahat ng nabanggit ko sa itaas, halos magkapareho lang ang meaning; Miserable, Basura, Tae, Ako.  Pero ako, isang basura, tae, miserable, ay nagmamahal sa isang tulad nya. Parang lupa at langit. Siyempre, ako yung lupa, mukhang lupa, amoy lupa. Lintek. Basura.  Wow… Napaiyak ako kaninang nagbabalat ng sayote. Hindi dahil katabi kong nagbabalat ng sibuyas ang kapatid ko (pero factor na rin yun), kundi dahil inisip ko na kahit ayaw NYA (si kwan), at di nya ako type, at may kasama siyang iba (osmeone else) at kahit inaakbayan siya ng isa sa pinakasusuklaman tao ko sa buong planeta (yung kaklase ko) , susubukan ko pa ring iparating ang nararamdaman ko. Dahil alam ko na pag hindi ko ginawa ito, bubulabugin ako ng kunsensya ko habang nabubuhay ako. Mahal ko siya, at kahit sabihin niya na ayaw nya sa akin, “this time” okay lang baka ikasiya ko pa nga, dahil BAKA sakaling makalimutan ko siya, maalis siya sa background ng isip ko, kahit pansamantala lang. Pero siyempre, pipiliin at mas gugustuhin ko rin na sagutin niya ako, na magkasama kami, dahil, iyon naman talaga ang pangarap ko eh, kahit masaklap, gagawin ko pa rin, wala naming mawawala sa akin. Mahal ko naman siya.  Dahil na rin sa iniisip ko na isinayaw ko siya nung prom at minsan ding nakipag-kantahan sa kanya sa attic ni Paolo, mga masasayang alaala, mga alaalang di mabubura sa aking isipan kahit mabulok na ko si lilalim ng lupa.  Siguro, para sa iyo’s walang kwenta ang pinagsusulat ko…  Pero, umaasa akong maiintindihan mo dahil ito ang effect pag naiinlove ka sa taong alam mong malabong magkagusto sa iyo. Nasisira ang ulo ko(see: di makatulog, yung babae lang yung iniisip part sa bandang itaas.).   Siguro, para sa iyo, nag-sesenti lang ako ditto, nagsusulat, pero ako si Karl Sampang, kung hindi ako nakakatulog sa kaiiyak dahil sa mga problema ko, isinusulat ko lahat ito, para mailabas sa isipan ko, ito ang therapy ko.  Siguro, para sa iyo, isa lang akong tanga, na namamagasang mahalin din siya ng minamahal niya, may phrase para sa sitwasyon ko, at kung tama ang pagka-recall ko, “unrequited love” yata ang tawag.  Siguro, para sa iyo, isa ako sa mga lalaking torpe.  Nagkakamali ka, hindi ako torpe, may pagka-walanghiya pa nga ako eh. Natunaw yata siya sa hiya nuong 2nd year highschool kami, nung maglakad ako sa iskwela na may karatulang naglalaman ng nararamdaman ko para sa kanya. “I love you, Thet…” pa nga ang nakasulat, kung ‘di ako nagkakamali. Oo, gago ako, tanga ako… alam ko…  Siguro, para sa iyo, isa lang akong bata. Hindi pa alam ang tunay na ibig sabihin ng salitang, “mahal”, “I love you” at iba pa. Diyan ka nagkakamali.   Siguro nagsasawa ka na sa kakasabi ko ng salitang siguro. Pero alam mo, napagisip-isip ko na, siguro kung sineryoso ko lang ang buhay ko ng konti, mas mabuti ang sitwasyon ko ngayon. Gago kasi ako eh… Tanga, Bobo, Gago, Ungas, lahat-lahatin mo na.

Her mother in turn became a bitter closet alcoholic, spending the next three years wearing the same unwashed, mauve bathrobe around the house, cutting coupons and obsessively monitoring day time television for evidence that the gays and the Mexicans are taking over the nation. After three years of being lost at sea, her mother stumbled upon the good faith after seeing the church's ad in the local section of the newspaper; she quickly converted herself and her two young children. At the age of 12, she walked into the shed in her backyard and caught her older brother having sex with a respected town councilman (and father of the most popular girl in school); her brother had his face painted delicately with make-up and their mother's best Sunday dress crumpled on the floor around his ankles. She subconsciously swore off make-up, sex and overt gender-identification from that moment on. She was an average student and went on to study computer science at the local community college.

Winters… the time to make stories, time to feel easygoing & time to be a fairy in real life! This is how I see winters, nice & slow like romance & wild & unpredictable like isolated islands at the same time. It’s got the wisdom of a mature aged leader & yet mischievous laughter of a 5-year-old. It’s young as snow & old as time. I always wonder how it could be so complicated & simple simultaneously….   Right now I’m sitting by the window, looking over the city I love so much.  A blanket of snow covers Tehran’s body. It covers viciousness & gloom & leaves the city pure & virgin.  It seems to cast away all differences… there is only one color White, silver, or what you may call it… nothing but spotless clarity.  Winters holds some kind of a feminine character if you know what I mean. In Persian myths, winter fairy in an old woman. But I love to consider the winter goddess as young beautiful fairy, dressed in white robe… with jasmines in her hair. She passes by & spreads silver flakes of snow… or simply she sits by fireplace narrating tales which never ends.   This season is sort of family season too. Over here in Iran we sit around the living room & safe in the security & warmth of houses we spent long winter nights together. Folks tend to spend more time at home & stay close to the one they love. It sounds winter bonds us all together….  Children love this season! Schools would be closed after heavy snows & kids just go out to play, make snowmen & enjoy their unexpected day off! As a kid I used to pray for heavy snow… not that I didn’t loved the school but the temptation of staying in my bed under comforter & watch snowflakes melt hitting my window was so strong; it would erase the school from my mind!   I must declare I’m still praying for snow…. & still I spend most part of the morning (if I would be free) in my bed, watching white flakes, sipping my cup of tea & daydreaming! Alright I guess I never stop the daydreaming part…. What else I do in winter? Hum? I play with snow…. I gathered winters bring the child inside of me back! Sometimes I just put on my warm overcoat & grab umbrella to go for a walk, the best thing you can do in heavy traffic. It’s amazing to watch people hurrying around, trying to get home as soon as possible.   Wow, enough for now! I will write about winter costumes in Iran next time… till then enjoy your winter….",

Love: A deep, tender, ineffable feeling of affection and solicitude toward a person, such as that arising from kinship, recognition of attractive qualities, or a sense of underlying oneness.   For whatever I say I want you to know I love you and I want to stay with you  This was writing when I was sad and angry, please don't take any offense  I LOVE YOU  the prettiest people do the ugliest things   Today is Saturday the 10th of July....  We are breaking up, I don't know why. I'm here waiting.. waiting for something to happen, waiting for someone to love, you told me last night you were going to call me from the looks of it it doesn't seem like you are going to call, but I'll be here waiting, waiting for that phone to ring, waiting for that 'I love you' to come.  So I'm here, thinking about you like INSANELY CRAZY, I'm crying... there is nothing I can do now, there's is nothing I can say. I know now that I wasn't meant to love someone, I'm not meant to be loved by someone, I wasn't meant to be with someone.... God hates me.  I'm reading your letters, you were so much in love with me... All of the things you said have now turned into lies. Stef I love you please please don't let this go, don't let me go, I gave you my heart 'no take backs' for as long as I live you will always have it. It hurts, the thought of you, with another person while holding my heart, it hurts loosing you, it it... Feels like death.  There is two sides of me, my logical side which believes Teen dating is overrated and completely pointless because there is no way you can keep Two kids in love with each forever, he is more pesstimistic. My other side is hard to explain his the one you know the best the one that wants to be with you forever the one that doesn't listen to the logically thing, the one that sees light at the end of the tunnel.  I don't think I can move on... I'm going to do the illogical thing and pour my heart out to you, but first I'm going to show you how you poured your heart out to me.....        1st letter...  Dear Carlos~  What's up? Nothing much here. I thought I would send you this picture even though it doesn't look like me anymore. Right now you are working and I just finished working out, I love you so much. I really want to meet you as soon as possible, it is driving me crazy. I am nervous about it though. I don't want to lose you ever, you already mean so much to me, I don't know what I would do if I were to lose you so soon. This picture is from October at a friend's b-day party. I hope I see you soon and I love you honey!   Con Amor,  Stefanie     2nd letter...  Carlos  Hey Honey-  What's up? I'm so so bored so I decided to write you a letter. You are at work right now and I'm sitting outside, my dad came him tonight and he is working outside. Four more days and I will hopefully be seeing you, but by the time you get this it will be less than that. I was talking about it with Abigail today and we got really nervous. I hope everything works out between us. It is a huge mess with me, you, and Alexa. I don't Hanna lose you and I don't wanna give you up. I just want to be able to trust you and I want you to trust me. IT IS SO HOT!! OMG! I want to go inside, but then I will have nothing to do. I haven't decided what I am going to do when I first see you, I guess I will see what happens. I hope you will like me with my different hair and all. This was a really random letter, but I felt like writing you. U R SO AWESOME!! (even more than me)  (I know that you know, I just wanted to tell you again)  I'm so scared for school, I wander what will happen with this whole bomb threat thing. Anyways... I love you way too much and I'm sorry for putting you through this mess with Alexa. I don't know if you remember, but a while ago I told you about this song that's 'I think I fell in love with the 8th world wonder. ' well, that's how I feel about you. I love you. I'm out for now. Peace.     P.S. Be mine forever!   If you are wondering why I told you about the song, it is because it was just playing on the radio. Love yah!     3rd letter...   Carlos  I think this explains everything.  I LOVE YOU!  A love like No other    Have you ever loved someone so much it hurts to the point when you can't be away from them. Just to hear their voice you would do anything. They were the only thing you could relate to. They were the only thing you had. The are everything to you. You would give up anything and everything for them. The only way to tell them this was to write it down in away that they could maybe understand how you feel for them. Yout heart swelled for them when they were in pain. A love like no other. They turn your day around when you are sad, make you forget why you waited so long to say I love you to them. Well, I have felt a love like no other. And to lose this would be like my whole world crashing down on me. I need you now, you are the only thing I have and I can prove that to you in anyway. I listen to you, I will do what you want, I adore you, I love you, A love like no other.     4th letter...   Hey Honey-  This is the letter I wrote one day. I want you to have it. I love you so much. Talk to you soon.   My thoughts  Someone onve inspired me to write down what you feel because you never know if others know how you feel, don't take anything for granted. I am still learning to live with what I have in life, things may not be perfect, but at least I'm here. I could look at all the negative things if I wanted to, but I do that too much. Let's take a shot at the positives. I have a loving mom and dad, but sometimes don't understand the damage they can do to the people around them. I have a Grandma and a Grandpa that I know love me and I love them back. I also lost a Grandma and a Grandpa. Grandma was one of my best friends. I have my friends, that care, but sometimes can be questioned. my best friend... Abigail. what is there to say about her? love her to death, she is my bestfriend and she is always there. She won't question if she thinks Iam lying, she won't judge me, I can trust her with anything and she can do the same with me. I am always there for her. Even when we are old and gray. So many jokes we have together. Then there is my boyfriend... I love him, Like no other. my life, my everything. I will do anything for him. If it was up to me, I would spend the rest of my life with him. He makes me feel like no other. My love just over flows for him. My mom lost the love of her life and I don't know how she can deal with it. Is there a feeling more than love? Because if there is I think I feel it for him. I praise my mom for what she went through, or is going through. Have you ever been in so much pain or in such a bad mood that you couldn't stand it, but the second you talk to him or her , yout pain is gone and you are in a world alone with your one and only. And then it is up to you what you do with it, but don't waste it. Everytime I tlak to him he takes my pain away and makes me feel like the luckest girl in the world. Could I ask for anymore? No, I have it all. I love him. So you may ask why I get so upset. I really don't know why. I have my brother and sister who can annoy me sometimes (the brother). I love them both. My sister being my second mom. I have a beautiful niece, who will show any one love. Shes so innocent and you look at her smile and you look at the world from a whole diffrent angle. a more gentle and caring one. I have a good life, with just some indents in some place, but can be fixed. I will move on but maybe just a little bit slower than everyone else. If I wrote about the negatives I would be depressed and upset right now, but I am not, I am relieved and relaxed. I have a different view. I think about my family, friends and the most important to me right now my boyfriend with a smile on my face   P.S. Carlos, I love you and I'm sorry for what I did.     5th letter...  You just called me and kept saying sorry, I dont understand.... your going somewhere... with someone I dont know. God I love you. I CANT LET YOU GO I'm sorry.. I'm sorry I'm sorry...   My love a.k.a. my one and only a.k.a. my life a.k.a. my everything a.k.a. my boyfriend a.k.a.my Jesus a.k.a. my world a.k.a.  MY CARLOS!   Hey-  You just left for work and I was talking to you online, while crying. crying because I love you so so much. As I was reading my moms journal, it brought up thoughts of you. I cant put in words how I feel about you. my mom wrote that never take for granted the other person knows your feelings so write it down. I don't want you to think that I am saying I love you because I feel like it or I just wanted a boyfriend. I have never felt like this in my life and I mean it when I say that. I have felt feelings like this, bit so incredibly strong. I want you to be mines forever and ever. I want to think that you will be and I hope you are. Everytime I talk to you one the phone I always want to be in yours arms and I always want to kiss you and never let you go, but you are 50 miles away from me. Hopefully, sometime soon we will be close and I well be able to hug you or just be close to you. I don't know if you feel the same as I do, but I love you like no other and I hope that we don't lose eachother. This is probably the most random time to right this letter, but I had to tell you somehow. When I was reading my moms journal I was thinking about how much she loved my dad. He was everything to her ad now she is going through so much pain. I think about losing you and my heart automatically starts swelling. I must really be in love if I cry and write this at the same time. I could wait forever to see you and to have to as mine. I love you and here is that little sticker thing with alexa and I. UR AWESOME!! XOXOXOXOX    so we know now that these words have turned into lies. I will never love again because you have my love. I feel empty now.. with noone no one to talk to no one to be with. if you could understand what I'm going through, you have your friends and family that are going to help you with this and after we're apart you have dave to cuddle with, what do I have? I have no one. I cannot countinue living in a world filled with lies. I cannot countinue walking alone down that lonely path. I cant keep myself together anymore. You were all I ever had, please understand that this is that only way out, I cannot bare with this pain alone. Death cannot feel anyworse than what it feels now... Normally in the old I would have my hate and anger for the world to get through this, but I dont have does anymore thanks to you, you have made me a better person when I was with you. Please understand when I say this is for the best, dont be selfish and put yourself in this you will not be hurt as much as I ever was.

My friend Allison had gone first, and the teacher was explaining to us that this machine showed a person's soul.  It was kind of weird... but really cool at the same time.  Allison's frigging soul was up on the wall.  All it really looked like was this fantastic landscape, but the cool part came when the teacher asked her to think of something that made her happy.  These blue waves rolled across the landscape, and the little Allison-figure grinned.  Then she thought of something that pissed her off, and the waves turned red and angry, and the Allison-figure started to look really apocalyptic about things.  Everyone else in the class went, and finally it came to me.  They hooked me up and I looked up at the wall but all I saw was white, with a pathetic mirror image of myself standing there in the middle of all that horrible nothing.  The teacher told me to think of something that made me happy....  I waited for the blue waves to come, and I waited for my figure to smile but the waves didn't come and my figure looked around like she was waiting for something, and then suddenly my figure was smiling....  But there was nothing there.  It was all still white, and she was only smiling because the thing I thought of should of made me happy.  They unhooked me and I tried to smile and make a joke, but everyone just looked at me and they knew my little secret.  I was blank.  There was nothing there. When I woke up I felt dead.",

        "blog_text": "Dedications From 'Harvey Huang'  You probably already have your mind and heart set on something. Something I don't know about or something that nothing has nothing to do with me. I know once you set your mind and heart on something there's nothing that would change it. I respect that. I'm sure most guys do too. That's a really good thing, it means you're a strong person (Guys like that).  I'm really lucky to have you love for this long. I know I haven't been a very good or perfect boyfriend through out and all along. I fucked up in many different ways. It's too late for me to make that up. I can't just win your feeling and heart back. I'm probably consider as a pass to you huh? You do deserve so much more then me.   I know what you mean when you say that 'you wanted more in life'. This is what I was thinking about this morning. I figured it'll be easier for me to express myself to you in writing than talking to you face to face. I know you'll get very annoyed by me. So I don't wanna see you all sad and stuff. I'm gonna end it here. Love you and miss you.   There are so much things I have planned out to do with you. Getting married, having kids, little Sakdary and Little Harvey running around. Starting our family with, travel, enjoy the rest of my life with you, etc. There's nothing more I would rather do than that with YOU. I just wanna spend the rest of my life being with the one who I really love and care for. You know that I am afraid that I wouldnt have the chance and time to do that with you.   I'm sure that's what everyone wants in life. Wanting and having are two totally different things. Its nice to want things but it's not so nice not having it. Just like how I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Things tends to happen for a reason and there's nothing I can do to change it. I think I'm just being really selfish.  I'm willing to do whatever to keep you by my side. At the same time I feel you want to be doing other things. I'm keeping you from doing what you wanted to do in life. Keeping you from making friends. Its like I'm trying to lock you down with me, even tho you're not happy. Making you do things you don't wanna do. I'm keeping you away from all your dreams and goals in life.  This pass week has been the most wonderful week. It meant alot to me more than anything. Just seeing you happy. Seeing you smile!!! My heart lights up from that. It means so much to me just to see you happy on the outside. Inside I wouldnt know unless you open your heart and tell me.   I my self Sakdary, never thought that there would be another who would love me as much as Harvey does. It really means alot but what is love? Nothing last forever rite. I do believed that things happen for a reason. We've just got to find ourselves and ask our heart what is it that we want most in life. This is a total concept experience that every human being goes through.   I finally figured an answer to this situation and I tend to keep it that way. Feelings are only good when it's there. Cherish every moment when being together. have a great time and smile more often. Enjoy life as it comes because nothing last forever. I take anything that life has to offer and go with the flow. Life is too short to compormised anything if you would make plans for.   I do believe in having a future but like I said 'I'll take it as it comes. Nothing last forever'. My greatest fear of all is falling in LOVE. I am so afraid to get hurt by anyone. Life doesnt have too much great expectations. I live day by day for happiness and glad that i am still alive. I've got two favorite quote that I live up to.   'Don't cry because it's over! Smile because it happened'.  'If life gives you a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it.'",

        "blog_text": "WISDOM  I came across this speech by Alan Keyes which is more philosophical than political or religious, though it has elements of all three. It's basically a graduation address which contains good advice.  Thank you very much. Well, greetings to the class of 2000. Now, I hate to begin my talk by seeming contrary, but I always get slightly uncomfortable when folks talk about the year 2000 as the beginning of the new millennium. It's almost as if we live, we do live in the Clinton era, we all know that, and as a result every thing that we do has to be false. And therefore, among other things, we decided we'd make a false start to the new millennium. This is the 20th century, we do know that right? Now, it wouldn't be the 20th century, I've got news for you, if the year two thousand wasn't included in it. So, for all the lies that you may have been told, you are not the first class of the new millennium; you are the last class of the old one. And that bears thinking on. It bears thinking on because as we look forward into the darkness, some of us like to forget to look back and to think about where we've been, what we have come from. We're all full of thoughts of what is to be and it seems always so appropriate at graduation time just to think about the future. But the truth is, that as someone once remarked I think quite wisely, the odd thing about tomorrow is it never quite gets here, because once it gets here it's today. The opportunities such as they are are a product of what we do now and of what we have to look back upon. And at some point in your lives I think you will pass a certain line, probably most of you as graduates today have not, some of you may though, and it's that line in life where you feel the weight of your past a little bit more than you feel the lure of your future. It's an honest moment. But it's also a moment in which if you take it seriously you may cut through some of the lies that are sold to you as truth today. And in the next ten or fifteen minutes that's what I'd like to try to help you do. Because I think it's going be more useful than standing here in the usual fashion and telling you to, Go forward with high heart into the success that's inevitable given your wonderful education, and so forth and so on. You have a wonderful education, so do many people in this life. You work hard, you prepare yourself, you go out, you do your absolute best. And then you will reach a point in life, regardless of whatever else goes on, where most people most of the time have to acknowledge that all of the wonderful dreams that fill your mind today didn't quite come true. The books were not written, the films were not all made, the loves were not all enjoyed and somewhere along the way you have to deal with things you already have begun to know. The hard hours and the tough losses, the things that don't work out and the people who were here yesterday but are gone now, whose love was a certainty that failed, whose hope for you was expressed in ways that you did not understand until it was too late.    \nAnd so I want to speak a little bit, and I've been thinking about this in the course of the last several days because a friend of mine and a man I greatly, greatly admire, John Cardinal O'Connor, just rounded out his life. And he is being much praised these days, very deservedly, he looks back on a life of controversy and so forth, but if you look back on a life like that, the one thing you realize is that whatever the world may say about success or failure or greatness, I think the mark of a truly great life is a life such as his was. It was marked not just by constant successes, and constant applause and constant popularity, but by a constant sense that there were convictions that mattered, and truths that deserved allegiance and a substance to life that goes beyond what we ordinarily think of as success.   \nI remember getting a piece of advice when I started my tenure as ambassador to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. I was, at the time I began that chore, very young for the job, or at least some people would have said so. And I remember Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick who was my boss and the head of the permanent mission sitting me down when I first began, she looked at me and she said words that I have never forgotten. She said, You know, how things turn out may not depend so much on how you handle the job as how you handle yourself in the job. I think these days we put altogether too much emphasis on how you handle the job and how you get it done and what the results are and what you got paid for and what the fruits will be and what the toys are that you may have to play with at the end of the day. This may be the motivation for many. But the thing that always grieves my heart when I look out on a graduating class and think about that is that for the folks for whom that is the key motivation there will be a handful who stand at the pinnacle and enjoy the wealth and all of it, and the rest will be disappointed. Because we're not most of us going to grow up to be Bill Gates or Donald Trump. It's not in the cards and it couldn't possibly be. Some may fail, others may enjoy a modest success because that's what ordinarily happens to the mass of human beings. And as you walk on through life, if you're still measuring your life in dollar signs, if you're still trying to figure out who you are based on what you've got in the bank and what somebody else says is your success, then step by step, year by year you will go down that road of quiet desperation that the poet, wrongly I think, thought to be the inevitable lot of human kind. But it doesn't have to be that way see, if you remember that sometimes it's not just what you do in life and what you achieve in life. No. In the course of all of this you're doing more than producing a result here or there, doing a competent job, having a little fun and so forth. You are becoming someone. You are building a character. You are becoming an idea of human worth. And when all is said and done, when absolutely everything else is stripped from you, at the end of it all when you must contemplate, as we all must do, that moment when everything in this material and temporal plane that you have built and cared about and worked for will come to dust, that idea, that idea, maybe the only thing that looks as if it would survive. Not what did you do and what did you have, but who did you become and can you look back on that person with a sense of satisfaction, of joy, of pride. But you see, that's something that doesn't matter, at the end of the day, how far you go according to the measure that is used in People magazine or Forbes. No. There are folks out there, like some of the folks that contributed to your success, like some of the parents who helped to get you here, and some of the guardians, some of the aunts and uncles and friends, people nobody will ever read about in the newspaper, people no one will ever see in the history books, folks who will fade in the course of time from all of human memory except the hearts and minds of those who with their love and sacrifice and dedication, with their moments when they thought of someone else more than they thought of themselves, they fashioned hopes and dreams that are now yours, and possibilities that you may become, and then they stepped aside, content not to soar necessarily to the heights except upon the wings of those that they send forth like you, to be an offering to the future. It's much more likely you know, that the bulk of us will be like that. Much more likely that we will have to look back on lives that didn't break the surface, that didn't get more than 30 seconds much less our 15 minutes of fame. If this is what you live for you will be disappointed. But if you live instead in the hope that there will be deeds in your life when the line between right and wrong was presented to you and you decided, not because someone forced you or because someone paid you or because someone threatened you, but simply because somewhere in your heart you held true to a conviction of your spirit, you decided to do, at whatever the cost, just what you thought was right.   \nIt does not have to be a big thing, it does not have to be a thing on which the world depends, but on that moment of choice when it comes and however often it comes may very well depend what you become, and what you have to look back upon in those hours when everything else fades into insignificance and all you have left to remember are the things that stand up to the test of those standards that do not fade, those things that decide, not on our worth in the bank account but on the worth of our souls and our characters. Those things, in the end that are judged not just by the eyes of men that pass and colleagues that will disappear, but by those eyes that see with the force and power, call it by whatever name you will, that lasts through all the ages, that sees throughout all eternity and that weighs things up, not by the puny measures of our hopes, but by the true measures of what is good and right and just.   \nI think if you can stand up to that test then it's very likely that your life won't hold any real disappointment. Because I, unlike some folks, I can't stand up here and say, Well, just go out, dream as you please and everything will happen, success will be yours, all you have to do is believe in yourself! This is not true. You can believe in yourself all you like, you'll still fail some of you. But in the midst of all of that, in the midst of all the things that go wrong and don't come out right and don't quite measure up to what you had hoped would be the case as you sit here today, if you are able to believe in something more powerful, more important, more permanent, more true, more good, more just than you are, then, then you have some hope of real success. Then you have some hope that whatever the world may say, you will become that which is deathless, and which is worthy of the immortality that in the faith of many is the promise of our humanity.   \nI deeply believe that we live in times when we altogether too much forget this. our eyes blinded the sunshine of our own material success. But even for our nation you know, these times won't last. Nations have their ups and downs, their good times and bad, their travails as well as their triumphs. We meet these things with the resources of our spirit; those resources that we call upon when the bank account is empty, when the military might fails, when the depression hits, when the times are bad, when the friends desert. And yet if you have built within yourself that conviction which holds onto things that are true and sees a goodness and worth in yourself not measured by anything outside your own true heart and faithful conviction, then all those things will come and go but you will remain a faithful soul, ready to meet that destiny which is marked out for us not in the course of this little time we spend, but in the course of that eternity which though dark to us may yet be lit by the little candle of our souls.   \nSo I would like to offer to you, as I'm suppose to do I suppose, a word of encouragement. Because with the good help that you have gotten from friends and colleagues and dedicated teachers at this great institution, you lay a foundation. But then, as I'm suppose to do but as some folks forget to do these days, I'll offer you as well an admonition. An admonition is a piece of advice that comes in the form of a warning. And this one someone offered to me early in my career in government. And I thank God that I never forgot it because if I had, I would have probably lost myself long ago. We have to go out in this world, and you can sell your talent, you can sell your knowledge. You can sell your time and you can sell your labor. You will be bought and sold on the auction block of many different marketplaces where all of these things will be toted up and valued by others and you eventually too will be the judge. But if you are going to follow my advice today and remember nothing else then just remember this. There's not a single thing on offer in this all too temporary world for which you should ever sell your soul. Hold on to this. Be true to that in you which if you are willing to respect its truth, will not fail, will never desert, and will in the end, not turn into dust even when you have shuffled off this mortal coil. For I think that there is a light in us, a little spark of God's divinity. And if we husband and shelter its truth then we can make it into a light that glows beyond the edges of this time, to light a path to others, in our families, in our nation, in the world. But also to be a light whose spreading ripples in the voids of time we cannot calculate and whose ultimate fate we do not know. In some sense, I think, this is a home we can build for our humanity that lasts beyond anything else we can hope for. Be true to that little promise of it that you have and come what may, your life will be, in your own eyes and in the eyes of God, the success you hope for.  God bless you.",

A no-good bastard of a father, that’s what kind.  The funny thing is, I never cried, not once. I’m not the kind of person that cries a lot- and he wasn’t really worth any tears, to tell you the truth. Besides, if I cried, the whole world would probably be thrown into a frenzied panic- “Dear Lord!! Syd Wolfmann is crying!! The apocalypse draws near!! It’s the end of all things to come!!” It’s as if me crying is equivalent to the Four Horsemen just a-galloping in out of nowhere to announce that they’ve met their deadline, you know?  So I didn’t cry- I mean, every time he was drunk, he kicked the crap out of my 13-year-old brother and me, if anything, I should be celebrating.  The only problem is, that my mom was completely oblivious to that- she thought he was a fine, upstanding citizen. So naturally, she was devastated when he left. And then there’s the slight issue of finances, which, of course, is my reason for getting this second job at a fancy French café that’s half an hour away from my house in Hartford, near Kenelly School.  After 3 hours of face after snobby face, I was finally done with work for the day. I ran out to my car- which was actually the van belonging to my band, Asylum Street- and was surprised to see our drummer, Jade, waiting impatiently.  “FINALLY!! Come on, we gotta go to Sarah’s house!” she exclaimed.  “Jeez, I’m fine, how are you?” I replied sarcastically.  “Syd, I’m serious!! We have something really important to tell you!” she screeched.  “Alright, alright!!! And doctors say there’s no known cause for an aneurysm?” I mumbled in response.   The half hour drive back to the neighborhood that we all lived in seemed excruciatingly long- normally, Jade can’t keep a secret, but so far she hadn’t uttered a word about what the band had to tell me.  We finally reached Sarah’s house, a small yellow house on Yale Street. We ran down the stairs to the basement to see Sarah, lead guitarist, and Ashes- short for Ashley- our rhythm guitarist.  “Ok, so what is sooooo important that you had to drag me here straight from my first day at Le Café what’s-its-name, which, by the way SUCKED???” I inquired. “Well, remember when we sent that demo to SubCity Records a few months back?” began Ashes. I nodded, praying that they’d say what I thought they’d say. “Well…. WE GOT SIGNED!!” finished Sarah.  After 15 minutes or so of jumping around like the moron I am, I decided to walk home- it was only 3 streets away, on Exeter St. During the 5 minute walk, I started to think about what this could mean. SubCity wanted us to start touring the next summer, a short 4 months away. It wasn’t going to be a big tour, just the East Coast, and we’d only be stopping at really small venues, but it was a start. The best part was that we’d be touring with my other best friend’s band, Memento Mori. Both bands sent in demos to Hopeless/SubCity- SubCity is a branch of Hopeless that’s for charity bands, like us- and we both got signed. Ever since both bands started, we always said we’d both go on the same first real tour, now that was really going to happen.  There was only one problem. What about Mom and my brother, Dameon? Dameon would love to come with us. He’s always wanted to see us play shows for more that 15 kids at a time, but Mom doesn’t have a lot of love for our music, and she probably couldn’t pay all the bills- I mean, that’s why I got a second job, to help pay the bills, and if I went on tour, she’d lose all of my income. She would most definitely not want me going, and she would NOT want Dameon to go if I did.  I walked in the door of our house- it was relatively huge, considering the size of some of the surrounding houses. Dameon was sitting cross-legged on the floor, watching Rockzilla on Fuse, and mom was nowhere to be found- either she was working, or she was in her room crying. I glanced up at the clock- still some time for practicing bass before I went to bed. I ran up the stairs, making roughly the same amount of noise as a stampede of water buffalo- it’s a habit I have to make as much noise as possible for the sole purpose of annoying people. I slammed the door to my room and picked up my Mark Hoppus Fender bass from the corner of my room.   The next day I went to my job at the café at 7- I was going to work until noon, then go to my job at Hot Topic, which I’ve had for a year or so.  “Medium Soy Latte, please,” said a voice that seemed oddly familiar. I glanced up to see my best friend and the frontman of Memento Mori, Zack Broderick. “Zack!!” I exclaimed, surprised. “Yeah, thought I’d see how your new job is… is it just me, or do I not exactly seem to fit in here?” he asked, making a big point of looking around at the occupants of the café, all of whom had extremely disapproving looks on their faces- maybe it had something to do with his blue and green Mohawk, misfits shirt and plaid pants. “Yeah, it’s possible man. Listen, my break is in, like, 3 minutes, talk to you then- this little rich girl is gonna have a temper tantrum if you don’t move.” I said quietly, earning a glare from the aforementioned girl.   “So the tour starts this summer man- it’s finally happening,” said Zack.  “Yeah, it’s crazy, man. I never thought we’d get signed this early.”  “Seriously, me too. It’s insane, we’re going to be touring and you’ll be just barely 18. But… what about your mom, Joey said she’s depending on you to make money, and you can’t exactly work when you’re on tour?” he asked, mentioning my cousin, Joey, who played drums for Memento. “Yeah, I haven’t exactly told her yet, but I will… I just have to wait until I’ve saved up some money for her to have while I’m gone.” “Man, you gotta tell her soon- otherwise you’re gonna end up telling her the night before we leave, and she’ll have found out by then.” “I know, I know… I’m working on it, man… I just gotta wait a little longer, if I tell her too early, she’ll find a way to keep me from going.”  Well, even though I promised Zack I’d tell mom, weeks went by, until it was only a month before we started touring. I walked into the house, fresh from another day at Le Café de Torture, to see the house seemingly empty with all the lights off.  “I heard something very interesting today, Sydney.” Came my mother’s voice from the living room. Her voice no longer had the scratchy tone of someone who had been crying for hours on end, the tone that I was so used to. Now it was cold and even, and downright scary. Whenever my father had used that tone with me, I had been scared out of my Doc Martens. But not this time, I was sick of being pushed around by other people.  “What was that?” I responded in an equally cold tone.   “Oh, I think you already know exactly what.” She was going to make this as difficult as possible, wasn’t she?   “Let’s pretend I don’t, shall we?”  “Alright then, yes, let’s.” she agreed. “I heard that you’re planning on leaving on tour with your little friends.”  “Ding ding ding, we have a winner!!” I said in a sarcastically animated voice. “Your prize is $10,000 worth of ‘big whoop’ and a lifetime supply of ‘I don’t care’!!!”  “I forbid it.” She said simply.  “Too late, we’re leaving in less than a month.” I said indifferently.  “I should have known.” She sneered, her voice layered with icy contempt and spite. “I should have known. First you drove your father out, now you yourself are leaving! It was so clear- ever since you started that band of yours—'  she spat out the word ‘band’ as if it left a bad taste in her mouth “- it should have made perfect sense. All those years, I prayed that it was a phase, that you’d grow out of it and become a respectable young lady, but it doesn’t seem to matter, you still managed to become a bass guitar playing little bitch, become a disgrace to this family! How dare you? How dare you leave This Family?! Do you know what I thought when I first found out? Do you?! I thought about how much better off the world would be without you, how much better off I’d be if you were gone! Do you hear me, I wish you would die!”  She continued to scream and rant, but it was all meaningless noise. The last 5 words that registered in my mind kept echoing back to me- “I wish you would die…. I wish you would die…” These are undoubtedly the 5 most powerful words in the world.  I was vaguely aware of stumbling up the stairs and into my room, slamming the door, and sliding down on the floor. My thoughts were a blur. Now I knew what it was like to be Justin Sane, the bass player that swallowed a bottle of cough syrup, or Sid Vicious, who overdosed on heroin on purpose, or the kid at school who put a bullet in his brain. It doesn’t take insanity; it just takes 5 words- “I wish you would die”. I stood up shakily and walked over to the desk where I kept all of my drawing materials, including the knife I used to sharpen my drawing pencils. I picked it up and looked at the blade, smeared with graphite. No matter how many times I cleaned it, that knife was still always covered in smudges and stains of graphite. If the blood loss didn’t kill me, then infection certainly would, this blade was anything but sterile.    I stretched out on the floor, staring up at the ceiling. I started to lift up the knife, but then I heard a noise downstairs. I realized it was Dameon coming home from his friend’s house. I heard him turn on the stereo and then heard Pantera blasting through the speakers.  WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING??????!!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?  I sat up and threw the knife across the room. Mom was one person. Ashes, Jade, Sarah, Dameon, Zack, everyone else…. They were a lot of people. And the people that I’d make happy, there were only a few of them. The people that would mourn for me- there were just as many, if not more. I couldn’t let them down… and more importantly, I couldn’t let myself down by doing this. I couldn’t let one person’s words kill me, no matter how powerful those words were. It’s that simple.  I picked up a notebook and pen from my nightstand and started writing. If lyric writing had helped me through shit before, how come it couldn’t help me now? I scribbled, crossed out, and scribbled some more, until finally, several hours later, I had something that sounded decent. Then I put my notebook away and went to bed- I had to work and practice with the band the next day, and I needed sleep more now than ever.  The next day, after work, the band came over to practice. We played all our old songs first, taking up about an hour, then I told them I had some new material to show them. “Alright, then lets hear it!” said Jade. “Ok, I just wrote it last night- just bass and lyrics, I started on some guitar, but I needed you guys to help with that, I mean, you’ll be playing it- I didn’t even start on drums.” I played the song I had written the night before for them. When I was done, 6 minutes later, they were staring at me in awe.   “Sydney, I need to talk to you.” Said my mom as I walked up the stairs from my basement, where we’d been rehearsing. I looked over at her, not quite ready to talk to her. “I… I lost my job. They said I was out too often, ever since your father left.” She told me before running to her room and slamming the door, just as I had so many times.  Now I was faced with a new dilemma- if Mom still had her job, she could at least support herself if I took Dameon with me on tour, but now there was no way in hell. I picked up the phone and dialed my aunt- mom’s sister’s- number. I needed help, we needed help. There was no way we could survive without mom working.  “Hello?” said a voice at the other end. “Hey Aunt Katey…” I said. “Syd, what’s wrong?” she asked. “Mom lost her job.” I said flatly. “And I don’t see how I can tour next month if she’s not working, she can’t support herself, even if Dameon comes with me.” “Well, then it’s final. Your mother is coming to stay with me.” She said matter-of-factly.  “Huh? Are you serious?” I asked, suddenly realizing that there was some hope. “Yes, of course. If Dameon wants to go with you, then by all means, but if he doesn’t, he’s welcome to stay as well. “But… I mean, wouldn’t it be imposing…?” “Of course not, you’re my family too! Look, even if you stay, they’ll be out on the streets in a matter of months. If your mother stays here, it gives her some time to get back on her feet without having to worry about the mortgage. Give her some time to cool down, then tell her tomorrow.” She said. “Thanks!! Bye!” I replied.   The next day, we had another practice at my house, to finish writing the song. Jade had come up with a drum solo, and Ashes and Sarah had come up with some guitar.  We spent 2 hours putting everything together, then when we finally got it right, we decided to run through it one more time.  “Suffocation.  Your words force the air from my lungs, Air that now tastes cold and dead As images of days we had Run slowly through my head.” At first the vocals were soft and even, no signs of any screaming. But it slowly got louder and louder through the next few verses, until it was my signature shrieks and howls.  “Suddenly I can breathe again But the air still tastes dead to my lungs Now I can safely say  That my time is done…”  At this point, Jade flew into an angry drum solo, at least a minute long, followed by Sarah’s guitar solo, which started out as angrily as Jade’s drums, but faded into soft, mournful melodies. After the solos, I sang the last lines of the song, in the same tone as the opening lines:  “To those that I love, The ones I leave behind Please do not cry And please don’t try to save me tonight I still love you This is goodbye….” I glanced up, thinking I heard someone running away quickly, but upon seeing no one, I decided it was nothing. Still, I could have sworn I heard something…  We packed up and I went to find Mom and tell her what Aunt Katey said. I found her sitting in the living room. “Mom, you’re gonna stay with Aunt Katey while I’m on tour.” I said flatly. “I suppose Dameon will be going with you?” she asked. Her voice wasn’t the scratchy, crackly tone, but it wasn’t the cold, spiteful one either- she sounded resigned to the fact that I would go no matter what, and Dameon would be going too. “If he wants to. Sorry, but it’s for the best…” I trailed off. “I know.” I walked back downstairs to pack up my bass, thinking “And so it begins…”   From the Asylum Street online tour journal: We’ve been on tour for 2 weeks now- it’s so cool! We’ve been getting on each others nerves occasionally, but it’s no big deal- we’re finally living out our dreams, and it’s the greatest thing- well, ever. Dameon’s having fun, just like everyone else- he may be only 13, but he fits in really well. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from touring- and getting ready for the tour- is that not everything is as simple as we’d like it to be- JUST DEAL WITH IT. Remember to catch us when we’re in town- that is, if you live on the east coast. Check out the Tour Dates for more info.  Love, Peace, Unity, Syd   Hope you liked it. It was fun writing it.

I, as all Americans, feel saddened and enraged, but simultaneously guilty for having these feelings since neither I nor any of my closest friends and family members did not perish in these incidents.  I have lived, or in the case of northern Virginia: still live, in all of the areas that were unfortunately ravaged, and continue to have ties with their residents.

Like a war with uneven odds, the atmosphere that enters my being will battle and triumph over evil within. Every organ, muscle and bone will swell and grow strong from the purity. My ears will grow clear and let me hear all the sounds unknown to me now. The trees will whisper age old secrets, teach me forgotten songs of joy and impart wisdom to be known by me alone. My feet and hands will know the feel of the earth; be intimate with soil; and know the strength and solidity that comes from the union of infinite particles. My cheeks will sigh at the caress of the breeze  as it gently travels up and across the mountain. My face will feel the warmth of the sun's rays slipping past the canopy of the trees, and the sudden chilling as the trees shift their great arms and defy the sun to overheat their sheltered lair. My eyes will welcome the stars on a crisp, cloudless night, as a wanderer come upon an oasis. I will lay on the earth, with my trees nearby, and endlessly stare at the stars, until my mind is filled with the magnitude of the universe, and my spirit begins to expand and spin. And every morning, whether the sun invites me to play, or the rain takes its cleansing turn, I will breathe in my mountain and thank God for finally letting me live.",

        "blog_text": "Can it really be sixty-two years ago that I first saw you?  It is truly a lifetime, I know. But as I gaze into your eyes now, it seems like only yesterday that I first saw you, in that small cafe in Hanover Square.  From the moment I saw you smile, as you opened the door for that young mother and her newborn baby. I knew. I knew that I wanted to share the rest of my life with you.   I still think of how foolish I must have looked, as I gazed at you, that first time. I remember watching you intently, as you took off your hat and loosely shook your short dark hair with your fingers. I felt myself becoming immersed in your every detail, as you placed your hat on the table and cupped your hands around the hot cup of tea, gently blowing the steam away with your pouted lips.  From that moment, everything seemed to make perfect sense to me. The people in the cafe and the busy street outside all disappeared into a hazy blur. All I could see was you.  All through my life I have relived that very first day. Many, many times I have sat and thought about that the first day, and how for a few fleeting moments I am there, feeling again what is like to know true love for the very first time. It pleases me that I can still have those feelings now after all those years, and I know I will always have them to comfort me.  Not even as I shook and trembled uncontrollably in the trenches, did I forget your face. I would sit huddled into the wet mud, terrified, as the hails of bullets and mortars crashed down around me. I would clutch my rifle tightly to my heart, and think again of that very first day we met. I would cry out in fear, as the noise of war beat down around me. But, as I thought of you and saw you smiling back at me, everything around me would be become silent, and I would be with you again for a few precious moments, far from the death and destruction. It would not be until I opened my eyes once again, that I would see and hear the carnage of the war around me.  I cannot tell you how strong my love for you was back then, when I returned to you on leave in the September, feeling battered, bruised and fragile. We held each other so tight I thought we would burst. I asked you to marry me the very same day and I whooped with joy when you looked deep into my eyes and said 'yes' to being my bride.  I'm looking at our wedding photo now, the one on our dressing table, next to your jewellery box. I think of how young and innocent we were back then. I remember being on the church steps grinning like a Cheshire cat, when you said how dashing and handsome I looked in my uniform. The photo is old and faded now, but when I look at it, I only see the bright vibrant colors of our youth. I can still remember every detail of the pretty wedding dress your mother made for you, with its fine delicate lace and pretty pearls. If I concentrate hard enough, I can smell the sweetness of your wedding bouquet as you held it so proudly for everyone to see.  I remember being so over enjoyed, when a year later, you gently held my hand to your waist and whispered in my ear that we were going to be a family.  I know both our children love you dearly; they are outside the door now, waiting.  Do you remember how I panicked like a mad man when Jonathon was born? I can still picture you laughing and smiling at me now, as I clumsily held him for the very first time in my arms. I watched as your laughter faded into tears, as I stared at him and cried my own tears of joy.  Sarah and Tom arrived this morning with little Tessie. Can you remember how we both hugged each other tightly when we saw our tiny granddaughter for the first time? I cant believe she will be eight next month. I am trying not to cry, my love, as I tell you how beautiful she looks today in her pretty dress and red shiny shoes, she reminds me so much of you that first day we met. She has her hair cut short now, just like yours was all those years ago. When I met her at the door her smile wrapped around me like a warm glove, just like yours used to do, my darling.   I know you are tired, my dear, and I must let you go. But I love you so much it hurts to do so.  As we grew old together, I would tease you that you had not changed since we first met. But it is true, my darling. I do not see the wrinkles and grey hair that other people see. When I look at you now, I only see your sweet tender lips and youthful sparkling eyes as we sat and had out first picnic next to that small stream, and chased each other around that big old oak tree. I remember wishing those first few days together would last forever. Do you remember how exciting and wonderful those days were?  I must go now, my darling. Our children are waiting outside. They want to say goodbye to you.  I wipe the tears away from my eyes and bend my frail old legs down to the floor, so that I can kneel beside you. I lean close to you and take hold of your hand and kiss your tender lips for the very last time.  Sleep peacefully my dear.  I am sad that you had to leave me, but please dont worry. I am content, knowing I will be with you soon. I am too old and too empty now to live much longer without you.  I know it wont be long before we meet again in that small cafe in Hanover Square.   Goodbye, my darling wife.     I am really moved",

        "blog_text": "I finally realize how painful love can be. How things said in the past, actions taken in the past, can all be forgotten in a matter of weeks or months. Today I realize that what I had was an illusion of things the way I would have liked them to be. Life is not perfect but you can't help but wish for all the perfect things to happen at the right times. Sometimes I am amazed at how much hurt and pain a human heart can endure. It will take me time, to be totally over him. In time I hope we can be friends. But today, right now, I cannot spend a minute thinking of him without breaking down in tears. To have someone tell you, once upon a time, that you were their only love, that you were the only person they could see lying next to them in the morning, that you were gonna be the mother of their children, that you were gonna grow old together and sit next to each other on some bench in a park all wrinkled and toothless, and now to have to hear that he has found someone so quick to replace me hurts beyond words. Ive loved him before I even knew it was love and Ive been there for him through everything. We've gone through so much and we survived so much. And now its all gone. After giving your all to someone for 6 years and then being told that they aren't sure if you are the one, can make any sane person go crazy. All I ever wanted was his love. I never was a demanding girlfriend. I never asked for things or acted in any way that would have made him doubt my love this much. Could it have been fear of commitment? I will never know. This new woman in his life, the things he says about her, just kills me. To say that she is almost like me and that he doesn't want to risk losing her to give me time to think, all that, makes me wonder if the love he proclaimed for me was ever real. It is so scary to be lonely that it is so unbearable? I don't agree, I'm here, alone, and I'm surviving and I'm not looking for the nearest hunk to replace any available spots in my life, why would I want to do that, he took everything I had, I have nothing left to give anyone anymore. He says he will never let her go, why didn't he think like that when we were together? He says he hopes she teaches him how to love, why does he think that when all I ever did was love him with every inch of my soul. I've always believed that to love means to never give up, but today I do not carry the same beliefs anymore, today everything has changed, today I will not look back and cry anymore, Enough already, I'm moving on with no regrets, because it was never meant to be, he would never have made me happy, and vice versa. Today I wish I could also say that I hope he finds what he's looking for but all I have for him today is resentment and hate, but I know, one day, I will be in that place and I will wish those things for him, but today, my hurt overshadows all that. You were my first love, and to date, my only love, I will love no other like I loved you, our love was young and immature, reckless and exciting, but I wish it had grown like we did, and sustained us both, but it didn't and what is left are silent unspeakable memories to be shared with no one, not even you, as I can't have you in my life anymore, cause you have her, and I can't bear to see your love for her unfold the way it should have for me, we loved with a love that was more than us, but somewhere along the way, life consumed us and destroyed our love, we were both fooled by the fact that real love stories never have endings, but maybe this wasn't real love, but having, wherever you are, I hope you know that it felt real to me. Today I am moving on, and I will never shed one more tear for you, I cried you an ocean of tears and it's time I get my life back on track. You have wronged me in more ways than one, and I have done the same, we are both paying for our mistakes, but who can blame us, a love that young is bound to face hurdles. I've closed the doors leading to my heart thinking you were doing the same, but you haven't and now it's time for me to open mine, to allow someone a chance to show me that love doesn't have to be painful. In some weird way, whatever happened today, happened for the best, it has pushed us to close the doors leading to each other and to open doors to others. I am worth so much more than you have shown me and I will be so much more than I have ever dreamed possible. I deserve so much more and it is TIME. The magic of first love is our ignorance that it can never end. Some people come into our lives and quickly go. Some people move our souls to dance. They awaken us to new understanding with the passing whisper of their wisdom. Some people make the sky more beautiful to gaze upon. They stay in our lives for awhile, leave footprints on our hearts, and we are never ever the same.",

Our session is being recorded by The Observer.  I am sitting in a small room, pink walls, two chairs sparse but warm. I am in a t-shirt and sweatpants with big holes in them. I’m slouching on the chair, arms and legs crossed, the lines on my face turned into a deep scowl. The door is open. Rhonda walks in, big fresh faced smile, taking off her coat and scarf as she enters the room, putting down her purse as she shuts the door.  Rhonda: “Good evening Carolyn.” I give a stiff nod. Rhonda pulls the chair closer to me, sits down, leans forward, folds her hands in her lap and looks directly into my eyes. Rhonda: “So tell me what’s up.” Carolyn: “I don’t know. I’ve lost myself. I’ve lost perspective. Any perspective I once had I now feel was just a cheap façade to keep me from seeing myself for the stupid shit that I am.” Rhonda: “Uh-huh. I want you to tell me what emotions you are experiencing. What are your feelings? Can you identify them?” Carolyn: “Uhm, I think so. I can try. I feel very, very, very irritated. I feel hurt, I feel deceived. I feel inferior and deeply inadequate.” Rhonda: “Good. Now I want you to tell me what you are thinking. What are the thoughts connected to these feelings?” Carolyn: “Hmmm. I think that I am not a rational thinker, that I have very little intellectual ability. Because of this, I have little to nothing to offer the world.” Rhonda: “Good, I’m glad you were able to connect your feelings of inadequacy with your thoughts of not contributing to the world. Now I’m going to ask you some questions, and I’d like you to answer them as honestly as possible. Why did you first choose to become a vegetarian?” Carolyn: “I chose to become a vegetarian because I feel a connection with animals. I think we share many characteristics that are widely thought of as uniquely human. Animals have the capacity to sense, to feel emotions, to connect with other beings. Animals have great capacity for compassion. It is through careful observation of their actions that their autonomy and uniqueness are revealed. I could not rationalize exploiting animals, or condoning the cruelty and disregard that so many humans have for them. I would never, ever wish harm done upon them, as I would never wish harm done upon humans. Few humans acknowledge, cherish and respect life, as I feel it should be acknowledged, cherished and respected.” Rhonda is sitting back in her chair, her legs crossed, a sly smile forming on her countenance. Rhonda: “I would like you to consider what this reveals about you as a person.” Carolyn: “Hmmm. I don’t know. I’m a sentimental idiot?” Rhonda: “No. Carolyn, you make decisions based on YOUR experience of the world. Based on the decisions you’ve made, do you think you are a compassionate person?” Carolyn: “Ahm…well….” Rhonda: “Do you think you are being true to yourself by asserting your beliefs, your values, by choosing to be a vegan?” Carolyn: “Well, I guess so, but…” Rhonda: “Okay. Do you think that compassion is the language of the heart?” Carolyn: “Yes.” Rhonda: “Do you see any value in compassion as a contribution to the world?” Carolyn: “Yes.” Rhonda: “Do you think you contribute to the world by being an intuitive thinker? By having the rare and precious ability to accept and express compassion?” Carolyn: “um…” Rhonda: “Answer from your heart.” Carolyn: “Yes.” Rhonda: “Now, I’m going to ask you some questions, and I want you to continue to seek the answers in your heart. Are you stupid?” Carolyn: “No.” Rhonda: “Do you have something to contribute to the world?” Carolyn: “Yes.” Rhonda: “Are you able to contribute by being true to yourself—by being compassionate?” Carolyn: “Yes.”",

I have little bits of all of my friends burned into my mind. Things that I couldn't forget even if I wanted to.

Truth is I am. Most of the time. But I have honestly worked very hard for it.   I had a good childhood. I had a good teenagehood. As a child I was skinny, but as a teenager I was not. But I was not really fat, though I had discovered comfort food. However, because I was dancing at the time (I was going to ballet classes since I was 4) I was what someone could call 'pleasantly rounded'.  I had an accident when I was 18 and I had to stay in bed for months and months. I started gaining weight. To cut the long story short, I have gained and lost the same 30 to 50 kilos 3 times in my life. The last time I was really slim was 1997, the year I got married. I was 67 kgs, and I didn't look skinny, but oh so pleasantly rounded again. I started gaining weight in 2000. Slowly at first. A couple of kilos, then 4, then I started moving a little, and then I met a new girlfriend. She was an homosexual woman. We instantly clicked and became best friends. My husband was working a lot at the time. He would leave home at 6 am and come back at 10 in the evening, eat, and sleep. He was relieved I had found a new girlfriend to keep me entertained. I grew fonder and fonder of her.    Again, to cut the long story short, I fell in love with her. It was so strange to me, because I had never feelings for women. Nor have I ever had again after her. We became a couple. I left home, moved in with her, spend 2 wonderful months together, and then things became ugly. With her, and with my family. Although I had asked for a divorce, my husband asked me to give us another try. So I went back home, with my self esteem down the drain, my heart broken, my guilt built to its highest levels, and tons of disgust for myself.  I returned to the low feelings I had at childhood. Only I never realised them back then. I was the first child in my family. I have had a great childhood from two loving parents that did the best they could. I was the queen of the world till my little bro came. Then I went to school. I was such a great student, that I was once again the queen and I started blooming! In the meantime, I made peace inside me with my brother's existence, and realised that I loved him so much. (My brother is now my best friend and has honoured me with a wonderful niece and a gorgeous nephew :)  Before he went to school all family friends and relatives had been telling him that he better be as good as I was when he starts school. So he suddenly became dyslectic. He was repeating letters or whole syllables when talking. My parents took him to a child therapist and he told them that they should make him feel special by turning all their attention to him. He even called me for a session and told me that my parents love me too much and that aint too nice for my little brother, so although they will go on loving me, they should not show it to me as much, so that my brother will be cured. I was six, and my mom still is afraid to give me his address cos she knows I WILL go bomb his place!!!  Anyway, apparently back then I had formed a belief. When I was wonderful and my parents loved and admired me, when I was doing wonderfully at school and my teachers and all appraised me, I was harming my brother, resulting in making my parents sad. In fewer words. My being wonderful should be camouflaged cos it had a bad effect on people I loved.   So when I returned home to my husband, I felt I was such a bad person, that I went into a depression, that would only go away with food. I would go to work, return, and eat, and eat, and eat. At the end of this circle, I weighted at 130 kilos. I had gain 60 kilos in about a year.   Luckily, in the middle of this period, I begun to see a Somatic Phychotherapist. Every day when I wake up, I remind myself to build this man a statue!  I went deep inside me. After tons of garbage I slowly begun to like what I saw. I came into peace with the forever existing issues between mothers and daughters and fathers and daughters and sisters and brothers. I begun to form a very close relationship with my body. I begun to learn how to stop thinking and begin feeling. My entire world changed. My priorities in life changed. I used to believe that work came first, then me, then the rest. Now, my husband, family, friends and myself come first. Work is just the means to pay the bills and the occasional shopping spree. As a young woman, I had developed a concrete theory about not wanting to have children. Ever. I actually believed that noone should have, till we run out of orphans in this world. See, I had to be nice and think globally so that people wouldn't think I am a selfish bitch who wants to do as she wants when she wants and that's why she didn't want to have kids. Big fat bullshit. I was scared to death. I was feeling incompetent. I was feeling unstable. And I was a selfish bitch!   (I am still spending 50 minutes a week in my therapist's place. I feel I still have a long way to go. I want to be as clean as possible from the past before I become a mother. I suspect that the remaining of the road will be more roses than thorns. We will see...)  Through all this roughness, my wonderful husband stood by my side. I was fat and ugly and he would tell me how sexy my ass was. I would get mad at him and scream and yell and call him a liar. He meant it. I am blessed with a man who loved me equally fat or thin, nice or disgusting. Now I can appreciate it. Before I was not able to really admit anything as deeply nice as this.  Anyway, somewhere in 2001 I saw a dietician. Ever since, I have been loosing weight. I have tried different metthods because I like diversity and get easily bored. From that strict dietician, I moved to WW and in March to a holistic doctor. Currently I am following his basic directions and sort of maintaining, but I am seriously considering WW again, because I need some 'fun discipline' and toying with the points was that for me. I have periods of non dieting and regaining some back, I have periods of brilliantly dieting and dropping the kilos like a star, and I have periods of learning to maintain.  I fell in love with my husband all over again - we first got together when I was 20 years old - and we are both working on our marriage every single day. We learned that a marriage is a full time job and needs constant commitment. We learned it the hard way and we appreciate it more cos of that. In September my business partner will give birth to her son and after October 10, when I finish with this big congress I am organising, we will start trying to have our baby.  If someone told me 3 years ago that on June 25 2004 I would feel the way I feel, I would believe the things I believe, and that I would be who I am, I would have laughed at their face. Hard. Unkindly.   I am no more afraid or ashamed to feel proud of myself about my achievements. I am no longer feeling guilty for my doings. I honestly regreted what I had to regret. I sincerely apologised to whom I needed to apologised. I am no longer avoiding compliments. I know I will loose the remaining 20 something kilos. In 6 months or 16. I don't care. I know for sure that I will not gain the 40 I lost through out these 3 years. NEVER AGAIN!  I also know, and I let you know too, so you won't form the wrong impression for me, that I am weak. I have ups and downs. I have wonderful days and mediocre days and bad days too. I have mornings that I wake up and feel refreshed and have a great work out on the treadmill, and a fantastic day at work, and eat brilliantly, and have extrasupergreat sex and feel that on top of the world and know, really know that there is nothing better in life than life itself! And then, I have a long working week with tons of crisis and fights with my business partner, and I want to kill my assistant, and eat poorly, and miss a couple of days on the treadmill and feel bad and disappointed of myself, and my husband comes home late from work and I whine and get grumpy and refuse his hugs because all I want is to be left alone and whine and whine and whine. After all I have had 32 years to built my world, and less than 3 to 'renovate', so I still have to get used to the newly formed habits of living. But I know, and you should also know, that I am not giving up on me. Because I have learned, the hard way again, that giving up on me, is giving up on the gift of life. And this is an insult. And of all the things I have done in life, insulting life is something I shall never do again.  P.S. Through the last couple of years or less, I have been reading so many diet blogs. To some of these wonderful women out here, I have sent emails with parts of my 'how I became an elephant' story. This is almost the whole thing. Almost. Thank you for taking the time to read it.",

        "blog_text": "Mrs. Reagan, Patti, Michael and Ron, members of the Reagan family, distinguished guests, including our presidents and first ladies, Reverend Danforth, fellow citizens, we lost Ronald Reagan only days ago but we have missed him for a long time.  We have missed his kindly presence, that reassuring voice and the happy ending we had wished for him.   It has been 10 years since he said his own farewell, yet it is still very sad and hard to let him go.   Ronald Reagan belongs to the ages now, but we preferred it when he belonged to us.   In a life of good fortune, he valued above all the gracious gift of his wife, Nancy.  During his career, Ronald Reagan passed through a thousand crowded places, but there was only one person, he said, who could make him lonely by just leaving the room.   America honors you, Nancy, for the loyalty and love you gave this man on a wonderful journey and to that journey's end.   Today, our whole nation grieves with you and your family.   When the sun sets tonight off the coast of California and we lay to rest our 40th president, a great American story will close.   The second son of Nell and Jack Reagan first knew the world as a place of open plains, quiet streets, gas-lit rooms and carriages drawn by horse.   If you could go back to the Dixon, Illinois, of 1922, you'd find a boy of 11 reading adventure stories at the public library or running with his brother Neil along Rock River, and coming home to a little house on Hennepin Avenue.   That town was the kind of place he remembered where you prayed side by side with your neighbors.  And if things were going wrong for them, you prayed for them and knew they'd pray for you if things went wrong for you.   The Reagan family would see its share of hardship, struggle and uncertainty.   And out of that circumstance came a young man of steadiness, calm and a cheerful confidence that life would bring good things.   The qualities all of us have seen in Ronald Reagan were first spotted 70 and 80 years ago.  As the lifeguard in Lowell Park, he was the protector, keeping an eye out for trouble.   As a sports announcer on the radio, he was the friendly voice that made you see the game as he did.   As an actor he was the handsome all-American good guy, which in his case required knowing his lines and being himself.   Along the way certain convictions were formed and fixed in  he should strive to know and do the will of God.  He believed that the gentleman always does the kindest thing.  He believed that people were basically good and had the right to be free.  He believed that bigotry and prejudice were the worst things a person could be guilty of.  He believed in the golden rule and in the power of prayer. He believed that America was not just a place in the world, but the hope of the world.   And he believed in taking a break now and then, because, as we said, there's nothing better for the inside of a man than the outside of a horse.   Ronald Reagan spent decades in the film industry and in politics, fields known on occasion to change a man.  But not this man.  From Dixon to Des Moines to Hollywood to Sacramento to Washington, D.C., all who met him remembered the same sincere, honest, upright fellow.   Ronald Reagan's deepest beliefs never had much to do with fashion or convenience.  His convictions were always politely stated, affably argued, and as firm and straight as the columns of this cathedral.   There came a point in Ronald Reagan's film career when people started seeing a future beyond the movies.  The actor Robert Cummings recalled one occasion.   'I was sitting around the set with all these people and we were listening to Ronnie, quite absorbed.  I said, 'Ron, have you ever considered some day becoming president?'   'He said, 'President of what?'   ''President of the United States,' I said.   'And he said, 'What's the matter?  Don't you like my acting either?''   The clarity and intensity of Ronald Reagan's convictions led to speaking engagements around the country, and a new following he did not seek or expect.   He often began his speeches by saying, 'I'm going to talk about controversial things.'  And then he spoke of communist rulers as slave masters, of a government in Washington that had far overstepped its proper limits, of a time for choosing that was drawing near.   In the space of a few years, he took ideas and principles that were mainly found in journals and books and turned them into a broad, hopeful movement ready to govern.   As soon as Ronald Reagan became California's governor, observers saw a star in the west, tanned, well-tailored, in command and on his way.  In the 1960s his friend Bill Buckley wrote, 'Reagan is indisputably a part of America and he may become a part of American history.'   Ronald Reagan's moment arrived in 1980.  He came out ahead of some very good men, including one from Plains and one from Houston. What followed was one of the decisive decades of the century as the convictions that shaped the president began to shape the times.   He came to office with great hopes for America.  And more than hopes.  Like the president he had revered and once saw in person, Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan matched an optimistic temperament with bold, persistent action.   President Reagan was optimistic about the great promise of economic reform, and he acted to restore the rewards and spirit of enterprise.  He was optimistic that a strong America could advance the peace, and he acted to build the strength that mission required.   He was optimistic that liberty would thrive wherever it was planted, and he acted to defend liberty wherever it was threatened.   And Ronald Reagan believed in the power of truth in the conduct of world affairs.  When he saw evil camped across the horizon he called that evil by its name.   There were no doubters in the prisons and gulags, where dissidents spread the news, tapping to each other in code what the American president had dared to say.  There were no doubters in the shipyards and churches and secret labor meetings where brave men and women began to hear the creaking and rumbling of a collapsing empire. And there were no doubters among those who swung hammers at the hated wall that the first and hardest blow had been struck by President Ronald Reagan.   The ideology he opposed throughout his political life insisted that history was moved by impersonal tides and unalterable fates. Ronald Reagan believed instead in the courage and triumph of free men and we believe it all the more because we saw that courage in him.   As he showed what a president should be, he also showed us what a man should be.   Ronald Reagan carried himself, even in the most powerful office, with the decency and attention to small kindnesses that also define a good life.   He was a courtly, gentle and considerate man, never known to slight or embarrass others.   Many people across the country cherish letters he wrote in his own hand to family members on important occasions, to old friends dealing with sickness and loss, to strangers with questions about his days in Hollywood.   A boy once wrote to him requesting federal assistance to help clean up his bedroom.   The president replied that, 'Unfortunately, funds are dangerously low.'   He continued, 'I'm sure your mother was fully justified in proclaiming your room a disaster...   '... therefore you are in an excellent position to launch another volunteer program in our nation.   'Congratulations.'   See, our 40th president wore his title lightly, and it fit like a white Stetson.   In the end, through his belief in our country and his love for our country, he became an enduring symbol of our country.   We think of the steady stride, that tilt of the head and snap of the salute, the big screen smile, and the glint in his Irish eyes when a story came to mind.   We think of a man advancing in years with the sweetness and sincerity of a scout saying the pledge.  We think of that grave expression that sometimes came over his face, the seriousness of a man angered by injustice and frightened by nothing.   We know, as he always said, that America's best days are ahead of us.  But with Ronald Reagan's passing, some very fine days are behind us.  And that is worth our tears.   Americans saw death approach Ronald Reagan twice in a moment of violence and then in the years of departing light.  He met both with courage and grace.  In these trials, he showed how a man so enchanted by life can be at peace with life's end.   And where does that strength come from?  Where is that courage learned?  It is the faith of a boy who read the Bible with his mom. It is the faith of a man lying in an operating room who prayed for the one who shot him before he prayed for himself.  It is the faith of a man with a fearful illness who waited on the Lord to call him home.   Now death has done all that death can do, and as Ronald Wilson Reagan goes his way, we are left with the joyful hope he shared.   In his last years he saw through a glass darkly.  Now he sees his savior face to face.   And we look for that fine day when we will see him again, all weariness gone, clear of mind, strong and sure and smiling again, and the sorrow of this parting gone forever.   May God bless Ronald Reagan and the country he loved.",

Words that convey what I think of the world, what I believe to be true about certain people and the way I see others! And then the most overwhelming image came to my mind... so I wrote this:    I stare in awe as lightning strikes and  I see the beginnings of rain in a single crystalline droplet,  quick silver in the shadowy moonlight.  Such beauty!  Such sweet despair! What ecstasy it is to see those silver drops glimmering in the night.  Every drop a shimmering hope lost,  a dream lost to the wind. And yet rain continues to fall  every drop sparkling in the waning light.  Many hopes dashed lost to the world.  Yet on it comes, ceaselessly.  All those tears, dreams that have ceased to live,  shall my dreams be next to fall from the sky,  will my hopes be dashed, I cry. As the droplets of liquid crystal fall from the heavens all I can do is cry.  For these glimmering droplets are reflections of my sorrow.  These single droplets are all that I have.  They are beauty, life, spirit and they are all within me.  Yet those droplets are yet single, alone, as I am.  Alone in this pain filled world.  Those droplets are my only relief, my only escape from this hapless world.  I am tired of this consuming pain, this sickening sorrow.  Yet what can be done?  Just as the rain continues to fall down upon me I shall go on.  Just as the sun continues to rise, I will endure the lies.  Life has never been easy. Yet when shall this pain end?  When shall this abysmal darkness cease?      And I must be feeling inspired tonight because as I was driving home, frases and words were being played in my mind for this next piece:    When my silence is loud Lost in the roar of ocean waves It is only that I am listening  Following the tracks of echoes  That have led me to this shore  Swirling within the mist of me Are mysteries that fail to submit To the limitations of mere language Though their defiance is perplexing It is not without resolution As I redirect my focus within  With eyes closed and lips sealed My unfathomable depths  Are projected above the waves So you may see what I feel What my voice fails to convey The true colors of my dreams Splashed upon the dawn of night     But that's it for tonight folks. To be honest, I don't want to even touch upon what I'm feeling right now. I need to ignore my emotions for a while because otherwise they'll boil over and all hell will break loose.

I had the most bizarre dream last night.  Seemed as if it took 12 hours to pass, and it was ripe with symbolism.  A full description of the dream is at the end of this entry.    Right now I'm listening to the Smashing Pumpkins, a band I can now respect and appreciate for what they are.  This comes from a long attachment to a girl, and her unhealthy obsession with the band.  She dumped me about what must be a month now.  I know I should be mature, and it sounds stupid to just say 'she was the one' but we were supposed to marry.  We lost our virginity to each other (at least I lost mine to her).  We worked through all the tough things a couple could go through, and I was under the impression the establishment of a real bond, tough and new and unlike the weakness of my parents marriage, had occured.  I was wrong.  I was caught off guard.  I was so fucking supportive of her, proud of her, watched her develop into the swan she (at least was) to me today.  I loved her more than anything, I wanted to have her babies.  And I used to hate little kids.    I remember it as if it was yesterday.......(memory sequence now- Wayne's World - doodaladoo, doodaladoo)    It was Valentine's Day, 1995.  Nic Cruz, awkward freshman at Bayside High, 14 years old and already lovingly known as 'bulbous', due to the bulbous nature of my huge head, has just gotten off the bus, coming back from a disappointing encounter with what was my first real girlfriend ever, also her birthday.  You see I've already seen Jill here and there, she was already a sophomore, and as we all know, the older woman allure was very taboo in high school society.  I had a crush, more like an odd feeling whenever I saw her or heard her speak, since I really didn't know anything about her.  I never dared speak to her though.      On this sunny day, I was walking through the park right across the street, in deep thought as unfortunately I am most of the time.  Thats when she came into view over the hill.  She was revealed slowly, as if a curtain were raising.  Thats when I saw her.  She was leaning against the black, cast iron fence that surrounded the school.  She had on one of her ironic, funny saying T-shirts.  This one was bright green.  Her hair fell over it, so gently.  She had beautiful long brown curly hair, two strips in the front bleached blond (damn smashing pumpkins).  Her breasts, even at that time, enthralled me, not too big, not too small, but situated firmly inside that shirt.  Her hips too, which I also can't get out of my mind to this moment, were tightly packed inside her cute corduroy pants (she called them potato-chip pants).  Red doc martin-like boots (the name escapes me).  Her long, slightly rounded face, so beautiful to me (even now), and lightly freckled, had the pleasure of being the home of two, HUGE, wondering and innocent blue eyes.  Long lashes.  She seemed upset or something.  I spoke.  I didn't stop for 8 years.  She was the love of my life.  More on that cunt later.    There is just too much going on now.  I'm losing it, and strangely I don't worry about the outcome anymore.  Now thats living.  Ha!  I'm crying right now.  Lachrymology, thats it.  Google it if you want, or whatever the hell it is you crazy kids call it these days.  I'm crazy, I want to die.  My body doesn't work anymore, and my mind is slowly rotting away.  No energy anymore, just pain.  And its not just girl problems, she doesn't give a fuck and I should stop too.  Thats logical.      I'm an animal now, and everything on this sad planet is mine.  I have to start taking.  Every single thing on earth will either be eaten, fucked, loved or killed by me.  Thats all I can do, and I'll stop pretending I should be doing something else.    \nWhew!  Anyway, how bout that Smarty Jones, huh?  I think that horse is great, he looks so happy and cute, unlike most of these other race horses that look pissed off all the time.  And his owner?  Damn, I hope that guy makes it long enough to even see the Stakes!  If his horse wins again, you're likely to see him die on live T.V.   Jesus was in this guys high school year book for crying out loud!  I mean, this guy is O-L-D, old!  Sorry, enough of that.    \nFirst undefeated horse to win both the derby and Preakness since Seattle Slew.  Remember Seattle Slew?  Of course you don't!  that was a hundred years ago.  No cinderella bullshit story here, just the first triple crown winner in a long long time.  I'll be at Belmont this year (ladies take note), cheering this horse on and probably losing.   He had no idea what the fuck was going on, he was just having fun.  I love animals, I converse (not in a cat person crazy way) with my dog Brandy for hours sometimes.   Fortunately that horse was luckier than not-so smarty Roy Jones Jr.  Did you see that?  He had his fuckin head knocked off.  He literally slid outside of the ring.  But he deserved it, he's an asshole but he did show a humility in loss thats rarely seen now in boxing.  Not to mention the HBO cameraman who was subsequently knocked afterwards during a live feed.   \nNow, for those of you waiting in suspense, here is that crazy ass dream..........     I start in some shore community.  It is walled in by mountains lying in the ocean.  I'm in a pub.  An old man starts some kind of shouting disturbance, with no notable consequence.  Seemingly contagious, another man right next to me starts getting frantic, and is chased out.  I am standing at that moment with a group of young guys, around my age.  In the confusion the old man next to me, the young guys, and now me too are running from the ensuing crowd.  I follow them outside, jumping into the ocean and following them.  I am immediately pulled into a strong current, heading straight towards the border of mountains.  At the last second as I am approaching a rocky death, a tunnel type hole comes into view, and I'm sucked through it.  I notice the first old man has just passed through, slightly ahead of me, and now the chasing mob is getting closer.    \nOn the other side, the gloomy weather and dark cold water are gone, now the sea is bright, blue, and shimmering.  Beautiful.  I see a two step platform short waterfall.  I jump very high, an ability I recognize as having often in my dreams.  Forward leap, then I'm at the mouth of a small cave.  An ancient clay pot sits on the left side of the entrance.   There are thin stalks of green plants inside.  One of the younger guys ahead of me takes one out and enters.  He turns back to me.  'Let me do the talking'    \nInside it is furnished like a home, slightly familiar.  What can best be described as a 'hot' girl greets us.  I ask her what the hell is going on.  One of the old men says he couldn't take it anymore and wasn't able to stay at that shore place we came from.  He's not too specific (could this be a 'Logan's Run' reference).  Ol' Nic is already analyzing at this point, while still in the friggin dream!  I ask him where we are.  He gives me a name I can't remember.  Apparently this new place is some kind of island.  It appears to be foreign to me (ie; another country)    \nTime passes, and I end up using the bathroom here often.  It seems to be a big house inside this cave.  Comfortable, wooden, and rustic.  There are a lot of bathrooms here.  One of them has two doors, one from the hallway, the other leading out into the kitchen.  It has inside a bidet, pink porcelain toilet, and a shower.    \nNow the girl, wearing clam digger pants, high sandals with painted red toes, flirty, says we have to get ready for the 'party'.  By now the old men are gone, and I'm left in the house with one other young man, this girl, and what seems to be her mother.  The girl takes the other guy upstairs for what she says is 'hair and wardrobe'    \nThe girl's mother offers me some home made cookies.  I drop one on to the carpet and pick it up. I examine them, breaking one apart and ask 'are there any nuts in these'  (note: in reality I have a bad food allergy to most nuts and sesame seeds so thats usually a standard question for me).  I notice now she is still standing there, looking over me and obviously wondering why I haven't eaten.  She tells me there are nuts in them, but I should try eating them anyway, they probably won't bother me.  I tell her sorry, I don't mean to be rude but I can't.  She apologizes for being 'in my face'.   I end up taking a bite anyway, it is the dream world after all, right?  Well it turns out I'm still allergic and I get up to get rid of the cookies.    \nI start going upstairs.  The banister leading up is very warped.  Touching the pole at the beginning, the entire white chipped painted railing begins to creak and sway side to side.  The party is starting now.  Everyone is very friendly.  They seem smart, warm and college-aged.  Not noticing this before, I'm wearing glasses.  Somehow they break and someone offers me theirs.  Some time has passed again and simultaneously myself and another girl sitting down mention to the guy who gave me the glasses thats its strange we happened to have the same prescription.    \nAll of a sudden, I'm back home on Jamaica Avenue (real home).  I'm in what seems to be a 1 hour photo place or a travel agency across the street from my apartment.  There seems to be a get-together there also.  2 familiar hispanic girls from the other party are there, now dressed in french maid outfits (nothing sexy).  They are walking around passing drinks to the crowd on trays.  They seem to be whispering and giggling about me.  In the store's front area, 2 middle aged men are standing there, seemingly in good spirits.  They are hairy, nude, but with no penises.  They ask me how my trip was and I ask exactly where the fuck that place was that I was at.  They don't give me straight answer as to where exactly this island is.  They say its rumored.  J.F.K. and a couple of other notable people and celebrities were secretly born there.   He says there is a small population there, and they commute (via ferry?) back and forth for work and supplies.  Then a couple comes out of the hall and complains that they haven't been seated yet, and that people are ignoring them.  I walk into another room where Jill (who has recently become my ex), is sitting.  I ask her why she dumped me, and of course she doesn't answer (another parallel to reality), I ask her if she has slept with anyone, she matter of factly, and with pleasure nods her head yes.  'Of course' she says, 'and quite a few'.    \nThats all I remember.  Nic, big sopping emotional pussy Nic was jarred from sleep at that moment, in tears, (which happen a lot now, at the worst times, in public, on the train, in front of my family).",

        "blog_text": "This is one of my personal favorites of all the articles I have written. Allow me to introduce myself:  I am your mother; father, brother, sister, best friend, girlfriend, boyfriend, neighbor, waitress, classmate, coach, co-worker, possibly even your physician.  I am of many faces and varied ages.  I possess higher education or little education at all.  I am found in all classes, races and religions of society.  To look at me, you would never imagine that I hold a secret, that in a particular situation and with the slightest sin of omission, I could affect your life in such a way that would alter life as you know it.  What could this secret possibly be?  It is Genital Herpes!  As a person with genital herpes, I can often live in an ongoing fear of telling you of my condition.  I suffer this fear as the result of your possible ignorance.  How is it that one person should live in the fear of another person’s lack of knowledge?  It’s true!  Nearly 50 million new cases diagnosed each year will walk this same dreadful walk.  The voices of conscience continually asking “will this person run from me?”  “Will this person mock me?”  So many times, I will draw the conclusion that the unknown response is the best and I will make my exit from your life.  Never knowing if you might have been asking yourself those same questions.  The statistics would indicate it is likely that you could, but then again, the risk and fear prevent me from speaking openly with you.  Over time, I have been placed in situations where I was made to feel sub-human.  Listening to jokes, ridicule and hurtful comments by all those who suffer from ignorance, up to and including talk show hosts that are admired by millions across the U.S.  I have been a person who has had the quality of life snatched right out from under my feet, simply because I acted on human nature and had a sexual relationship with another person who’s life was affected by genital herpes.  What can you do as a person that I may encounter?  Become aware!   Genital herpes can be treated .  With proper knowledge and consideration for you, I have the ability to protect you.  Though I cannot completely eliminate your risk, I can minimize it tremendously.    Understand that just because I have genital herpes, this does not mean I am infectious 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  It simply means I may become contagious a few times per year.  Know that with proper care of my body, time can further reduce the frequency of when I might pass along this virus.  If I am a person with genital herpes and have taken the time to get to know my body and how this virus reacts in it’s active state, I can recognize early symptoms that may further reduce my risk to you.  You have looked at people many times over your life that bore the symbol of herpes in the form of a cold sore.  Were you quick to stand in judgment of them?  Did you assume they had a severe cold or flu and perhaps that cold sore was the lingering aftermath of that battle?  You assumed wrong!  That cold sore is herpes and has little to do with a cold or flu.  In fact, cold sores are becoming the most common cause of genital herpes cases diagnosed in the U.S. month after month.  As a person living with genital herpes, I ask you to learn more about me.  Place me in a position that I may feel more at ease speaking openly with you.  Let me see that a disclosure of such a personal nature will not be comparable to a scene from some old Friday night horror flick in which you would run screaming in fear.  If you would be open to my confiding in you, you may just learn that I am the most honest and trustworthy person that you could encounter.  The majority of us living with genital herpes have found ourselves in this situation by no choice of our own, having been the victim of deception, cheating spouses or significant others.  Not only do we carry the burden of a former deception, we have a lingering reminder of that breech of trust thrust upon us by another.  Certainly, in many cases genital herpes is a form of baggage from a relationship past, but in the face of an understanding person, it does not have to be emotional baggage.  Genital herpes can be a secret borne by anyone, regardless of gender, status, or background.  The next person that you encounter is potentially one of us.  It is everyone's responsibility to understand the pervasive nature of this condition, and to develop a working knowledge of how it influences those around us.",

        "blog_text": "I should travel more often. My wife recently pointed out to me that I seem to get a lot of good writing ideas when we're on the road somewhere. I always take a small laptop or portable computer with me, and whenever the chance comes up, I'm busy writing.  During a trip we took to Eastern Europe in 2002, I wrote the outline for 'Ribeye the Bullbarian and the Jewel of Baloni' during that trip. There was a lot of time we spent sitting on airplanes, on trains, ferryboats, etc. that was excellent writing time. I did a lot of writing outdoors in a big public park in Tartu, Estonia, and in the Esplanade Park in central Helsinki, Finland.  I simply love to travel to other places, and write there, amid an atmosphere that inspires me in some different way than my home in Los Angeles. I'm a big fan of taking weekend writing sabbaticals, driving somewhere where I won't have too many distractions of home, and writing. I just recently went on a 're-writing/editing' sabbatical in Palm Springs, one of my favorite places to get away.  At the start of 2003, I had to travel back and forth several times to North Carolina and Virginia to deal with a family medical emergency. Though none of it was by any means a trip for pleasure, the good that came out of it (besides seeing my family) was that I did a huge amount of writing during the travel time. Large sections of my first novel were written in hotel rooms in North Carolina, in the air over the country, and in airport stopovers all across the country.  I like to think a little bit of each place I travel shows up in my stories. There are always people to meet and places to see that spark the imagination. I find that the wide-open spaces of the American West in particular can't help but inspire a writer. Every rock mesa, every canyon, every cliff, every painted desert vista tells a story all to itself.  Last summer I was stranded for five days in the Mojave desert. I had gone for a day drive and my car's radiator blew up. (Thank God for both AAA and cell phones by the way). I had to have my car towed 38 miles from the middle of nowhere to the sleepy outskirts of Barstow California, and there I was stuck in a hotel for five days while the parts had to be ordered to fix my car. I always have a portable computer with me, so I spent those five days writing, even though I hadn't planned them. A three hour tour, turned into a five day mini-exile.  Right next door to the motel I stayed in, was a small farm with a chicken coop out back. Just watching those chickens gave me some ideas for an book/cartoon series Mike and I had been kicking around for years called 'The Barnyard Avenger'. I spent those few days dreaming up Barnyard Avenger situations, as well as outlining some other projects. What could have been terrible downtime, turned out to be an unexpected windfall.  Little unexpected things like that are the best forms of inspiration. Naturally, I love the idea of traveling and writing. Even if it's only driving out of town for the weekend, and parking myself in the shade of a Yucca tree somewhere in the California desert and working on a chapter or two, getting out of the house and out into the world is a major inspiration that keeps me writing.",

While so many of my friends are busy buying cars and trying to move out, I am juggling school and a dead end job to save up enough money to go overseas. At the end of 2003 I made a decision to spend 2005, the year after I finish high school, going on a holiday around the world.   I spent a few nights on the internet looking for a good ‘round the world’ flight package for me. Although the Star Alliance seemed to have some cheap deals, they didn’t cater for all of the places I wanted to go. Then I came across the One World 5 Continents offer. It is so good it’s a joke. On their web page they have a few sample itineraries for travelers, and they involve going to about 8 places for AUD$3300. Through some reading of the rules applicable to the ticket, I found that I could travel to 20 places in five continents of my choosing for the same price. Considering that nowadays it can cost AUD$2000 for a ticket to the United States, it’s incredible that for just over a grand more you can go to 19 other cities.   When I took my itinerary to the local Flight Centre, they were stunned by the amount of places I had written down. They mentioned to me several times that it was the largest trip that they had ever handled, and that my journey was a ‘travel agent’s dream’. They also gave me loads of good advice on traveling safe and healthy in third world places.   As I am only 17, and unsure of whether my family (who are very supportive) will help me out financially on this trip, I concluded that it was time to get a good job and start putting in long hours.   I applied to a furniture factory who was offering jobs in the newspaper. After a quick interview, I was part of the team. Not counting the sawdust that causes cancer, the time a wheel broke and a 2m high trolley came crashing down on me, several other health and safety violations and an hourly wage of AUD$8.65, I enjoy the job because they give me hours when I need them and the people there are nice.   The main way I save money is by trying not to go out on Friday and Saturday night much. I only go to parties when they are important and I know who will be there, and when I don’t have to spend money on transportation. Before I had to save money, I used to go to any parties just to fill up my weekend because I had more fun going out than staying at home. I made myself stop doing this and now I actually rarely go to parties unless they one of my close friends is holding one.   As I still live with my parents, I find that many weeks I will spend absolutely nothing and the money will go straight into the bank untouched. I actually lost my wallet a while ago and I think it helped me save about AUD$300 because I couldn’t touch my money until another bankcard came.   The reality is, if I can save for a trip like this, than any other kid that doesn’t have any living expenses could do it also. Going on holidays for about 300 days and seeing a large quantity of the world in that time may seem reserved only for the ultra-rich, but it is actually is an obtainable goal if you are willing to put in the hard hours for it. Right now, I have AUD$1500 in the bank, all of which I have saved this year, and when school finishes I will be making AUD$400 a week. I figure that I will be able to save up at least AUD$5000 dollars this year and then earn more money in L.A., because my grandfather owns a furniture factory which I can work in.",

        "blog_text": "This could be my father's story. Almost. Or my mother's, for that matter. In May 1944, Stasiek was in a trench looking up at the monastery of Monte Cassino, the Nazi-held stronghold in Italy that commanded the road to Rome, and anchored the German 'Gustav' line. The fortress was considered almost impregnable. My father, also Staszek, was there too. Labelled 1944, this must be Italy. That he survived the battle was remarkable. More remarkable yet was what he and his comrades had survived to reach that point. The Russians would've come for my mother's family in the night, but they had advance word. My grandfather's mistress had 'information,' and she helped ensure my family's passage to Arkhangelsk, a safer alternative than others. There was a logging industry. My mother remembers the barges, how her brother nearly lost his life. My mother has a fear of water. There were many trains and villages. When we watch Doctor Zhivago, my mother says it was like that, the trains, the poverty, the snow. Samarkand, Tashkent, Dzhambul, Frunze, Alma Ata. At the Chinese border, they were turned back. The family is being divided. My grandfather and his oldest son have joined the first division. Marysia volunteers her services to communications efforts in Pahlevi. Dyzio and Krysia are placed in orphanages. My mother is the youngest of the siblings, and my grandmother keeps her close. The surviving Poles walked or hitched rides on boxcars, thousands of miles over the endless steppe and taiga. Many were walking skeletons by the time they reached their transit camps near the Caspian Sea. Wracked with disease and starving to death, families were separated, never finding each other again. Parents lost their children, children their parents. Krasnovodsk. The Caspian Sea. Pahlevi. The family is finding each other. Poles have been allowed some freedoms. Someone is in love with Marysia and is helping deliver messages. Tehran. Ahvaz. My grandmother suffers from dysentery. My mother is blind from malnutrition. Tranports are arriving. There are refugee camps in India. I don't know precisely how my father came to be thrown in prison. Though only 14 or 15 years old at the time, he was already a subversive, distributing socialist literature. I believe he was taken while at school. He never saw his family again. A Russian prison camp. That's my father fourth in line. He tried to trade his bread ration for cigarettes. A fellow prisoner took him under his wing and set him straight — war is no time to be a smartass. (That man was a prince.) I never heard the story from my father, but legend has it he escaped. Penza, Mosul, Kirkuk, Baghdad, Aden, Asmara. He joined with the Polish forces that had been allowed to mobilize under British command. Iraq, November 1942. Setting up camp. Staszek survived Monte Cassino, survived a bullet to the elbow. My mother's father and her brother were there too, but they wouldn't know Stan till years later, in Coventry, when he'd rent a room from the family. There is some crucial part of his story that I've missed, something I may never understand. In the long journey from the Soviet gulag, through the battlefields of Italy, to his new homeland, through the losses and the pain, something happened during his trials that freed his soul, something that I may never grasp. He has turned the other cheek and come away with his soul and his humanity intact.",

Bask in the glory left over by a recently departed Prime Minister rapt with the idea of slimming our youth?  Hire a car and join the locals doing blockies?  Or address part 3 of the electoral queries posted at The Road to Surfdom ?  I could sleep, but instead I’ll take the third option.  So what are the sort of issues that I’ll consider important prior to my vote in the coming Federal election?  The prominent thing that keeps entering my mind as I consider the sitting Government and the alternative is the lack of integrity I see in the Liberal/National coalition.  The blind following of the US into Iraq when the real War on Terror was there to be won in the hills of Afghanistan and the subsequent justification on the grounds of regime change have left a bitter taste in my mouth that just don’t seem to be able to shake.  And I’m a traditionally conservative voter.  But there are other concerns too.  I’m concerned about the continuing privatisation of our institutions and the debilitating effect this may have on the ability of all Australians to participate in our society.  I was lucky.  My university education only cost me $7500.  If I’d completed it back in the late 80’s when I should have it would have been free.  My 16 year old stepson will now face a cost in the tens of thousands to do an equivalent degree in a few years time.  He’s come from a family that have been able to afford him a decent preparation, both educationally and socially, for such an experience.  I fear for those who haven’t been so fortunate.  I’m concerned about our country becoming a victim of its own success, where the accumulation of private wealth totally consumes the ideal of building up the community spirit that we should all foster and enjoy.  I’m concerned for kids that will be second, third or fourth generation illiterate in a society that only established formalised high school education for all in the last 100 years.  I’m concerned that a cultural and intellectual elite will get more and more focused on itself and isolate those already marginalised in the community.    I’m concerned that accountability, real and tangible accountability, will only be available to shareholders, rather than stakeholders.  I’m concerned that we will become one of the dumbest Western nations in the world simply because we imposed targets on schools that they could never meet and thereafter reduced the funding that could enable them to reach decent standards in the future.  I’m concerned that even these current educational standards are being lowered to cater to apologists that want everyone to feel good before they actually achieve something.  I’m concerned for the decay in family values and the family system.  I’m sick of  pretending that everything’s all right when it isn’t.  I’m sick of spineless men that can only provide dominance rather than leadership and I weep for the leaders that we won’t have when I’m old if we don’t stop selling our future down the drain.  I’m concerned for the environment that we live in.  Will we have enough water to go around in 50 years time?  Can jobs now replace forests in the future?  I don’t know enough about these issues to have an adequately informed opinion so I have to trust those who claim they do.  But when they are private business with an eye on the dollar or a Government unwilling to challenge an environmental monopoly, how much can I trust them to act or speak in the public good?  I’m concerned for our place in the world.  We live in a region that we no longer seem to reach out to.  We only seem to fear our northern neighbours.  We differ on religion and other beliefs and yet we share a commonality in geography that behoves us to reach out and create dialogue and encourage trade.  We decline the opportunity to think for ourselves and jump when The Man says ‘jump’.  We have an alliance with the most powerful nation in the world and we invoke that alliance in every policy decision that may come within cooee of it, regardless of the harm it may cause to our national identity and sense of self.  My vote will go to the party that will provide me with some answers to these concerns.  Some may label these as small target issues.  I prefer to regard them as real concerns.  Real concerns that have to be addressed every now and then if we care about how we live and our place in the world.  These are some of the issues that give us an identity and some character.  Anyone can earn a buck.  It’s how you earn it and more importantly what you do with it that indicates character and I’ll be looking for some indicators that answer these concerns.",

Long line-ups... good lunch... a nice walk back to Wonderland... Nima was really nice and gave me his jacket when I was cold. Tried 3 times, but we still couldn't win the cute stuffed doberman I wanted. Blah! It was totally cute though. Oh well. So anyways... it was okay. I got a huge headache from being carsick and also ride sick. The wind blowing against me and my head going against the restraints really gave me a big headache. At Bethel, I didn't feel like doing anything. Spent some time in the stairway with Vivo, Erica, Zoe, IngiEE, Candace, and Mark and we just talked. Nima was inside playing basketball the whole time. Then we went inside and I saw Nima on the stage so I went beside him. We just sat there for a while and he helped some girl with her guitaring. I only sat and watched. Then he went back to play basketball before I got the chance to talk to him. Whatever. Jason came over and sat down beside me and we talked for a while. He's a very pokey person! Haha! He kept poking my cheeks and IngiEE's cheeks. Haha! Funny guy. He has this baby-ish voice and it's really funny. Blah. Then Jason took a pic with me using his cellphone and also with IngiEE. Haha! It was a lot of fun talking to them and messing around. Made my headache go away. Got me a little hyper. ^^   Nima stopped playing basketball and played some piano. I was gonna go and sit beside him to talk but I didn't think he'd want to be disturbed when he played the piano so I just let him be and continued talking with Jason and the others. Haha... he needed gum so I shared my last 3 pieces of Bubblicious with him and some girl. Exchanged MSN addresses. BlahzZ~! I didn't really get to know him until tonight. We talked a little and he's really fun to hang around.   I missed Nima and really wanted to talk to him and just take a nap on his shoulder but he was always busy playing his basketball and piano and crap so I just let him do his thing while I talked to the other people. So tired... Too bad... maybe I'll get to talk to Nima some other time. Whatever...  I'm so tired but I don't want to go to bed. I miss him. I want to talk to him a bit before I go to bed but probably won't get the chance. He'd probably be in bed, playing CounterStrike, on the phone with Alice/Jordan/Erica, or playing with his guitar. Blah. I don't know why... but I always like talking to people. It just... is. I like talking to my friends, with my close friends, my best friends, anybody and everybody. I just wish Nima and I could talk more... I find that talking relieves the tension and awkwardness between people. Whatever. He and I will talk when he wants to talk...  Hmm, saw Aaron today but didn't really talk. Saw Derek and Brian too... Why was Mich, Derek, and Brian all there but not Auntie Amy? Her children are there but not her... Nooo! Haha~ I miss Auntie Amy most out of all of them.   Hmm, almost forgot... Lisa's back. I had a huge headache and wasn't exactly feeling the greatest while talking to my friends in the stairway. All of a sudden, I see someone pull some luggage thing into the place where we were and I saw her. Lisa. At first I thought I was hallucinating from being so dizzy 'cos Lisa was supposed to come back in September or whatever! Oh well... I missed her so much. One of the people I trust most. I tell her everything... Or used to. She was really busy in Texas so yeah. Well she came back early. I hope it's not a bad thing like getting kicked out or whatever. *sighzZ* I doubt I'll get to talk to her a lot anyway... she'll be really busy talking to everyone who also missed her and stuff.   Nima had his arms around me most of the time at Wonderland and I could almost still feel them there. Haha! Iunno. Weird. My mind keeps going back to Nima. See?! No matter who I'm with, where I'm at, or when it is... Nima's on my mind. Can't get him out. Don't want to get him out. Like I said to him today, 'I could lose as much money as I want, or lose anything... but I don't want to lose you.' I love him... I just hope he realizes just how I feel for him. *sighzZ* Whatever.

'hey, he's not a bad guy and he's from the US! they can't all suck...' still, there's very little you can do here. even when they like you, sometimes that crumbles away to nothing once they find out you're from the states. my friend jennifer was at a bar talking with some guy. they were chatting and getting along fairly well and eventually he asked where she was from - - - - and the amiable look and friendly demeanor melted away into this vicious snarl 'i HATE americans!!!' and he promptly refused to have anything to do with her. i guess that alone wouldn't bug me overmuch - i mean, there are plenty of times the US pisses me off too - but to hold every single american accountable for the actions of a small portion (government, tourists, etc)? that's just blatant prejudice. you're view of someone shouldn't suddenly spin 180 solely on an accident of birth. what's worse is the gigantic hypocrisy of the sentiments. all right, i'm perfectly willing to accept that the US is pretty darn hypocritical too when it comes to telling other countries stuff like 'oh you can't burn the rainforest down; it's precious! the very thought of all that forest burning makes tears come to my eyes as i sit here in my nice plush Gas Guzzler 5000.' but it's really fucking annoying when american music, TV, books, and movies are so eagerly sought after here while the culture that produced them is vilified. AND it's not even like they understand the US... actually, it makes me think of Mr. Griswold's description of the anti-masons. 'what are you?' 'we're anti-masons.' 'what do the masons want?' 'we don't know - but we're against them!' for instance, they have a sandwich in the local cafeteria called an 'american'. why? because it has mayonnaise. it's like they think we inject it in our veins or something. 'american pizza' is so strange i can't even describe it. burgers come with 'american sauce' which is some kind of bizzare blend of ketchup, mustard, relish, mayonnaise, and coca cola. okay, so i made the coca cola thing up, but the sauce is unlike anything i've ever encountered previously. it goes beyond that too. people (and not just french people) are under the impression that everyone in the US has a gun - almost as though we're issued them at birth. i don't think i KNOW anyone who owns a gun (excluding police officers, of course). maybe someone i know does have one and i just don't know about it. in fact, it's probably likely - but nowhere near everyone. or the flag? riiiight - there's some kind of 'children of the corn' impression they have about our flag; that we have some kind of cultish reverence for it. first off, yes it IS a symbol and the government tries to promote it as such - but it's not like i go around saluting every american flag i see. in fact, i doubt i've done the pledge of allegiance since 8th grade. even before that, do you think the pledge means anything to a child? it's not as though 99% of them understand what they're saying. it's more like 'hey, after i say this they let me sit down again.' however, i also admit that the american flag is much more prominent with this new wave of patriotism. and yet, the only place i can recall seeing the flag on a t-shirt is here in france...on french people. in regards to another relatively recent phenomenom, one of my friends was talking about people flying american flags from their cars/trucks and said something about 'driving along with pointy white sheets over their heads' and that 'the Klu Klux Klan is very patriotic.' i don't think he believed me when i said they were one of the most reviled groups in the country. and perhaps they ARE patriotic...but to what nation? i always viewed them as having secessionist views given their allegiance to the confederacy. sure, the flag's important to them, but it's the stars and bars flag. and aren't patriots supposed to uphold and safeguard the ideals of their nation? it's really sad to find out that other countries think the US has the same ideals as the KKK. i think i'll stop my little cathartic rant here. see you tomorrow. same bat-time. same bat-channel.",

        "blog_text": "Luke 16:19 - 21  'There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. At his gate was laid a begger named Lazarus, covered with sores and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.'  I had a dream a couple nights ago. I drempt I was among several people on the street. Some were drunk. Some were high on drugs. Some were sick, diseased and really skinny. Some were disabled with no legs, no eyes, no hands. Some were starving. Some were dirty, smelled really bad, torn clothes and no shoes. Some were laying on the sidewalk. Some were in wheelchairs. Some were leaning against a brick wall.   As I walked thru the midst of all these people, every one was crying and reaching out to me saying, 'Please, help me.' I would tell them to go to the park in Indianapolis the next Sat. and they would get food and clothes. I would tell them to go to the Isaiah 61 meeting on Fri. night and they would get help. I would invite them to come to church on Sun. I walked thru them telling them what they needed to do and where they needed to go to get help.  Each one of them, men, women and children kept reaching out to me begging and crying, 'We have no way and cannot get to those places. We need help now. Please help us NOW.' The dogs were even showing more compassion for them than I was.    As I continued to walk, I came to a lady who was nothing but skin and bones. She had long dark hair that was all matted together. Her clothes were all torn, she had no shoes. She looked and smelled like she hadn't had a bath in months. She had no teeth and was leaning against the brick wall smoking a cigarette. She was very rude and began cussing me. She was not reaching out to me nor was she asking for help. Here is what she said: 'You are just like all the rest of so called 'Christians'. You live in  homes with furniture, air conditioning and heat. You have your cars to go to the places you need to go to. You have all you want to eat and waste more than it would take to feed us. You have your Dr. and medications. You have your beds to sleep in, your nice clothes and shoes to wear. You have all the luxuries. You are nothing but pampered and spoiled brats. You come out here to us to make YOURSELF feel good but won't even bend down to shake a hand because we are dirty & sick. You won't give us food or meet any of our needs because we are not in the place you think we should be. Just get out of here and leave us alone. We don't need people like you.'  I stood there in tears. I knew in my heart she was right and what she was saying was true. We seem to think that people need to be in a certain place to be able to minister to them. We go out for a short time just to make OURSELVES feel good and to be able to tell others 'what we did'. We don't want to get our hands dirty by touching any of 'those kinds of people'. We want to be where we can get to our anticeptic hand cleaner and our Lysol spray disinfectant QUICKLY, so we don't get the germs that 'those kinds of people' have.   I knelt down beside the lady and took her hand. I ask her to forgive me and told her that I love her and Jesus loves her. Tears began to flow down her face. She said there has never been anyone tell her they loved her or that Jesus loves her. She said nobody wanted to be around her because of her 'condition'. I put my arms around her and ask her if I could pray with her. She said 'Yes, nobody has ever prayed for me before.'  Then I woke up. I sat up in bed and began to ask God to forgive me. I thought I was doing the right thing. I go to the homeless twice a month. I go to the jail and prisons. I hold Isaiah 61 meetings once a week. I THOUGHT I was being like Jesus and doing like Jesus done, as the Bible tells us to do. I THOUGHT I was being a servant and serving those in need.  The problem is, I pass by all those people I am around every day. Those I see in the grocery store, WalMart, resturants, neighbors, family, on vacation, at work, people I talk to on the phone (even those salesman!) etc. etc. I wait until I am at the 'right place' before I minister to their needs.  There is a man I know that said he didn't know how he was called to minister to anyone. I ask him if he talks to people at work about Jesus. He said no because they would think he was crazy and wouldn't listen to him anyway. He said they are VERY worldly, cussing, talking about other people, talking about all they done over the weekend, etc. etc. So he just goes to work, does his job, stays to himself, and goes home.   This is a prime example of how most 'Christians' are. These may be the very people God has put before him like the lady in my dream. A person that only needs someone to love them, just the way they are. To be willing to get their hands dirty or their 'spiritual clothes' stained with the dirt of the world. To just reach out and say that you care. That you love them and Jesus loves them. Not to hit them over the head with 'religion' and  all they are doing wrong, where they need to go, inviting them to church, etc. But to love them in the gutter of life they may be living in.   Why do alcoholics spend so much time in bars and around other alcoholics? Because those people will listen to them no matter how they look, smell, etc. The bar is their church and the bartender is their pastor and friend.   It is time that we get out of our selfishness and begin to BE JESUS and not just TALKING JESUS. WILLING to give up ALL WE HAVE for those who are 'scum' of the earth, like Jesus did for US. (Yes, we were 'scum' to Him. He gave up EVERYTHING and He was willing to die for US). Willing to get our hands dirty and our 'spiritual clothes' stained. Willing to help someone, in their time of need, no matter where they are. Once people SEE the real Jesus in you, they will want Him to.   I thought I was doing what God called me to do until I had the dream. Stop inviting people to come to church, Bible study, etc. and start BEING THE CHURCH. Then the masses will come in.

I know for certain this questioning will not lead to a complete overhaul of what I know and understand to be true but, God willing, it will lead to a deeper knowledge and understanding of who I am, and what my motivations are- particularly in the 'religious' sense.  The other night trying to fall asleep I found myself restless....kept awake by the idea that I'm a cheater, that I'm insincere, that my attempt at a spiritual life is being kept alive by nothing more than self-motivation and ego.  I began to ask myself - 'Why do I make attempts to worship God in the Orthodox Church?'  Is it the need to feel superior to the 'other half' who live without the Church. Is it a feeling of belonging which drives me? Is it a psychological need, possibly stemming from  my personal experiences, which has led me to attempt feebly to approach God?Is it a desire for some kind of mystical experience which will deliver me from the monotony of day to day life?  Is it the fear of death and final judgement? Do I only call on God in times of need- reducing God to a wish-giver of sorts? Is my religion a  crutch ?  If these things are true... then my Christianity is fake- it is a thin and cheap facade only existing to satisfy myself, not God.  If this is true, then perhaps the critics of 'organized religion' are correct, at least about me and my ego driven self-satisfying motivations.  My former priest used to say frequently:  'We must become less, so that He may become more.'   Is my Christianity an emptying of the self, or is it pleasing to the self in its comforting concepts, its ritual, its talk of Church life which foster feelings of self-importance.

Often, the butterfly doesn't know that it has been caught, it's perfectly content no matter what. The catcher then puts the butterfly in a jar for a while, to study it.  just remember: most butterflies that are caught end up with pins sticking through them, trophies of the catcher as he hunts down another helpless victim.  but there is one catcher who doesn't use a net, and he has seen the most beautiful butterfly of all...  but there is one problem: this butterfly has already been caught in a net, and she seems perfectly happy to remain in that net forever, she can't even see it.  but our catcher still tries. If he used a net, he knows he would have a good chance of catching this butterfly, and he would definitely be able to catch any other one he wished. But he knows, you should never settle for less when it comes to butterfly catching.  he will not settle for less than this butterfly, nor will he settle for more, because there is no butterfly more beautiful than this one. But he refuses to use a net out of fear that it might hurt the butterfly, or even worse, scare her away.  so instead he holds out his hand, with a small bit of sugar on it, hoping that the butterfly will come to him of her own free will, because he knows that this is not something that can be forced on someone.  but the butterfly flies off, she can't even see him standing there. He follows as best as he can, but it's no use, he can barely keep up with her.  he continues to follow as fast as he can, heedless of where his feet take him. He knows that he may very well stumble off a cliff and fall to his death in this chase, but it doesn't matter. If he can't catch this butterfly, he'll die trying.  and so the butterfly flies around, still trapped in her jar. She could get out if she really wanted to, all butterflies can, but they can never see the jar until it's too late.  and our catcher continues, he doesn't want to stick the butterfly in a jar of his own, or pin her up behind glass. He just wants her to land on his shoulder, and comfort him as he wanders.  he knows he has very little hope, he knows that the butterfly probably won't see him, but he's going to keep following her wherever she goes.  he doesn't know whether or not she wants out of her jar, he just wishes she would open up her eyes and see him.  he'll make it his life's goal, catching this butterfly. He's going to follow her forever, watching out for her whether she cares or not...  and so he continues to follow her, follow the butterfly, and finally, he gains some courage, and he gets closer to her...  and she sees him, she finally begins to open her eyes and see him. But... She can only see him as a friend, and nothing more. She still has no reason to abandon the one who has already caught her and go to him, because she is happy as she is...  when he first found that she had already been caught, he began to slip, he stumbled as he followed her, and he fell off a Cliff. He was falling, tumbling, turning over and over in turmoil when a white dove flew past and revealed to him that the cliff wasn't all that tall after all, and he landed on his feet with the help of the dove, and he continued to follow the butterfly, to watch her more closly, if only from a distance.  if only he could get her to open her eyes farther, she might be able to see him, the real him. just once he would like that, he would like that very much indeed. even if it means he has to fall off another cliff for it to happen.  but he is much closer to her now, close enough to talk to her, perhaps even close enough to tell her how he feels. But...would that really fix anything?  no, it wouldn't, it would only complicate things even more than they already are. as he saw earlier, she is already perfectly happy to remain where she is forever. the only thing that matters to him is for her to be safe and happy, her happiness comes first, before everything else, before even his own life, if needs be.   and so he... He does what will hurt him the most, he...stops chasing her. He just lets her flutter off. he'll still be there if she ever wants to return, but he isn't going to force her. it's because he understands now, he understands just what it means to truly love someone, he understands that if you love someone, you want the best for them, you want them to be truly happy above all else. and that is how he feels about this butterfly, he truly does love her, more than he could have possibly thought it was possible for anyone to love anything.   and so she flutters off into her future, and he remains behind, knowing full well that there is nothing that could possibly be any more painful for him. But he also knows that it is best for her if her life remains simple, she is happy where she is so why ask her to change anything?  and he speaks to her, even though she has gone and can no longer hear him...  'Please, please forgive me but i do love you. please understand how i feel about you. even if you can't love me back, just know that i will always love you.i only want you to be happy, if you want me to just leave and not bother you asgain...then i will do as you wish. i have no desire for you to be happy, just please grant me this one wish of mine: ...please continue to grow, grow and become stronger and more beautiful, continue to grow forever...' and so he watches her fluttering off on those delicate wings into the sunset, and...He smiles slightly, as a tear rolls down his face...  'i love you, i always have, and i always will. i will wait for the time that you fly to me, even if that time never comes, i will await you forever, because some things are worth waiting for, even if they never do come to pass.'  ...so were his parting words to her",

        "blog_text": "I live in a Pakistani/Muslim/American society…quite interesting as it may be, combining two cultures and practicing a powerful religion all together… I would say it is rather difficult to do, trying to live as an American, being true to my heritage, and staying the path that my God has set before me. The dilemma is more along the lines of the conflict of American and Pakistani society than anything to do with Islam. Although the “rules” that I have been taught seem to be a combination of religion and culture and the line is so blurred that I cannot tell the difference between what is and what is not culture and what is and what is not religion. Unfortunately at times it looks all the same to me.  Perhaps I am articulating thoughts that all people have, considering the whole world seems to be a mesh of difference societies and religions. But I think that I'm not cut from the same mold as my peers. My close friends and loved ones don’t think like I do; not that any two people think exactly alike but I think so differently than my friends or anyone I know for that matter that it’s a little scary. The majority of Muslims that I talk to or know well do not think like I do. It is scary to me because I wonder why haven’t I bought into the system like everyone else ? Why cant I accept the shortcomings of our society and the difficulties of our Faith like everyone else? Why do I find so much to criticize? While my friends find it easy to follow the rules set by society that govern how they live, how they study, even how they love…I find fault with all of it…I am so frustrated by the binds that this society puts not only on myself but people around me that sometimes I wish I could run away from it all. Unfortunately I cannot do that. As easy as that sounds I would have to give up the things that are of paramount importance in my life. My family, my friends, my fiancée. It’s the love and compassion that these people give me that keeps me in this society. They are probably the only reason I deal with and put with the bullshit of this society and trust me there is a ton of bullshit in this society.  So here is my dilemma: I do not wish to give up my family friends and my love but sometimes the bullshit of this society lights a fire of fury inside me that at times cannot be contained. I do not know which one to choose, my loved ones or choosing to rebel against this society. I fear that if I choose to silence my frustrations and criticisms then those thoughts will fester inside and eventually cause such a mess that nothing will be able to clean it up. But if I cultivate these thoughts, then I worry that my heart and mind will tell me to move away from the things that hurt me. And the worst party is that my loved ones are eternally bound up in the very thing that gives me so much anger. They have issue with society but they seem to put their problems to rest of at the very least they silence their objections so that they can live and function in this society. I cannot silence these objections; I cannot put these problems to rest. These problems have ruined too many lives and I speak only of those lives that I have seen before my very eyes be destroyed because of this society and this society only. I have friends who live everyday in small hells because of this society’s ridiculous traditions and customs. I have friends who have lost hope that they will find love because this society would not allow them to be together; despite the fact that both of them are at appropriate ages and in good situations to be married. How can so many people live in such a society that forces the suppression of emotions to the point at which people literally become numb to their emotions?  What is more frustrating than anything else is the fact that most people who I talk to those to whom I express these doubts, frustrations, and fears…they dismiss them as the useless ramblings of a growing adult or as insanity that should simply not be acknowledged. They do not respect these thoughts as being legitimate, they simply say well that’s just the way things are; you have to accept them. They say, you cannot escape society because if you do you will have to turn your back on everything you know and everyone you love. Almost as if they are trying to force me to stay by scaring me. By threatening the loss of my loved ones they think that I will stop thinking this way and fall in line like the rest of the army ants. But no amount of threats will keep me from thinking…regardless of what those thoughts are nothing will keep me from thinking about the things that inspire, disturb, or enlighten me. As good as that sounds it is rather saddening because so many people respond to my thoughts and ideas in anger and disgust or with a lecture about how I am simply not religious enough. If I was a better Muslim then I wouldn’t have these issues. And that if I devote myself more to my faith then everything will be ok because once I envelope myself in something with complete blind faith so as to silence my questions then my soul will feel justified or somehow content with the horrible reality that is our society.",

I stood up when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady beaming up at me with a smile that lit up her entire being. She said, 'Hi handsome. My name is Rose. I'm eighty-seven years old. Can I give you a hug?' I laughed and enthusiastically  responded, 'Of course you can!' and she gave me a giant squeeze. 'Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?' I asked. She jokingly replied, 'I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married, have a couple of children, and then retire and travel.' 'No seriously,' I asked. I was curious what may have motivated her to be taking on this challenge at her age. 'I always dreamed of having a college education and now I'm getting one!' she told me. After class we walked to the student union building and shared a chocolate milkshake. We became instant friends. Every day for the next three months we would leave class together and talk nonstop. I was always mesmerized listening to this 'time machine' as she shared her wisdom and experience with me. Over the course of the year Rose became a campus icon and she easily made friends wherever she went. She loved to dress up and she reveled in the attention bestowed upon her from the other students. She was living it up. At the end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet. I'll never forget what she taught us. She was introduced and stepped up to the podium. As she began to deliver her prepared speech, she dropped all of her 3 x 5 note cards. Frustrated and a little embarrassed she leaned into the microphone and simply said, 'I'm sorry I'm so jittery.  I gave up beer for Lent and this whiskey is killing me! I'll never get my speech back in order so let me just tell you what I know.' As we laughed she cleared her throat and began, 'We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow old because we stop playing. There are only four secrets to staying young, being happy, and achieving success. You have to laugh and find humor every day. You've got to have a dream. When you lose your dreams, you die. We have so many people walking around who are dead and don't even know it! There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up. If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and don't do one  productive thing, you will turn twenty years old. If I am eighty-seven years old and live life to it's fullest each day to achieve my dreams, I will turn eighty-eight. Anybody can grow older. That doesn't take any talent or ability. The idea is to grow up by always finding the opportunity in change. Have no regrets. The elderly rarely have regrets for the things we did, but rather for things we did not do. The only people who fear death are those with regrets.' She concluded her speech by courageously singing 'The Rose.' She challenged each of us to study the lyrics. At the years end Rose finished the college degree she had begun all those years ago. One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep. Over two thousand college students attended her funeral -  a tribute to the wonderful woman who taught by  example that it's never too late to be all you can possibly be.",

Happy as I am now, and as inappropriate as it is to post this on a public site, it shivers me to remember what my mental state was like a mere 8 months ago. Imagine what it is like to walk into a room and fall victim to the unrepentant and systematic torment that is the locusts of your class 'mates'; and just maybe you could see a glimmer of what my life was like. You hasten and begin to think that the people you inhabit school are the archetype of humanity, forgetting the fresh breeze of multicultural, such is the rigor and stiffness of the regime and people, that is Halliford.  I was young in every sense of the word there. Maybe I was never naturally inclined to be a private school boy, or maybe I'm just stubborn I'm never quite sure, but I hated the 6 years I spent in the abyss there. I have my limits, and I'm not going to ever tell too much information about my implosion into excrement within the dying embers of my time there, however if you would like a clue: I trusted people I shouldn't, and provoked flames in people who had been looking for the excuse against me for years. I can't say I'm completely fault-ridden I've done some and made some God awful catastrophe's, but even in my mind, what I went through was largely unjust. I've learnt not to dwell on the past, but I'll never relieve myself of the bitter taste that pollutes my saliva whenever the thoughts of them come to mind.  I came very close to ending it all. Maybe none of you realise it and never will, but luck, my nephews envisaged crying face, and the bottom of my mental stability saved me. Standing on top of the block of flats near the precinct, thinking jump and realising that it can't get lower than being on top of here where so many other people have jumped from in the past.  I built a fortress and I became rather bedridden the preceding summer, but at least there was a genuine look at short term hope. I went to Esher and the rest is history. It's not worth saying any more, I just get resentful and bitter at everything.

        "blog_text": "1202, Gombak. Dear Blog, I did something that I never thought I would have the guts doing. I took the box hidden under my table, and opened it. There they were, bundles of letters, each carefully folded. The box was full of letters from him, back when we were in college. Best of friends, we were. Me, him and N. Never went anywhere without each other. We would meet almost every night at the counselling room (we were kind of like PRS, but weirdly, we never had the chance to actually counsel anyone) and 'studied'. Talking and bitching was more like it. We were so close that people thought N and I were fighting over him. Yeah, right. The narrow-minded ones did not like us girls hanging out with this guy. You're not supposed to do that, they say. We were in the same class, and chatted everytime we had the chance to. We even wrote letters to each other when we were bored during lessons. We would exchange letters every two days or so (more often if the mood was good), just writing about things in general. What we did in the evening, what we thought about that particular Nazi-ish warden, relationships, friendships, what we were planning to do that weekend. All sort of things. There were little bounderies as to what we could tell each other. I would lie on my stomach, on my bed, and started writing away my worries, feelings and hopes. It only took us 3 months to really get to know each other, and the rest was history as they say. There was nothing that anyone could do to separate us. With one exception. Rumours were going around that we were an item. N was spared as she was seeing someone at that time. I did not like that. To me, it was just a very special friendship. Nothing more. And I backed off for a while, which I later regret. It was one of the 'challenges' we went through as friends, but we pulled through it. He's the only one I know who calls me Ash. That or Zona Pellucida. I liked it. It was special. The night we broke up, he said 'Zana...'. I knew it was over even before he finished his sentence. He used to sign off his letters with 'Luv, bro'. Once in a while it was 'Devil #1' (some not-very-funny joke we had). Or just simply his name. Sitting here with the box on my lap, I'm still thinking of what I should do with the letters. I used to read the letters over and over again whenever I came back home, and they never failed to bring a smile across my face. It brings back fond memories from those years in Banting. Those letters were one of the few things that kept me sane while I was there. That and a few special friends that I still treasure. I tried reading some of them, but this time, instead of the warm feeling I usually get, there was nothing. Zilch. I did not feel a thing. No happy thoughts, no regrets. No anger. I was half-expecting myself to cry. But I didn't. I guess it's time to really move on. And get rid of them. I shouldn't hold on to these, should I? Part of me feels sad that I have to do this. What else can I keep from my college years if I don't have these letters? But some things aren't meant to be. And maybe I should keep searching for that Banting yearbook that I misplaced somewhere.

(my point being, there is something to be gained from ALL experience and the amount to be gained is not directly proportional to the amount of participant interaction or 'free will' required.)  ANY activity you perform, from watching television, to painting a picture are limited in their scope. while it is true that television has fewer options (fewer ways to interact with the activity) painting is also limiting in it's options. you are limited by your skill level, the tools and mediums you are using, etc. what i mean to say is, it is not a limitless life experience. all activities fall somewhere different on the range of participant interaction, and i don't necessarily believe that just because one allows for MORE it is necessarily 'better' or 'more like being true'. i believe each can offer a different opportunity from the total experience of life.  i don't believe that if someone fills their life with less hours of television watching they've necessarily lead a more fulfilling or satisfying life. for the person who thinks looking out the window and thinking is a meaningless pursuit, and would prefer to play a video game, then looking out the window and thinking IS a 'waiting to die' type of activity FOR THEM.   i suppose the disagreement i have is in the 'waiting to die' vs. 'living life' distinction. you say 'living life' activities are 'first-hand experiences', but it seems to me that being a human being that experiences everything first-hand, 'waiting to die' activities (ie. watching television, playing card games) are equally as 'first-hand'. perhaps the rules of the specific activity are derivative (that is, invented by somebody else) but your experience and/or interpretation of them is yours. it IS first-hand. true, 'waiting to die' activities may involve less choice/interaction, but it falls within the same category as 'living life' activities (which are also constrained by rules, perhaps just less so).   basically what i am trying to say in a convoluted kind of way is that everyone differs in their interpretation of what is 'fulfilling'. what kinds of activities they find meaningful enough to pursue. what determines the value of an activity is totally subjective and relative to the person experiencing the activity, and i certainly do not believe in an absolute category of 'more fulfilling or meaningful' (ie. 'living life') vs. 'less fulfilling or meaningless' (ie. waiting to die). here is one example (and my idea is not solely related to intelligence level, just one type of way of illustrating my point): if you're a person with a 180 IQ, your meaningful activities are going to differ from somebody who is developmentally delayed. does that mean a person with diminished faculties is 'waiting to die' when they bounce a ball against a wall because they find it entertaining? just because they are don't find the same type of joy, for example, in writing a complex mathematical thesis? is it also possible that people who cannot find joy in painting, or writing, or thinking AND HAVE 180 IQ's are 'waiting to die' as well? somehow that just doesn't make sense to me. my point is, the same person with an 180 IQ who can easily contemplate the complexities of life, can derive an equal amount of pleasure/fulfillment/satisfaction bouncing a ball against the wall, or watching television, or playing a card game. it IS a different experience, but that's what so great about the TOTAL experience of life, the range of different activities one can participate in. not every activity may be limitless (or offer as many opportunities) in it's options and scope, but the amount of different activities we can choose to involve ourselves in, and thus partake in a full range of human experience, IS what makes one experience life, or allows them to be 'living life'.   i think the distinction between 'waiting to die' vs. 'living life' presents itself not in what activities you necessarily choose (specifics like watching tv vs. painting), but in not allowing yourself to fully engage in all the experiences that are possible, to what is available to you as the individual you are.

I then proceeded to make breakfast, and GASP even cleared my plate and put it in the dishwasher.  my mother, the fine woman that she is, then decided to call me on the telephone.  when I answered, she inquired as to whether it would be to my liking if we went to the first ever farmers market in Bellevue, and then went to her work so I could help her.  normally, I would weigh these 2 options, the 2 options being  a.  staying at home; which consists of: -watching TV -a lot of aim  -web surfing  -masturbation  -and the like and b. going to my mothers work, which would involve none of the previously described hedonistic activities, and would result in me doing crafts meant for 6 year olds to see if they would work for her 'customers', but don’t forget,  today, today my friends, was different.  so, it was with those fleeting images that I meekly agreed to dress myself, change my diabetes supplies and turn off the computer, and venture out into the unknown.  when I arrived, I tried to be as courteous as possible  “mother, can I help with this or that?”  I carried back all of her bags from the farmers market and placed them ever-so gently into her trunk, then proceeding onto her work, I spent 3 hours making tissue paper flowers to make sure that they were not hard for the children  when this was done, I came home.  but  just when I thought my trials and tribulations were over, I was summoned again  this time it was to give the dog fresh water  no, never mind the fact that you are four feet away and could fill it up yourself, it is much more efficient for you to summon your son, who is located 1 story and a flight of stairs below you, to do said deed  and I obliged, I came up and filled that water dish to the best of my abilities. not 1 drop was spilled, and it was placed back on the ground with grace not seen in times like today well, continuing on my courteous kick, I asked if the table had been set  why no, my mom replied, a smug grin invading her upper facial region  well I said, maybe I should do that then  maybe you should she said  so I remove the utensils from their respective drawers, fold the napkins and pour the beverages.  it is at this point, with my task completed, that my mom tells me that she wished to dine outside on the deck  this poses a conundrum the outside table, left unused for the winter  has acquired what many would refer to as 'filth'  thus, it was unfit for food to be consumed upon but, do not let that worry you; of course it would be my delight to spend 1 half hour in the blazing sun wiping that table off, and then resetting it  with all that done and accounted for, I was, mad, yet satisfied with my efforts  wanting to face the trees, I asked my brother if I could have the spot that overlooked our yard  this request was met with a 'Sam I really want to sit there too, sorry, should’ve asked sooner'  yes Nate, whatever you please.  when I was done  I cleared his plate, and my mothers, and everything that was out on the table  I then put everything in the dishwasher  I then ran the dishwasher  at this point  I was heated  and retreated back to my room to escape from the retardedness of my family but wait it gets better after thinking about it for a while I realized that not once during the entire day had anyone thanked me for giving up my time to help them : whether it was at my mom's work, or through my tireless kitchen chores I thank my mom when she does the slightest thing but no, a simple, thanks Sam is too much to muster after an hour of being removed from the situation I am summoned once again this time by my father who had just arrived home from Chicago there was no hello son or, my trip was grand, was your day swell? no, I was greeted with a 'Sam, sit down' I proceeded to park my derriere in a seat at the dining room table  which still possessed the placemats I had set upon it just a few hours earlier for the next 20 minutes I was inundated with reasons why I wasn’t good enough, especially concerning my grades this left me speechless I had worked my ass off in every one of those classes I had raised all my grades to b's, except in Spanish, in which the teacher specifically said that I had been working just as hard, and just wasn’t getting it now, if anyone else had said this to me my mother, for example anyone other than my father I would’ve ripped into them I would’ve yelled like there was no tomorrow no, but here I sat listening to my father telling me that I wasn’t someone that colleges want the only words I spoke during this verbal tirade were  'dad, um, I'm in 9th grade?' his response to this was impressive as I sat there, and watched him yell at me about disrespect, laziness, how the test scores must be wrong because they say I’m smart, and to him I’m a dumb fuck I bit my lip the entire time and it bled by the end at the end of his performance he asked me Sam I’m not mad at you a single tear dripped down my cheek Sam, I’m not mad, I just want you to understand that you need to try harder.  I’m not asking you to get straight a's I’m asking you to get b's, b+'s, a-'s, that sort of thing so Sam does it make sense? I shook my head and said no, and left the table as I left he yelled come back her goddammit I want to talk to you no I’m not coming back dad and I’m not an angry adolescent you're just a fucked up old man no there was no mention of  1- Sam pulled up 3 of his grades 2- there’s three paragraphs in my history comment about how nice I am to other people about how honest and courteous I am no he took the only nice point in the English comment that I am quick with words and told me it was because I was dumb it was all I had to rely on so dad, I’m through well 2 hours later instead of him coming down to talk to me he yells at me from the stairs Sam come up here you need to do a blood sugar test ok ill do one later no you will do one know fine so  I get up I comply I walk past him as I enter the kitchen 'Sam, I want you to know that I said that because I love you' silence  'and that I said it because I felt that this is a time for you to make changes' silence 'Sam, give me a hug' he reaches in to give me a hug 'dad, I don’t have to give you a hug' Sam come back here and give me a hug dammit no I didn’t I just walked out of the room so dad how was your trip? and that’s it that’s how I feel about life",

When my father asked for a hug to make peace, I couldn’t bring myself to comply because it felt insincere and dismissive of how much pain his earlier words had caused me.

        "blog_text": "Fuck That Flag  A short story by the mutant.  This is a true story, or so I have been led to believe. It was told to the mutant by his friend 'Jack'. Jack related the story to me during our discussion of the mental illness we have all come to know as 'flag worship'.  I should mention that my friend Jack is an accomplished liar, given to exaggeration of details, so he may have made it all up on the spot.  Jack is a mechanic. He works for a company that owns a fleet of vehicles and heavy equipment. He keeps the machinery running and he likes his job. Jack is fighting terrorism his way.  A few days before the anniversary of 9/11, Jack was approached by his employer with a nice new American flag.  'Jack, I just bought a flag.'  Jack peered at the nice new clean flag from beneath a layer of grease and dirt, 'I am happy for you. What does this mean to me?'  'You are the mechanic,' says the employer, in the way that employers do when what they are saying flys solidly into the face of logic. 'Can you build us a flagpole?'  'Yeah, I suppose I could. But it will take time away from working on our vehicles. I am not doing this on my own time.'  'Of course.'  And so, Jack set off to build a flagpole. Jack is a mechanic mind you, he is not a flagpole engineer. He has other things to do, important things that generate income for his company. But he got on with it anyway.  Jack computed the availability of basic materials on hand, those that had to be purchased, the location selected for the pole atop the building, the size of the flag, how much time this project would detract from his regular cash-producing duties, lightning, low-flying aircraft, rabid bats, what he could get away with, and so forth. Based on these figures, Jack produced a flagpole atop the office. Old Glory fluttered in the breeze. Sighting it from the relative safety of his garage, Jack puffed with satisfaction on his Marlboro.  But all was not well my friends. No. For as we shall see, a horrible sickness began to take hold of the office workers.  In the vocabulary of flagpole engineers, people whose life work is the study of upright cylinders crowned with a loop of rope and and pulleys and the ability of said structures to loft a brightly colored cloth into high visibily, Jack's flagpole was 'half-assed', a first year student's attempt at an art form best left to professionals. The office dwellers complained to Jack that when there was little wind, a tiny bit of the drooping colors scraped against the roof, fraying the edge of the flag.  'It's not that bad,' says Jack. 'No one can see that, it still looks OK.'  'It's a brand new flag. It has to come down until you make the pole higher,' says the employer.  'That will cost more money and more time. An extension will have to be added to the pole. And I will have to build a new bracket.'  'That's fine, do whatever you need to do.'  And so Jack removed the flagpole from the roof, built a new bracket to hold an extension, and remounted the pole to the roof. Satisfied with his work, Jack returned to his garage to find something really greasy and dirty and profitable to work on.  The flagpole looked good, the office dwellers all agreed, and they cheered Jack's accomplishment, they glowed with patriotism, and the sickness, moved in with them.  'Jack, can you mount some lights under the flag so it can be seen it at night?'  'Who is that going to impress?' says Jack from behind a cloud of smoke that was once a flagpole-like cylinder of selected fine tobacco.  'What?' The sickness affects hearing first. 'We should have lights shine on our flagpole. Can you do that?'  I'll kill this shit thinks Jack, 'Yeah, but we should really have our electrician do that sort of work.'  'That's OK.'  'Is it? The electrician has to come out of the city. It will cost more time and more money.'  The increasingly larger dollar signs had still not yet registered in the employer's brain, 'Money is not the issue. Do whatever you need to do.'  Jack contacted the electrician and an appointment was set. In the meantime, high winds during a storm broke the bracket and sent the top half of the pole, flag and all, crashing down to the roof. A mournful wail erupted from the sickened office workers. The peaceful nastiness of Jack's garage was once again shattered.  Jack's employer gave up on the whole project, by passing the responsiblity on to the office manager. By this time, the sickness was in full bloom. The office worker's need for the flag had grown beyond normal boundaries. It was the crack-pipe of patriotism, around which they all rallied. They needed more.  The office manager confronted Jack, 'We want to erect a new flagpole. How soon can you get it up there?'  'Look, as long as we keep mounting it to the roof it's going to be a problem. We will have to weld it. Our welder will have to weld the poles and we'll have to mount it on the roof very securely. We are talking about a very difficult job, more money, more time, and it will continue to be a problem. We need to bail on this deal. This flag is a bad idea. It has been nothing but trouble.'  The manager conveyed the news to the office workers, but the sickness was undeterred. They decided to instead erect the pole in the front parking lot. And they still wanted lights to shine up on the flag.  And so it was that Jack removed the flagpole and sought out the assistance of the welder, who is a marine corps veteran.  An interesting side-note, the welder is eighty years old, he was told by a gypsy fortune-teller when he was a child that he would die on his twenty-first birthday. This is no problem he thought, I just won't be anywhere dangerous on that day. But the welder was a marine, and as fate would have it, on his twenty-first birthday, he was face-down on the beach at Okinawa, with bombs and machine-gun bullets and parts of bodies flying all around him, and all he could think about was that fucking gypsy. He's done his part for his country. And now he has to deal with sick people who cannot begin to guess at what patriotism really is.  The welder agrees to help out, but new materials are needed. The poles Jack has been using on the roof won't do.  Being a veteran, he points out that if they erect a pole of this kind, the flag must be raised in the morning and lowered in the evening. It must then be folded into a triangle. And what's more, because the flag has touched the ground, it has been desecrated, and must be burned.  Jack thinks this is fine idea. Jack thinks that this is the best idea he has heard in a long time. Indeed, burning the flag, this flag, would give him a positive hard-on. His brain erupts in visions of the flag and the office building consumed with flames, workers running to and fro within, helpless, unable to escape, and himself, watching from his garage, reassembling a carburetor, whistling a happy gospel tune.  Jack is on his way to the trash burning spot with the flag in one hand and a can of kerosene in the other, the word goes out across the yard, and the crew rushes to stop him.  The welder goes on to explain that the flag cannot simply be burned in order to cast out the evil spirits. No. They must take the flag to the VFW Hall. There they will arrange a ceremony complete with uniforms, guns, a bugler to play taps, a chaplain, an altar, a pentagram, a virgin girl scout to sacrifice, and so on. Flag burning, as with flag ownership, and flag display, implies a lot of silly-assed rules and ceremonies so it seems.  The welder took the flag with him to the VFW Hall, so if you don't get the girl scout cookies you ordered this year, now you know why. Sickness takes a toll.  Soon thereafter, Jack is called into an office meeting. He stubbs his cigarette out at the door before entering, but he keeps it, unlit, dangling out of his mouth. Jack is particularly greasy today, approaching pure nasty. As he takes his seat among his co-workers, he is the portrait of someone who whose time is being wasted at faster-than-light speed.  'What is this all about? I'm busy,' he grumbles.  'We need to decide who is going to raise and lower the flag,' says the office manager.  'What flag?'  'This is important. We need to decide how this will be handled.'  'Do I have this right? I had to stop working to come into a meeting to decide who will raise the flag that we do not have on the flagpole that we also do not have?'  The office manager can't take it anymore, 'Can I see you in here for a moment?'  They go into a private office.  'Geez Jack, what are you a communist?'  'No. I am a nazi.'  'Oh God, Jack, don't say things like that. People don't think that kind of talk is funny.'  'Ja, I am really.'  'Look Jack, it's just a little flag.'  'No. If I have a little flag on a wooden stick,' waving his unlit cigarette to demonstrate, 'That is a little flag. You are holding a meeting for something that does not exist. I have a transmission scattered out across the garage in ten-thousand pieces that has to be reassembled and working to do a job at eight AM tomorrow that will make money for the company which is what we are all here to do.'  'I get it, OK. Go.'  And go he did. The manager returned to the meeting, 'I don't know. I guess he's just un-patriotic...'  Indeed. I am Jack's complete lack of patriotism.  The sickness swept across the company, and with it now came the labels, 'Jack is un-american. Jack is a communist. Must be a democrat. Child abuse, I heard. A satanist...' They just could not understand it. Why would anyone hate the flag so much?  Thou shalt have no other god before me. Unless it's the flag. Amen.  Jack is approached by his employer, who has quite wrongly determined that he can bring Jack back into the fold. Jack decides to snap his boss back into reality.  'How much money have you spent on this flag deal?'  'Well, the flag was a hundred dollars.'  'And you have paid me over two days wages to deal with the flag.'  The boss can't believe this, 'It can't be that much.' Sick people can't count.  'Go figure.'  He did. The boss figures he has spent almost four-hundred dollars on a flagpole that he does not have, for a flag that he does not have. Isn't that special?  Now. The electrician. Remember the electrician? The electrician has arrived to put lights on the roof to shine up on the flag, the flag that isn't there, on the flagpole, that also isn't there.  Jack had fun explaining to the electrician that there was not, in fact, any flagpole, and that the flag had, in fact, been burned in some bizarre ritual at the VFW Hall. He also advised him that if these people didn't get a new flag soon there might be trouble, so he should watch his ass.  The office manager had fun trying to explain where the flagpole would be, and where the lights that will shine up on the flag will go. Since they did not know how high the pole would be, the lights had to be highly adjustable. He also asked the electrician to put a timer on the lights since it was determined in yet another office meeting that nobody wanted to be bothered to turn the lights on and off manually, let alone raise and lower the flag. Sickness causes laziness.  The electrician had fun presenting his estimate for the work that had to be done. And in descibing how much of the the lot must be dug up to install pipes to carry the wires to power the lights. No doubt, he also had fun telling his co-workers about these hillbillies he went out to give an estimate to that day.  Since the company had its own equipment for digging ditches, all the electrician had to do at this point was mark out where the pipes would be laid, avoiding gas lines, phone lines, and so on, and return when they were ready.  Enter the boss's idiot son.  The boss's son has never operated a ditcher. But since this work was on company property, now was his opportunity to learn. Are you getting ahead of me yet?  So he's running the ditcher. Once it starts it's pretty well automatic and only needs to be turned when neccessary. Jack and his co-workers note that the little boss is coloring outside the lines a bit.  'The line turns back there,' Jack yells over the machine noise, 'Don't you need to turn the ditcher now?'  'Yeah, I'm going to turn it over here, in a minute.'  Jack knew better and walked over to the ditcher to turn it. Just then, there was a flash of light and a hell of a noise. Sparks and pipes and wiring shot out of the ditch.  The power goes out at the office, and the apartment complex next door, and the convienience store and the strip center nearby. The phones aren't working either. No cable tv. And all eight-hundred feet of the DSL fiber-optic cable, all the way back to the junction box, has been ripped out and wrapped around the ditcher's impeller.   Now, power and phone services are easy enough to repair, but the DSL cannot easily be fixed. The repairmen do not know where the pipes are exactly, so, for two weeks they dig ditches up and down both sides of the road looking for them. And then a few days more while they dry out the pipes with nitrogen.  Meanwhile, the company cannot do billing because the DSL is down, (don't ask me why). So, no money coming in.  The computer guy resorts to stealing the modem out of Jack's computer, the only one with a modem, to build a proxy and get everyone back online.  Once the crisis had passed, Jack inquired of his employer what the situation with the flag was. Jack is funny that way.  'Fuck that flag,' the boss said.  It is estimated that the company was now into the flag for over three-thousand dollars.  Three-thousand dollars. For a flag they didn't have. On a flagpole they also didn't have.  Is there a point to my story? Well, fuck if I know, you people expect a lot when you click that little mouse don't you?  We were talking about sickness. When illness stikes, the body tries to expell it however it can. Sneeze it out, cough it out, sweat it out.  The mental illness of 'flag worship' is different. Only a really good beating will get it out of your system.  Well anyway, that's Jack's prescription.  ---The Happy Ending---  Jack was going through some old toolboxes and found a set of stickers. He went through the office passing them out.  'One for you, and one for you...' he sang as he went along.  He reached the office manager with the last one, 'And one for you...'  'All right! I know just where to put it,' said the office manager, slapping the American flag sticker on the side of his computer monitor. 'That's great!'  Indeed it was. And pretty strange behavior for a communist too, don't you think?",

        "blog_text": "I am back at school again. It is my last semester. Then life. Whatever that means.  I have had a busy break, very busy, but then again busyness is the defining factor of our culture, so I guess I am just living as I should. After a wonderful time in North Carolina visiting family I returned to Syracuse to pack and then get on a bus to go to Illinois for a massive convention called Urbana (check www.urbana.org for more info) Urbana was a wonderfully challenging missions convention. The speakers urged and challenged me and encouraged my faith. Urbana also gave me the opportunity to talk with one of my Xs and find some deeply need closure, I thank her dearly for that. Some background; on this… George (I’ve changed her name for her protection) and I dated for almost two years while I was at my first college (that was when I was 20 to 21.) She is an exceptionally sweet girl, and I care for her greatly. She was also the first girl I dated in a Christian context. We decided that we would strive to maintain each other’s purity and guarded ourselves from sexual sin. We decided we would not even kiss. We did this for the entirety of the time we were dating. I think it has to have been the most health relationship I have had to date. Our communication, conflict resolution, and just about everything else was amazing. The relationship was getting serious.   Now I’m sure you thinking “Why? That sounds like it was perfect, why did you break up with her?!” Well I was getting ready to leave for a semester to study in Latin America (Costa Rica mostly) and I got to thinking about how much traveling means to me, how I want to spend a large chunk of my life on foreign soils. I was talking with my dad about my trip and he said “What about George? What happens to here when you find some great Amazonian woman?” I was kind of shocked and this statement, but brushed it off. Later that day I was at my good friend Dan’s house and he said “What about George? She isn’t going to be able to keep up with your wanderlust? Are you going to let her hold you back?” Now this was weird. Never in all the time George and I dated did either of them say anything about this. And then in one day, a couple hours even both said pretty much the same thing. Scary. I trust both of them greatly for their advice and have for years so I had to think about this. I believe that if you are dating it is with the intention of getting married, well seeing if you should get married, not just for pleasure. When I think about the woman who I would like to marry there are several things I look for; one of them is that her and I have compatible life goals. Instantly it flooded through my head how many times I had asked her “When are you going to be ready to come travel, and adventure with me?” then I remembered how many times she would ask “How long is it going to take for you to get the travel thing out of your system and settle down?” Aaaahhhhh my perfect relationship, well isn’t!   I was going to leave in a few days and would not be back for months, not an idea situation to think about breaking up with someone to say the least. I had three days till I would see George and say good-bye. I took this time to pray and meditate on God’s will. I wasn’t positive as to what I should do, but I saw only three possible choices. 1.Break up now, face to face, the respectfully way to do it. 2.Wait, think it over more, then if still break up then I could send a letter (I was not going to have access to a phone while I was away) 3.Wait, think it over more, then if still break up then I would wait till I got back and tell her. Making her wait for three months just to dump her.   Of the three options I felt the first was the best and most respectful way to do it if I was going to. After extensive prayer God was pointing towards the fact this relationship was not meant to be. I was trying to change her in to something she wasn’t, and she was also trying to do the same to me. I still cared for her greatly, I didn’t want to do it. But I buckled down and did it anyway. It hurt, it hurt so bad. I felt so guilty, I hurt her, I didn’t want to but I did. I would rather be dumped any day then have to dump someone. Getting dumped is easy, you get angry, and then get over it. When you dump you feel guilty, you have doubt, you feel responsible.  So I packed and then I left. I left to grieve in another place, with other people.   I didn’t hate her, I didn’t want to never see her again. In fact I wanted to talk to her to know she was doing ok, to try and be her friend. While I was gone I sent her some letters telling her this. I think I was not clear enough on exactly what I wanted and I gave her the impression that I wanted to date again. When I came back home I called he to go and see her. When it became clear that I didn’t want to date again she got angry (she was always a feisty one) to say the least our relationship from then on was very strained and lead to further anger from her (justifiably so). I kept hoping and praying that she would get over it and then we could talk and be friendly. It didn’t happen. Me being there was preventing her from getting over me and healing properly. A year later she told me we couldn’t talk anymore. I understood why, but it felt… I felt empty. I didn’t know what to do, but I figured it would be best to give her, her space. This was last January.   Urbana marked the two-year anniversary of our break up. I found out from a mutual friend that she and I were both going to be going and would in fact have to get on the same bus to Illinois. My stomach was in knots. As it turned out there were enough people from upstate New York that there were three buses. She got on a different bus then I; so we didn’t talk then. Once there I lost everyone in the housing meat grinder (there were 20,000 people there) but as it turned out she was in the building next to mine and I would run into her on the street walking from one thing to the other. I ventured a “Hello” and a strained “Hello” was returned. We began to talk, cautiously. I asked her if we could sit down sometime as friends and just catch up, see how each other was doing, what is new, etc. We agreed on a time and place the next day.  In our talk we talked about many things and did a good job of keeping old emotions in check. It was not my intention, but our conversation wandered to the last days of our relationship. I told her what had happened (see above) and why. She had her suppositions about what had happened and wanted to know exactly. I guess it showed how hard it was for me to do it. She then told me she forgave me, that she understands why I did what I did, and more then that that she agrees with my choice; That I had done the right thing. I took a deep breath, I cried a couple tears holding back more. Tears of happiness.",

        "blog_text": "After months of trying, the call came.  'I can have a construction crew outside your door at 9:00am Monday morning.  All I need is the go-ahead and $1800 cash.  Is it a go?'    A go?  A go?!  I think.  My God, it's got to be a go.  I've spent months, months!, trying to find a contractor, real or fake, it didn't matter.   And now, a good one.  One I trust.  Ready to go.  It's got to be a go.  But is it?    All that stands between this go and me is 24 hours and a consensus.  The consensus of 24 households.  Consensus cannot be rushed.  Consensus cannot be urged.  Consensus must be found.  You see, I live in cohousing.  Southside Park Cohousing at the corner of 5th and T in downtown Sacramento.  An intentional community of 24 households, well 25 really, but one doesn't count.  The community operates by consensus.  Yes.  Don't play coy with me.  You know what that means.  You tried it once in your women's co-op, your recycling club or your group house.  It's everyone agrees.  No majority rule.  Every person has veto power.  It sucks.  Big time.  'Yes!' I say, brightly.  'It's a go.  Of course, it's a go.  We'll see you Monday.'  In a flash I'm off that line and onto another one.  How will I pull this off?  I've just got to.  I've been trying for over a year to develop a consensus around paving my neighbor's pathway behind her house.    She's disabled and rides a hand-operated bike or walks with crutches.   It's really tricky for her to negotiate the uneven dirt path.  I can't watch her go through this another week if we could do it now.  So it's off to the races.  I call two key households right away.  The ones that everyone calls to see what they think if there's a problem.  They're in.  Next I work the perennial naysayers.  I've got to get every single one of them neutralized or it's curtains.  It's going well.  I cross off household after household on my list.  After living with these people for years, you know things.  For example, you can't always let one member of the household speak for the other.  You can get the husband, assuming he brings the wife along.  And bob's your uncle, there's the wife showing up at the meeting threatening to blow the whole thing up.  Oops, I realize!  Even though we have the serendipity of a community meeting the next day where the decision can be legally made and even though I've gotten it onto the agenda in the last minute, there might not be a quorum!  I could get everyone ready.  Everyone on board.  And the thing fails for lack of a quorum.  Every lawyer's worst nightmare--win on the merits, fail on procedure.  A rooky mistake.  So, I call them back.  If they're not going to be there, I need a written proxy stating they're for the expenditure and they're for consensus without a quorum.    Now technically it's dicey;  if you don't have a quorum, you can't have consensus.  And if you don't have consensus, how to you consent to waive the quorum?   No matter.  I proceed at high speed. I corner them at the Earth Day festival, when they're relaxing on the lawn.  I corner them on their way to catch a plane to Europe.  I consider visiting one household member in the hospital, to get her to sign a proxy--something akin to wheeling in Strom Thurmond to break a filibuster.  'You should be a lobbyist,' one of the neighbors quips.  'No.  She should teach a class on lobbying,' another counters.  The two of them fall over with laughter at my expense.    Okay, I think.  Let them have their laugh. Sure, I'm a trained lawyer and lobbyist.  I've broken real filibusters in the U.S. Senate.  But I have nothing now.  I raise my kids.  I teach my little lobbying class.   Developing this consensus is likely to be my biggest personal political triumph of the year.  I.  Must.  Prevail.  But will I?  Tune in tomorrow night...",

        "blog_text": "Gay Dating and My Social Life Thus Far \nA not-so-mini essay by Ryan Zachary Hale \nWhat is it with the world today? Why the fuck is it so hard to find a boyfriend? Sure in the middle of West Virginia what can one expect; but can Shawnee, Kansas really be any better? Capital High School only has 1,400 kids, Shawnee Mission North is only 400 more. Is it even possible for there to be a cute/attractive, kind, loving,  available  gay senior? Hell, I'd take a junior. I'd even date from a different school, but how fucking cool would it be if I had a boyfriend at school? It would be like the gay power couple or something, especially if we didn't bother with hiding it. I'm not saying we have to make out in class, but people notice things, right? That's the thing, I don't want to look back on my last, my final, my  senior  year and regret any moment of it. I want to have my  first  boyfriend. I want to go to prom with him. I want to enjoy high school the way you see it on TV, and movies, and just walking around any school in America. Why does gay dating in high school have to be so hard? Straight people are always hooking up with one another and they're everywhere you look. Sure, the whole homophobia and violence around my sexual preference is a problem, but in these bigger schools do we really have to worry about such things?  I'm not trying to sound conceited or anything, but I'm damn cute. Sure, I'm not the most attractive person in the world, but we all can't be models now can we? I'm smart, funny, opinionated, loving, loyal, etc., so why, exactly, does everything seem to just not work? I've come a long way since 3 years ago as the new kid, the incoming freshman, from a middle school of 600 in Suburbia, USA to a high school of 3,200 in Evanston. Freshman year I didn't do that well in some classes. I missed work, didn't do projects, and got my first D on a grade report. It really jolted me awake, and I brought every grade up. I didn't have any friends, save for the occasional banter with people in class, and the few friends I had. I'm grateful I knew them. They are all fabulous. Notably the ones I still talk to: Alycia and Taylor: you guys rule. We have to visit sometime; I miss you. As for my other friends, I wish I still talked to them more or even talked to them at all after that first year. I made some more friends Sophomore year for sure, but basically kept the same group.  As I was talking with Mark  last night, I looked back at my two years at Evanston, and realized how depressing they were until the very, very end. I also remember the people who subconsciously made a difference in my life. I barely remember these people, and I haven't talked to them since my freshman Biology class. Sally, Sophia, and Evan. They were basically the only people I really talked to in that class. They just made me feel so at ease. They were honestly the first group of 'gay friends' I ever really knew. Before that I had no idea what these people were like. I thought that what I was feeling was some strange problem or something connected to the fact that I wasn't 'cool' or 'with the in-crowd' in middle school. Without them knowing, or even myself then, I started to realize who I am now. They were funny, and made me laugh, and were the most genuinely nice people you could meet. Evan especially just made you feel really comfortable. He was cute too. I realized that the first day I walked into the class, and I wish I had been able to accept myself then as I do now. For the longest time I had Sally's email, but I've lost it now. A Google search for her turns up nothing, but a Google search for Evan turns up what college he's going to. I know it's him, it's an Evanston address, and it says Evanston Township. I should email him just to say hi and see if he even remembers me, just for old times sake. I didn't realize he was a Junior when I was a Freshman, so I would have seen him my Sophomore year at least. Maybe I just don't remember. I feel like a bad friend now, you know? I need to talk to Alycia, and bad, and on the phone. She's the best girlfriend I've got, and she listens so well and would know what to do and even who I'm talking about even if I don't. She's amazing. No, she's fabulously divine. She's the first really-super-good-friend I came out to, and I'm proud of that. I could trust her with my life.  Moving onwards away from E-Town now. My sophomore year was uneventful and basically Freshman year with better classes and cooler classmates... I did make some new friends, like Nathan, and Jess, and Nate, but other than that the same old thing. Charleston was a new experience. I fit in quickly at Capital, thanks to the cool friends I've made here, and the fact that I was coming from a school almost 3 times it's size and from the big city, so I felt a little cocky about the whole thing. Junior year was great. Good grades, great fabulous friends, did well on the SAT, oh, and came out to others for the first time. I don't know if I would have done the same if I was still at Evanston. The atmosphere there was just so different, but I guess these things happen when we're ready for it. I got to know Mike, who's hilarious in his own quirky way and just has this way about him that you can't help but love. He's great with kids too, so he'll make an amazing teacher. I actually got out and did stuff. Tasha and Nikki were the other part of my trio of good friends here. We'd go see a movie just to check out the cute guys in it, or we'd go and spend a whole day at the mall walking around and having a blast or watching movies until 12:30 AM and having my mom come get me from Kanawha City without telling her where I was.  Despite my great year here in WV, and my amazing friends and experiences in Chicago, I still was never part of that clichéd popular social upper class that everyone yearns to be a part of at some point. I would kill to know the cool people and hang out with them and be in the know. I yearn for the spotlight and celebrity associated with it. You're self image takes shape as a child, and for me middle school was hell. I loved parts of it, but I was one of those kids that wasn't part of the popular group because I didn't play sports or have parents who made a certain amount of money or knew the same people since kindergarten. In a way middle school is more of a bitch than high school ever could be, just because it's so small and cliché. That kind of negativity stuck with me at E-Town, and I'm just now getting over it. Because none of the 'cool' kids never even wanted anything from you but a cheap laugh or an answer to the question they couldn't get because they were goofing off in class, I had this isolated anti-social mentality. I've learned to get over that in most situations, but everything comes back to dating. One gets this idea that you should just 'know what to do' when it comes to asking a guy out or that nervous first date and first kiss. Well life ain't so easy. In fact it's one of the hardest things to deal with. On top of the problems of normality preceding this sentence, you've got the more current issues to deal with. Today teenagers and early 20-somethings are too focused on the sexual aspects of it all. They don't want that romantic dating of decades past. They just want to find some girl to fuck or some guy to give it up to. I find it disgusting how there is not intimacy behind it all and it has become a game to some people. Not that I don't believe in sexual relationships, but don't fuck someone on the first date, or even the second or third. Wait until you really feel ready and right about it, and not listen to some guy who's gonna sweet-talk you into it by saying he loves you and crap. Some guys will say anything just to get you in bed. And when you do actually decide to do it, don't be stupid. Too many people have diseases these days for you to not use protection. You're saving yourself massive cost, humiliation, and health risks later on. You have so much to live for, so don't waste it on one poor decision.  This became much more than I intended. It was a rant on dating. Then it became a mini-therapy session for me. Then I started ranting about the problems of relationships. And frankly, I don't care. When I get in these moods I just need to vent. And in this case, the parts about me became a therapeutic experience. I may be talking to no one, or the world, but at least I got it out and I don't have to keep it all in my head. It's a good thing and it helps keep me sane.",

What was wrong with me...? Why was I waking up at night feeling a kind of dread...? I realise now, I was hearing the call...Simple. Same as Gautama the Buddha...he 'selfishly' left his devoted wife and son, because he couldn't not do it.   Most of us build our lives on sand. Mainly on two things: relationship, and career. If we loose either of these things, our world falls into a state of chaos...and can even collapse completely...It's a big trauma for most of us. So we usually hold on to these two things at all costs...relationship, and career. Meanwhile, life passes. I think that's the pain...that's the missing piece...we need a deeper meaning.   But we live in fear of life! Through the grace of my guru, I discovered that actually, life isn't out to get me! It loves me, actually! It loves us all! It is forever compassionate, it gives us the lessons we need, however hard they are to take, because in it's infinite wisdom, it wants us all to grow...to be at peace.   And Life is the greatest teacher...It's even more than that...it is god itself. Life is god. [That's why we can't see god...because it's in and around us all the time.] The basic human desire, as far as I can see, is for 'home'...for peace...for recognition of godliness.   And we assume that it can only happen on the physical plane. But the world is changing...and people are beginning to realise we have to look inwards for that which sustains us...it's not 'out there'....it's the love for yourself that you share.   I hope I made some sense and thanks for reading it !  Cheers,  Vijay Bhatter  @  Cyberax    References: 1.  The spirit of things   2.  Discovering Your Soul's Purpose",

WHEN. i dont know what they'll think, i dont really want to care. i just feel i should tell them myself, and so i will.   today i realised that i never really loved my parents enough. love was always a weird concept to me... i dunno who i love, whether i really truly love them, or whether it's just i felt bound to relation or something. but today, i really think. my parents are deserving people. i mean, they have their faults, and they're paranoid like any other parents are... the only thing they didnt deserve was this.   my parents think it's stress. the school thinks its peer pressure. i think it's just that i have stinking moral values, and a non-existant moral compass. i need to know what i really want, and what i really draw the line at. i've been too impulsive, too easy influence. i have a streak of pride and independence that i've always prided myself on, and this time, it got mixed up, and it went wrong. i've decided on one thing. if i'm ever going to do anything, i want to know that i can live with my decision from now on. i'll try not to do things on impulse, and exercise self-control. lol. u know what? i sound like those politically perfect people whom i've always loathed. nowadays everything i do, i end up questioning myself, and everything i see, hear, experience, i see it in a new perspective, and somehow, it relates back to what i have done and how i feel. now i know how they feel, and i wonder if they feel the same.  i've been quiet and different, i know, but this i do because i feel wobbly, unstable, unright, and i think i need to get back again, find who i am before i dare say that's me. im constantly questioning myself, and im trying to lie back and just... see first. i dunno. dont ask.   i think god must love me a lot, to make me learn the hard way. if i wasnt loved, i dont think i would have been caught, and then it would have just led to more and more, and the basic degeneration of my soul (not that it isnt polluted already). i have sinned much, not only in terms of this and it has made me wake up, realise my mistakes and it made me think. i was looking at izzy's qoutes (she has a lot =] ) and i came across this one by thorton wilder. it struck me.  'When god loves a creature, he wants the creature to know the highest happiness and the deepest misery. He wants them to know all being alive can bring.'  i dont think i've fully understood the meaning of being alive, but i hope that i can be a better person religiously.   on another note, i have the best friends any gurl could have. some of them dont understand, but i know they care anyway. and i'm touched. really. i love y'all [u know who u are =P]. and that's the best compliment u guys can receive, because i've never really told someone i loved them, and really meant it before. and i mean it this time =)   now i'm on an official and proper hiatus until after exams. damn the papers.",

        "blog_text": "My Type is INFP Introverted Intuitive Feeling Perceiving Strength of the preferences % 56 22 56 22 \nHealer Idealists are abstract in thought and speech, cooperative in striving for their ends, and informative and introverted in their interpersonal relations. Healer present a seemingly tranquil, and noticiably pleasant face to the world, and though to all appearances they might seem reserved, and even shy, on the inside they are anything but reserved, having a capacity for caring not always found in other types. They care deeply-indeed, passionately-about a few special persons or a favorite cause, and their fervent aim is to bring peace and integrity to their loved ones and the world. \nHealers have a profound sense of idealism derived from a strong personal morality, and they conceive of the world as an ethical, honorable place. Indeed, to understand Healers, we must understand their idealism as almost boundless and selfless, inspiring them to make extraordinary sacrifices for someone or something they believe in. The Healer is the Prince or Princess of fairytale, the King's Champion or Defender of the Faith, like Sir Galahad or Joan of Arc. Healers are found in only 1 percent of the general population, although, at times, their idealism leaves them feeling even more isolated from the rest of humanity. \nHealers seek unity in their lives, unity of body and mind, emotions and intellect, perhaps because they are likely to have a sense of inner division threaded through their lives, which comes from their often unhappy childhood. Healers live a fantasy-filled childhood, which, unfortunately, is discouraged or even punished by many parents. In a practical-minded family, required by their parents to be sociable and industrious in concrete ways, and also given down-to-earth siblings who conform to these parental expectations, Healers come to see themselves as ugly ducklings. Other types usually shrug off parental expectations that do not fit them, but not the Healers. Wishing to please their parents and siblings, but not knowing quite how to do it, they try to hide their differences, believing they are bad to be so fanciful, so unlike their more solid brothers and sisters. They wonder, some of them for the rest of their lives, whether they are OK. They are quite OK, just different from the rest of their family-swans reared in a family of ducks. Even so, to realize and really believe this is not easy for them. Deeply committed to the positive and the good, yet taught to believe there is evil in them, Healers can come to develop a certain fascination with the problem of good and evil, sacred and profane. Healers are drawn toward purity, but can become engrossed with the profane, continuously on the lookout for the wickedness that lurks within them. Then, when Healers believe thay have yielded to an impure temptation, they may be given to acts of self-sacrifice in atonement. Others seldom detect this inner turmoil, however, for the struggle between good and evil is within the Healer, who does not feel compelled to make the issue public. \nINFPs live primarily in a rich inner world of introverted Feeling. Being inward-turning, the natural attraction is away from world and toward essence and ideal. This introversion of dominant Feeling, receiving its data from extraverted intuition, must be the source of the quixotic nature of these usually gentle beings. Feeling is caught in the approach- avoidance bind between concern both for people and for All Creatures Great and Small, and a psycho-magnetic repulsion from the same. The 'object,' be it homo sapiens or a mere representation of an organism, is valued only to the degree that the object contains some measure of the inner Essence or greater Good. Doing a good deed, for example, may provide intrinsic satisfaction which is only secondary to the greater good of striking a blow against Man's Inhumanity to Mankind. \nExtraverted intuition faces outward, greeting the world on behalf of Feeling. What the observer usually sees is creativity with implied good will. Intuition spawns this type's philosophical bent and strengthens pattern perception. It combines as auxiliary with introverted Feeling and gives rise to unusual skill in both character development and fluency with language--a sound basis for the development of literary facility. If INTPs aspire to word mechanics, INFPs would be verbal artists. \nSensing is introverted and often invisible. This stealth function in the third position gives INFPs a natural inclination toward absent- mindedness and other-worldliness, however, Feeling's strong people awareness provides a balancing, mitigating effect. This introverted Sensing is somewhat categorical, a subdued version of SJ sensing. In the third position, however, it is easily overridden by the stronger functions. \nThe INFP may turn to inferior extraverted Thinking for help in focusing on externals and for closure. INFPs can even masquerade in their ESTJ business suit, but not without expending considerable energy. The inferior, problematic nature of Extraverted Thinking is its lack of context and proportion. Single impersonal facts may loom large or attain higher priority than more salient principles which are all but overlooked. \nFamous INFPs: \nHomer \nVirgil \nMary, mother of Jesus \nSt. John, the beloved disciple \nSt. Luke; physician, disciple, author \nWilliam Shakespeare, bard of Avon \nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow (Evangeline) \nA.

I know now that he tryed to pick up and that his phone wouldn't let him, he told me later, and Megan did, too, but at that moment I was really disappointed and I think he could hear that on the message I left him... I tryed not to sound too depressed, but I guess I'm not really good at it all the time, it only works sometimes.  Inthe afternoon mom and I sat around and were talking about a lot of stuff and I asked her if we could go and see Harry Potter III wtogether tonight, but she didn't have time. So she said that I should call Dino, one of my friends, 5 days younger than me, and I did. I didn't have a good feeling doing it and I was thinking about not going at all, but I had already stold mom that I would call Dino and I thought that anything would be better than trying to call Jon again and being depressed the whole day and stuff because I couldn't reach him. And so it came that Dino came over and my mom drove us to the movie theater.  I told Jon about this later and I think I really hurt him with it... Unfortunately the phone line broke down and his phone wsa dead and stuff, so I had to wait about 20 minutes until I could try calling him again.  20 minutes alone with myself, in the night, it was dark and my Gollum-voice was speaking to me... Oh, how I hate it. I'm really wondering if I'm not scizophrenic...is this normal?? Well, it was telling me that I should never have done it in the first place, even if I didn't have any bad intentions and for about a second it was telling me that I was right in doing it, because Jon didn't pick up the phone, but that had nothing to do with it, I swear. I'm just not the ind of person that hurts someone on purpose. And by hurting Jon I hurt myself even more. 'Gollum' was basicaly cussing me out the whole 20 minutes long, and whenever I think of that conversation on the phone I'm cursing myself. WHY on earth did I do it? WHY???  Why am I doing that to him? He really deserves something beter than me... I don't WANT to hurt him. I mean, how can I possibly ask him to trust me if I do stuff like this?  I hate myself, I really hate myself. I want to die... I don't deserve anything!!  I cant see how he can still love me... Anyways, when we talked again he apologiyed for overreacting on the phone (which he didn't, it's natural to act that way if you have to deal with such a stupid little girl like me) and said that everything is going to be okey. ... I still hate myself everytime I think about it, but I couldn't stand myself either if I hadn't told him. It's more a selfish thing than anything else, I had to tell him to ease mymind, otherwise I would have felt like lying to him and then Gollum would have been even meaner to me... What was I thinking when I went to the movies with DINO??? I wasn't thinking at all and that's my problem!! I'm horrible, I'm such a terrible person. I talked to him the whole night through and today, too, and I am a little better than yesterday night... I think he forgave me and now it's time to forgive myself, but I've still got a big problem with forgiving myself. I AM SO SORRY JON, please forgive me!!!  He said something else on the phone, long before I told im about the movie... or long after that... I don't know. He said 'Maybe I'm not the right one for you'. I don't remember what exactly we were talking about, but I think he was kidding. I really didn't like him saying that, it sounds too much like breaking up...  FCK IT ALL! I'M A DMN STUPID LITTLE GIRL! I DON'T DESERVE BEING HIS GIRLFRIEND! IF I'D GET WHAT I DESERVE I'D LIVE UNDER THE BRIDGE ALONE AND I'D GO TO HELL WHEN I DIE. I  WOULD  BE A 'TRIP TO HELL'!

Especially that pecan tart with shortbread (wow) crust.  Three:  stress over nothing.  Screw the holidays if they can't take a joke!    I've noticed in a couple of blogs a sense of frustration and anxiety over the holidays.  I'm sure part of that comes from working in retail-- it's the absolute worst time of the year to have to earn your living in the mall or any other place where frantic, glazed-eyed zombies search for an elusive 'perfect gift'.  Me, I just have to ignore students who didn't bother with their grade all semester but after it's totally too late to do anything about it, want to 'meet with me.'  Yeah, man.  I'll meet with you.  I hear that there's a cold front moving into Hell right now.  Just wait till it's there, and I'll arrange a quick little meeting for me to 'justify' you lame-o grade to you.  But heck, that is easy!  I just have to happily delete emails I'm not required to answer and ignore any phone messages.  I remember when the first George Bush was out of office, and some reporters were clamoring for some kind of comment on something, and he said 'I don't have to answer you people anymore.'  That's how I feel.    So anyway, I got distracted.  What I really wanted to discuss was Christmas. This year, I'm fairly okay with it.  Yes, I felt cranky and scrooge-like when it started being 'Christmas' at retail outlets shortly before frickin' Halloween.  And I don't like yard decorations.  And I have yet to try the gingerbread or eggnog lattes at Starbucks cause I don't want to be jonesin' for them the rest of the year when they're not available.  But all in all, I'm sort of looking forward to various aspects of the holiday season.  Andrew & I had a good time in Florida with the relatives there-- photos will be forthcoming eventually.  Some cool beach time was spent.  We traipsed around this very cool condo that's going up on the end of Pensacola beach pretending it was at all possible we were going to buy the million (yes, that's right) dollar penthouse condo.  Yes, it did have a really fabulous view.  It was cool!  But altogether, the condo felt a little 'retirement village'ish.  Even if there was a snowball's chance we could afford a million dollar condo.  (With three smallish bedrooms).  Today, I'm hosting the Christmas eve traditional San Antonio tamale feast.  And tomorrow, we'll drive out to the lake house to spend some time with extended family there.  There are even (gasp) possibly board games in the future.  If I could get everyone to wear the same sweater (preferably red, with a flashing reindeer nose on it) I might have to try.  It's all part of my evil plan to be happy instead of miserable, and so far, it's actually working.  The whole 'no-gifts-for-anyone-other-than-people-you-actually-know-something-about-buying-gifts-for' plan has worked admirably thus far.    Christmas doesn't have to be the commercial suck fest it often is.  It can be a time to hang out and eat good food, and hang out with those family members you don't want to throttle after ten minutes in the room.  But you do have to work at it.",

        "blog_text": "A rant of political ideas. I'm turning this essay in tomorrow for my comparitice politics course. The professor wanted to know our political beliefs. Values, ideologies, beliefs, mores, and prejudices. No political scientist should leave home without them. They represent the opinions, experiences, and criticisms that people have learned, taught, and created for themselves. Each word can carry a thousand different snapshots in time where a person understood something for a moment. A moment where all the confusion, ignorance, and fear were swept away and all that remained were simply truths, or at the very least perceived truths. For the purpose of organization, label these values, ideologies, beliefs, mores and prejudices into categories. It is doubtful, however, that any one person can fit all of their snapshots into the categories. That is why this paper isn’t titled “Tuesdays with Clinton” or “What Would Bill O’Reilly Do”. I have too many pictures. Although, the left box is much fuller than the right box. My lean towards the left side of politics comes from being a middle class kid with working class parents. They weren’t active in politics or even aware of politics, but the TV always stayed on the channel longer if a Kennedy was on the screen. When I was younger, being a democrat, or on the left was much easier. It was all about helping people. These people are poor and need money, and if other people were saying we shouldn’t give it to them, they seemed cruel and mean. The first thing taught in kindergarten is the ability to share. As age and education start to grow, the ability to back-up those impulses to help people become harder. Not everyone deserves help in everyone eyes. That’s when the arguments start and you realize that you have much to learn. Too much to learn. “What have you learned so far?” is what you’re asking me. I’ve learned that white people are still very afraid of black people. I’ve learned that the separation of church and state will be a constant battle. Ditto for abortion. I’ve learned that feminism has many different meanings, from bra burning, to achieving untold success in a man’s world, and somehow, feminism can mean flashing breasts for beads at a festival. I’ve learned that even the victims of genocide are willing to burn books. I don’t believe in being color-blind. When a person is color blind, they can still see the world, just skewed a little. Racism is still here. The past forty years on non-legislated segregation is just a drop in the bucket compared to centuries of violence and intolerance. White people seem to think that just because the drinking fountains are open to everyone that that somehow erases generations of pain and angst. Black folk have taken their labels and used them to empower themselves, and now they just want a fair shot, and for some unimaginable reason that scares the hell out of white people. White people claim to believe in an American Dream, or a melting pot. Nevertheless, every time a minority gets a step forward, there is cadre of white people there trying to knock them back a few steps. They use bibles against homosexuals. They use the “not my ancestors” excuse. They use acts of government to watch them attend their mosque. They use “research” to make women feel guilty about becoming professionals and not staying at home to raise babies. They use racial profiling. They use words like abomination, will of god, and “for the children” to try to keep their piles of money and land safe. One of the smaller tragedies of 9/11 is that my generation is longer referred to as the first in U.S. history that may do worse financially than its parents. We are now the 9/11 generation. The “Shock and Awe” generation. The War Against Terrorism generation. Does my upcoming bachelor’s degree mean anymore than a diploma these days? Does anyone realize that I have been socialized to go to college to get a “good job” instead of actually learning? The distance between rich and poor may only be the length across a mile road, but it also plunges far much deeper. My planet is dying, hormones in milk are making my daughter develop and become sexualized to early, the average life span for black makes is 25, Lieberman is trying to censor my videogames, my friends lost their financial aid because they got caught smoking pot, I’m overweight, TV tells me I’m not pretty enough, my grandmother can’t marry her girlfriend, you can’t smoke in New York, if I type the word “bomb” three federal agents get phone calls, there is an actual need for a gay high school, courts are deciding elections… and I am being told to watch out for suspicious looking brown men. I’ve learned that the face men aren’t important. That guy kissing babies trying to get me to think of the good ‘ol days? He means nothing. It’s the guy behind the guy that you have to either worry about or believe in, and I guess that’s why I’m a political science major. I don’t have grandiose visions of changing the world. I think people that tell me that the hippies stopped Vietnam are still hitting the pipe to hard, but I do think that if I can believe that what I am doing is right, I can bring myself to terms with all of these problems I have with government and the state of our world. I have difficulty calling myself left these days because of the way the right has been so successful at spinning liberal into a bad word. Nevertheless, being a part of this lost generation does give a push to quantify and organize myself into the labels of my parents, my grandparents, and my grandparents’ parents. I’m just not ready to yet. I think like most Americans I am looking for a third answer.",

        "blog_text": "So, I am going back blond... like litterally that is what I am doing as I write this.  I don't think beauty should be this painful... but let me tell ya, the bleach on my head BURNS!!!  I figured it was safe to do the whole blond thing again since I was off probation at work and the chances of me getting fired for it are pretty slim now.  Day before yesterday, in Charleston, SC, I was chatting with Andrew on the phone and watching QAF on Showtime, and after QAF was over Its My Party started... I told Andrew I couldn't watch it cuz I would get sucked in and watch the whole thing and cry and all that good shit.  So I changed the channel while I was still on the phone with him.  No sooner than I hang up from him, I decide I have to flip back to see where they are in the movie.  STUPID IDEA!!!  2 hours later I was on my bed crying like a bitch.  It is rare that a movie can do that to me... I mean I cry at movies all the time but usually when I watch them again, I pick them apart and the do nothing for me... This movie I have seen dozens of times and it is always good for a good sob... The only other movies that are like that for me are The Color Purple, The Imitation Of Life, and Steel Magnolia's.... Oh yeah, and Like Water For Chocolate....  This is however, the first time I have watched this since I got sick... I spent about 3 hours the next day examining the situation.  Could I or would I kill myself before I became a burden on my loved ones...  I decided if I were in the same situation as the character in the movie I would have done the exact same thing.  I never want to have my family and friends remember me as a vegetable, or my body so ravaged by illness that I can't take care of myself.  I want my friends and family to remember me when I am strong and mostly healthy...  I would also want a party right before I go, I want to go with all of my family (both chosen and not) around me.  I already decided Andrew will definately be my 'Margaret Cho' character in the movie... she has this role of a very caring friend who doesn't like that she is losing her best friend, but is totally there to support him and help grant his final wishes... through the whole movie, she does such a good job of not crying around Nick, but at the end, she lets him know how much he has meant to her, and vice versa.  Andrew would definately be the one next to my mother weeping...  Tony would be the character played by Balki (I can never remember his real name)  He is so outgoing and abrasive but so supportive of his friend.  The other roles would be filled in by the wonderful cast of friends that I have been so blessed to have in my life.  There have been times in my life when I didn't know if I would be able to go on, when it felt like life was just too much.... it is at those times that one of my friends have stepped in and carried me out of the hole that I was in.  Anyway, that is a VERY long time off... I will post more later...",

Watching it allows me to process my own fears about illness and mortality in a safe way, and reminds me of the powerful connections I have with my friends and family. It helps me reaffirm how I want to be remembered: surrounded by love and strength, not defined by sickness.

It seems to be the familiarity that hurts the most-when I look at him I know exactly how long his legs are, how he moves his hands when he's talking, and how he smiles up close. He was always so hurt and upset by the fact that I didn't seem to prioritize him after the breakup, and frankly, I didn't. I knew he was important but after years of spending time around him and dealing with the quirks and hurtful bits, I wasn't in a rush to go back. I thought often that he was someone I could let go of without trouble. The sadness of losing a closeness after I have spent time and effort developing it is always intense for me, although lessened if I found out the closeness wasn't what I thought it was. This was not the case at all with him. For whatever reason I couldn't stop loving him as a person, even though I fell out of love with him a long time ago. I have to fight not to call, even though there would be little for me to say except that I hope he's doing ok. I hate this sadness. I feel it makes me weak and worse, I don't understand it. Is codependency really this hard to break?  I'm struggling everyday with living in the now. It can keep my panic attacks and round and round thinking away, but I keep forgetting I have to practice it. Sometimes even when I practice it, it fails. Lately I've been feeling tired, my emotions have worn me out this weekend. I wish I could absorb life at a different pace. I tend to think ahead in great detail, imagining every possible outcome.

After I got off the phone with the nurse I cried for a little while.  Today I didn't go to work.  I've been trying to take some time to reflect a little and honestly I'm nervous about going back to the office and facing everyone.  I'm sure that they will all be supportive, but I'm sure it will be hard.  Today I painted my memory box and I'm about to do the really hard part and write the letter to my baby.

First of all Tammy, Tammy is an incredibly sweet, caring and compassionate woman that I'm fortunate enough to know because we work together.  She was blessed and pleasantly surprised earlier this year to find out that she was pregnant after going through a host of her own trials and sadness.  Her son will be born in November.  Tammy has been there for me from the time I decided to start her fitness program, to the time when Eric and I decided to start trying for a family, to the weeks of questions before I found out I was pregnant, to the day I told her I was pregnant, to the past two weeks of sadness and loss.  She's been a friend to listen and a shoulder to cry on.  She personally knows what I am going through and is a shining example of the joy that can be found after a loss.  I appreciate her every day and count myself lucky to have become her friend.  Secondly, is my best friend Samara.  I've known Samara since we met at a Christmas party almost 2 years ago.  We instantly clicked and have developed a deep friendship.  While Samara has not been through the same experience I am going through now, she has been beside me all the way and is there to listen when I need to share or offer advice or words of encouragement to try to keep my spirits lifted.  I spent the first evening after the news with Samara and her husband as Eric and I needed to get out of the house.  We have shared our secrets of the past and hopes for the future.  While this is something I never thought I'd have to deal with, she has been there to hold my hand.  My hope is that our friendship will last for a long time to come, if I am ever needed, I can be there to hold her hand too.",

        "blog_text": "Moving is an activity that will sure unearth memories. In the process of preparing to move, I have been going through stuff trying to throw or give away everything possible before the movers get here. I found a journal of things that happened when I was still married to a male and my boys were 2 and 4 years old. I will simply enter them here verbatim from my notes:  Family life just isn't what it's cracked up to be. Where's the deep and abiding sense of satisfaction? I have a deep and abiding sense of pain where Ben broke my ribs before he was even born. That was four and a half years ago. Arthritis has set in. Along with post-partum depression. I thought it would go away. Now I have Buster and double depression.  Trying to maintain the expressionless demeanor of the clinically depressed patient is hard with two criminally inclined children around. They keep doing things that force expressions onto my face. Like throwing kittens into the swimming pool. Or at each other. Kittens make effective weapons. Both children looked as if they'd been to war after the kitten battle.  Kids not only make me depressed, they make me feel stupid. One day I was chewing Ben out over some minor infraction or other when he suddenly cried out, as if in alarm, 'Mom, you've got hair on your lip!' When I tried to brush the offending wisp away, he scornfully said, 'Not  a  hair. HAIR! Like Dad. A  moustache!  The lecture was over. We had to make an emergency trip to WalMart for some moustache bleach.   Buster likes to hit people. I had told a friend how mean he was before she came to visit one day. She came for lunch and was utterly charmed by Buster. He told her she was pretty. He sat on her lap and said 'I like you.' He nestled his head into her shoulder and smiled a smile that would have made angels swoon. As my friend was leaving she commented how unjust I was to call this precious boy 'mean.' She spoke too soon. Buster had found a yardstick and whacked her across the butt with it right at THAT MOMENT. I was so vindicated!   I've tried many 'techniques' on these guys. One that is frequently recommended is simply ignoring them. I've experienced little success with this. For example, recently Buster was whining 'Mom, Mo-ooom, MOOOOOOOOOOOM.'  I ignored him. So he yells 'CONNIE, I'M TALKING TO YOU!' How do you ignore  that  from a two-year-old??  I nursed my babies. Nursing is just wonderful. Wonderful until you're ready to wean the kid and he's old enough to say 'NO WAY!' Ben was two and saying 'tittie, I want tittie!' His sperm donor was saying the same thing. I finally yelled 'they're MY titties and I don't want anyone to touch them EVER AGAIN!' Then everyone was depressed. Except me. No one touched me for two hours.   Pregnancy, oh pregnancy. Really depressing stuff. My first pregnancy, I was enormous. People would come up to me, this is true, and say 'are you expecting?' 'No' I'd say, patting my belly, 'this is a tumor.' Well, karma got me. My next pregnancy, my baby had a tumor. I was even more enormous than the first time, so now people came up to me and asked if I was having twins. 'No,' I'd say, I'm having a baby and a tumor.' Thank god I've had a hysterectomy. I'd probably have twin tumors the next time.   Pregnancy destroys your sex life. You know how many sexual positions you can get into when your belly alone weighs sixty-seven pounds? Two. And one involves your mouth. Not that anyone WANTS to get into those positions with you. Pregnancy is a lonely time.   The bodily sensations engendered by pregnancy could have been invented by the Marquis himself. I did know ahead of time that my ligaments would loosen up as a result of hormonal activity. I didn't know that a result of that would be that whenever I moved, the place where my pelvic bones join in the front would grate together with a sensation that resembles the sound made by a fingernail on a chalkboard.   Bodily functions of other sorts take on a new importance with pregnancy. While pregnant I discovered where every bathroom was within a 250 mile radius of my home. I also found out all the places you can pee without a bathroom. I discovered new uses for ziplock bags.  After use they can be used as water balloons to throw at those annoying  other  drivers on the road. No, I wouldn't really do that. I was a dignified pregnant lady, even if I did have to pee every six and a half minutes.   Babies can be loads of fun before they are born. If you scrunch your belly up real close to your significant other, baby will usually respond with some fairly potent kicks. You don't have to be the only one awake at 2:30 am. When the SO is thoroughly awake from the tattooing on his kidneys, you can innocently say, 'Isn't it wonderful to feel our baby move!'  To be continued.....",

        "blog_text": "Well since I haven't posted in centuries, I thought I would start over and have a new beginning.  For my first new post I would like to share a short story that I've written.  I hope you enjoy.   You can still post it on your page if you like.   Fatal Surprise     PART I    Deon's cheek hadn't even stopped stinging from the first slap before Chantal laid another one on him.  The pain shot through his body like a bolt of lightning and caused a single tear to drop from his eye, but he knew he deserved it.    'You lying bastard!!  How could you fuck that bitch?'  Chantal paced back and forth furiously.  'I hate you Deon Christopher Waller and I never want to see you again!  Get out!!'  Chantal's usage of his full name and the cold dagger tone of her voice sent a chill straight up his spin.  Deon turned to talk away but his brain yelled to him,  Fool you can't give up that easily!  You love this woman.   He spun around in pure determination. Ready for a fight, he stared into Chantal's beautiful light gray eyes and suddenly he found himself melted onto his knees.  He wrapped his arms around her petite waist and began to beg for her forgiveness.  As the tears fell down his cheeks, he poured his heart out to her.  'Chantal...baby...I love you and I...I... can't live without you.  It was a mistake!  I promise you!  I didn't realize what was going on till it was too late.  The boyz took me out drinking after work and...umm...I guess I had a little too much.  All I remember is this lady coming up to me and whispering something into my ear.  Next thing I know, I wake up in a strange bed...a strange room...a strange house!  Baby, believe me, I'm sorry...I'm truly sorry!  I let the alcohol and the dog take over my common senses.  You know I have never ever given you a reason to doubt me.  You know I love you with all my heart!  You're...you're...you're my soul mate, my one true love, and I can't live without you!'  The emotions took over him and he began to weep like a little child who just fell of their bike for the first time.  He was just as hurt and bruised but his bruise was in his heart.  He thought to himself,  how could I be such an ass? How did I end up here?  Maybe I shouldn't have told her.  This whole confession shit  really is overrated!!   He then realized that Chantal hadn't flattened him onto his ass and he slowly lifted his eyes to see what her facial expression was saying.  When his eyes finally reached Chantal's face he noticed her eyes were shut like she was trying to fight back the tears but they found routes to escape and were running down her glorious honey brown skin.  The sight of her crying broke his heart.  He never liked to see her cry and vowed he wouldn't be the one to cause her to cry.  He wanted to be the shoulder she cried on.  He really fucked up.  After what seemed like an eternity of silence, Chantal in an almost mute tone stated, 'I failed you didn't I?  I caused you to sleep with that woman!  If I would have given you more sex or been around more you wouldn't have done this...it's my fault isn't it.'  Hearing that made, Deon jump to his feet,   'Hell nah, baby...it's my fault!  I shouldn't have drunk so much.  I should have had enough sense about me to just bring my black ass home!  Please don't blame yourself...please...don't!' Chantal stared him in his blood shot eyes and softly said, 'I need you to leave me alone right now!  I need time to think!'    PART II    'Better yet...I'll leave.'  Chantal grabbed her purse and headed for the door.  She needed time; better yet she needed a drink.  'Baby...wait...don't leave like this!  Let's talk.  I'm...'  Deon was cut off by the slamming of the front door.  The next thing he heard was the sound of Chantal's Mercedes Benz flying out of the driveway, he just fell back into the coach and wished he could go back to last week.  Chantal reached Backstreet Bar & Grill, a quaint little bar located on the backstreets of downtown Atlanta.  She headed straight to the bar and ordered a Purple Passion.  Before the bartender could hand it to her; Chantal gulped it down and ordered another.  'Whoa...baby...you should slow down there.  I would hate to have to take your keys away.' The bartender threw her a smile and she notices how much he resembled Morris Chestnut.  As she sat there drowning her pain and sorrows, she sat there wondering what her next move should be.  Deon was her husband and she never suspected him of cheating on her before in all seven years they were together.  There three year wedding anniversary was in two days.  What a present, she thought to herself.  In the background, she could here Eamon's song,  and began to sing along...   See I don't, know why, I liked you so much I gave you all, of my trust I told you, I loved you, now that's all down the drain Ya put me through pain, I wanna let u know that I feel  What I said it don't mean shit now What the presents might as well throw em out What all those kisses, it didn't mean jack What you, you ho, I don’t want you...   Chantal broke down and started to cry.  Suddenly she felt a hand rub her back and heard a voice ask, 'Are you okay?'  When she looked up she was greeted by a beautiful mocha colored sistah with Asian features.  Even with her tear distorted vision, the woman standing before her was absolutely gorgeous.  She was smiling the brightest and most inviting smile.  Her lustrous jet black hair flowed down her back while a few strands escaped and rested along side her full-figured breast. Her legs seemed never ending only accentuated by the red silk mini dress and the matching red pumps.  She looked like she just stepped off the cover of either Essence or Jet magazine.  Any other time Chantal would have tried to find something wrong with such a woman, to make herself feel better, but tonight she was fighting other insecurities.  Again the lady repeated, 'Are you okay?'   'Oh...umm...I'm fine.' Chantal wiped her eyes and blew her nose.  'You don't look fine.  How about I buy you a drink and you tell me all about it.  I'm a great listener.'  'No, really I'm...I'm...fine.'  Chantal couldn't keep up the façade and broke out in tears again.  'Hey Roland, can you get us each  please.  This lady here looks like she needs a good one.'  The bartender winked and said, 'Always eager to please!'  Chantal was shocked by the lady's statement and fell out laughing.  'Ha...I knew that would help.  Hi...my name is Kyla...looks like you need a friend.'  Kyla sat down and within minutes the bartender came back with their drinks.  'Now tell me what the dog did!'  'Huh?'  'Girl, I know how it is.  You are sitting here in a bar all by yourself, drinking, and crying...has to be a man.  And any man that would make a woman cry...has to be a dog.'  Chantal just smiled and took a sip of her .  Finally she replied, 'The dog is my husband.'  'Hmmm...let me guess.  You found out he's been cheating on you.'  'Something like that, he confessed to me today that he had a one night stand with some woman he met.  He said it happened this past weekend.  I thought he was out with his boyz.'  'What?  Oh man, that's crazy.  I'm sorry girl.'  'You're not sorry...my husband is!'  'So what are you going to do?'  'I don't know he seemed genuinely sorry and he's never given me a reason not to trust him before.  But how could I trust that this won't happen again.  I've never had a feeling he was cheating on me before.  He said he was drunk and lost his senses.'  'That's no excuse.  I believe the things you do when you drink are the same things you would do if you were sober...the liquor just takes away the fear of acting it out.'  'Damn...our anniversary is in two days and I had a big surprise for him but I guess he surprised me first.'  Chantal and Kyla continued talking till closing time.    PART III    Like a sensual fragrance, the voice of Lenny Williams streamed all through the split level house.   ...I, I love you, baby With all my heart and soul Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  Love you I need you I want you I need you  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...   The stereo had been playing the same cry for hours.  Deon refused to let any other song occupy his thoughts.  The flames in the fireplace were no longer aflame; just an occasional crackle and simmering hum permeated the room.  He closed his eyes and reflected on one particular line in the song:  Some men need lots of women for their passions to feel but I want only you, girl.   Would Chantal ever believe that about him again?  A quick flash of light interrupted his darkness.  He glanced down at his wrist...no watch... hmmm .  He took a quick look over at the grandfather clock... 4:17a.m.    Finally Chantal was home and he could execute the request for forgiveness he had practiced over and over in his mind.  Chantal stared at the clock on the wood grain dashboard,  4:26a.m.   She had been sitting in the driveway for nearly ten minutes just gazing at the house.  For the first time she didn't want to go home.  She still wasn't prepared to confront Deon, her heart still wounded.  She closed her eyes to hold back the tears, only to be assaulted by images of Deon fucking another woman, his tongue exploring another pair of nipples, and his fingers satisfying another woman's cavity.  An icy chill ran up Chantal's spine.  She shook off those ghastly images and reached down for her cell phone.  *********************  Deon stood peeking out the living room bay window wondering why Chantal hadn't gotten out of the car yet.  Suddenly her headlights came back on and Deon jumped out of the way so she wouldn't see he was watching.  In a blink of an eye Chantal was gone.  What was going on?  He didn't understand.   Where could she possibly be going at 4:30 in the morning?   He dashed to the house phone and frantically dialed her number.   Damn...voicemail!     PART IV    As Chantal inverted through the five phases of sleep, she found herself stuck in stage one.  She was trapped in transition amid slumber and wakefulness.  A stimulating sensation coursed through her body causing an orgasmic sigh to leave her parceled lips.  The muscles of her thighs began to go into a highly enchanting spasm and her gem grew moist with each supple kiss.  On impulse, she stroked her already firm nipples.  Oh, how she adored the way Deon caressed her body.  Suddenly, a wet exotic entity invaded her, by now, throbbing womanly cavity.  She arched her back to allow deeper entry of this pleasing invasion.  Swiveling her hips, she thought how Deon's tongue could always speak to her lips in a dialect her body surely appreciated.  'Mmmm' she thought... Why did I come back?  I should have... Wait!   She jolted out of her semi conscious state.   Where the hell..Who?   'Oh shit!!  What...'  Chantal scrambled across the bed; her eyes rapidly scanning over the unfamiliar room in search for the closest exit route.   Think...think...how did you end up here.   She frantically gathered up the sheet to cover her bareness.  She searched for the voice that normally belonged to her but nothing was escaping her lips.  Instead she heard Deon's voice saying, '...Next thing I know, I wake up in a strange bed...a strange room...a strange house!'  Could this really be happening?   Was this how he felt all but two days ago?   She grabbed at her chest; gasping for air...she couldn't breathe. 'Chantal...baby...Are you okay?'   She searched her mind for this person's name.  She knew this person but how?  Where?   I know the name...It's...It's...It's ...'Kyla!'  'Yes...Tell me what you need.  Do you want me to bring you some water?'  Chantal shook her head, no.  'Kyla, what the hell is going on?' The edge of Kyla's lips curved up and a seductive glaze took over her eyes.  'I just thought I would start up part two.'  'Part two?'  Chantal was puzzled.  'Wait...let me think!'  As she concentrated on remembering, flashes of the yesterdays escapade came rushing through her mind.  She recalled meeting Kyla at Backstreet Bar & Grill and them exchanging numbers in the parking lot.  She flashbacked to sitting in her driveway watching Deon peer out the window...  Chantal, not knowing who she could call at 4:30 in the morning spotted Kyla's number lying on the passenger seat.  She hesitated at first but recalled that Kyla had offered her the guestroom if she needed it.  She took one last look at the living room window and dialed her cell.  *********************  Deon was awoken by the telephone ringing.  He jumped up and fumbled to punch the talk button on the cordless.  'Hello...Hello?'  'Hello, Mr. Waller?' An unfamiliar voice rang back through the receiver.  'Yes, this is he.'  He answered with the sound of disappointment in his tone.  'I'm calling from Northside Hospital.  I'm sorry to inform you but your wife was involved in a major automobile accident and...' before the nurse could complete her statement Deon had keys in hand and sprinted towards the front door.  He jumped in his Navigator, charged out of the driveway, and raced towards the hospital like Mario Andretti.  Weaving in and out of traffic at 95mph, Deon couldn't help but think the worse.  He clutched the steering wheel and began to pray.   Lord, please don't take my beautiful wife away from me.  I need her in my life.  I'm nothing without her.  She doesn't deserve this, Lord.  Please, we always kept you first in our marriage.  I'm coming to you with head bowed Lord and asking you to please spare my love.  I need her!  Please let her be okay. Please.  Please. Please...  Deon wiped away his tears.  He arrived in front of the hospital in record time: quickly located the parking lot, parked, and raced to the emergency room.  He reached the front desk gasping for air.  He frantically asked the petite Asian nurse located at the front desk, which room his wife was in.  'I'm sorry sir but...' Deon felt his heart plummeting. '...they still have her in the operating room.'  'Operating room...Is she all right?'  'Right now sir, I don't have all the details but if you would just take a seat in the waiting room; the doctor will update you as soon as he can.  Oh and sir, can you please complete this insurance information.'  The nurse handed Deon a clipboard and directed him to the waiting room.  As he sat there staring at the forms, the letters seemed to reposition on the page.  Suddenly, he was dyslexic; all the words seemed upside down and backwards.   When he was finally able to read the words and tried to fill out the forms his hands were shaking.  Finally, he gave up and laid the clipboard aside.   Damn...tell me this is all a bad dream.      PART V     It was now Sunday evening and Deon still hadn't heard from his wife.  His eyes were blood-shot and the veins were popping up in his forehead.   He hadn't gotten any sleep in over twenty four hours and it was draining him.  He was no longer the baby face twenty-nine year old.  He had aged ten years in less then a day.  As he continued to pace within the foyer, he clutched the cordless phone waiting for it to ring.  The few times the phone rang;  one call was from his law office and he sent it straight to voicemail , second call was from his boy...voicemail, the last call came up unknown so he quickly answered it...  'Hello?!'  'Hey dawg, I've been trying to reach you all day.  What happened to you the other night?  Last I saw you; you were out on the dance floor with that fly honey.'  Shit, it was his boy Easton.  Music was just blaring in the background.  'What the fuck you want man?'  'Damn...it's like that?  What the hell is wrong with you?'  'I'm just going through some shit right now...I have to call you back.'  Before his boy could protest, Deon hung up the phone.  He didn't mean to respond to his friend in such an unkind manner but he felt as though Easton was part of the reason why he was in this mess and just wasn't ready to deal with him right now.  Easton was the one that insisted they all go drinking to celebrate the victory of their most high profile case.  I should've just gone home like I planned.  Deon's idea of celebrating was going home and sexing his wife for countless of hours in every position his mind and body would allow him.  However, Mr. Just voted one of Atlanta's most eligible bachelors wanted to go to The Velvet Room and have his ego stroked by a bunch of money hungry club hoes.    If I wouldn't have gone to that club... damn Easton kept buying all those damn drinks for the group...shit!  Deon's fist went crashing straight into the wall. 'Aaarrggghhhh...damn!'  He stared at his white dusty hand which was beginning to bleed at the knuckles.  He became dizzy and made his way over to the living room sofa and before his head could hit the cushion, he was comatose.  **************  Chantal eyes gradually opened and were greeted by the moon light streaming through the bedroom window.   What time is it?  Her eyes scanned the room looking for a clock.  She caught sight of an alarm clock on the dresser across the room.  8:52pm...damn...I have to get out of here.  Chantal looked over at Kyla who was sound asleep and quietly slide out of the bed.  As she reached down to grab her belongings, Kyla stirred and Chantal halted.  Once Kyla was back at rest, she exhaled, successfully collected her belongings, and crept out the room.  Before exiting the room, she took one last look back.  What they shared was pleasurable and fulfilled her longtime hidden fantasy but she loved her husband and wanted to get back to him.  There was a lot that they needed to talk about. This was definitely a door she was going to have to close eternally.   Once I walk out this house there is no looking back.   She slowly closed the door to the bedroom and made her way downstairs into the living room to gather the rest of her possessions.   Damn...where is my other shoe?   She began searching around the living room but couldn't spot it anywhere.  She tried to retrace her steps but her memory was completely fogged.   Hmmm...maybe it got pushed under the sofa.  She reached her hand under the sofa, blindly searching for her other shoe.  Her hand landed on a mysterious item.  She pulled it out from under the sofa and her heart nearly leaped out her chest.  She fell back onto her heels and just held the object in her hand.   Oh my God!     PART VI     'No, this can't be!'  Tears began falling from Chantal's eyes onto the item in her hand.  She turned it over and read the expected engraving... I'll forever love you, Chanti .  She was staring down on the 14k gold wrist watch she purchased Deon for their first wedding anniversary.    'Chantal, are you leaving?'  Kyla's drowsy voice startled Chantal out of her devastation.  'It was you!'  'What?'  Kyla gazed, baffled by her statement.  'You slept with my husband!'  'I...what?'  Kyla was fully alert now.  She wasn't sure she heard that statement clearly.  Before she could pose the question again, Chantal rushed her and seized her by her hair.  Digging her nails into Kyla's scalp she shoved the watch into Kyla's face with the other hand.  'Bitch!  I gave this to him on our anniversary. You fucked my husband.'    'Ooouucchhh...Chantal, I'm sorry!  I didn't know...' Kyla's screeched out.  'You didn't know...what the fuck do you mean you didn't know!  That $3000 band on his hand should have told you he was a married man.'  'I didn't...I...I...'  'I...I...I...didn't what bitch.  You didn't care?!  It's obvious you didn't care!  Then you took advantage of my ass.'  'What?!  You came onto me...'  'The hell I did!  You knew what I was going through.  Getting me drunk and shit!  You're nothing but a triflin ass hoe.  How many other marriages have you ruined?'  Chantal was enraged.  Her face felt like it was on fire.  This was the woman that seduced her husband.  Chantal yanked Kyla up by her hair and hurled her up against the wall.  She wrapped her hands around Kyla's neck and began choking her.  Kyla pounded on her arms trying to free herself from Chantal's grip.  But the harder she struggled the stronger Chantal's grip became.  Chantal's gray eyes were now blackened and her stare was of death.  Images of Deon kissing and fondling Kyla raced through Chantal's mind.   ...All I remember is this lady coming up to me and whispering something into my ear.  Next thing I know, I wake up in a strange bed...a strange room...a strange house!  Baby, believe me, I'm sorry...I'm truly sorry!...   Deon's voice hummed through her head.  Suddenly Chantal froze and her hold loosened around Kyla's neck.  'What am I doing?'  She promptly let go and Kyla slide down the wall sobbing.    'I'm sorry Chantal...I'm sooo sorry.  It was a simple mistake...we were drunk and dancing...then one thing led to another....I'm so so sorry!' Kyla cried out.  Chantal just glared down at Kyla, who was now lying on the ground in a fetal position rocking back and forth.   How did I end up here?  God I need to get out of here.   Chantal grabbed her things and ran out the door not caring that she was still missing her shoe.  She jumped in her car, rested her head against the steering wheel and began to wail.  She cried for what seemed an hour.   Maybe this is all just a bad dream.  Any minute now I'm going to wake up wrapped in my husband's arms on a beautiful warm sunny Saturday morning.   Chantal squeezed her eyes tightly shut just waiting to wake up but to no avail she was still drowning in her misery.  With tears overflowing her eyelids she started up the car and headed towards I-85, full speed.  She wasn't sure what she was going to say or if they would be able to fix this critical mistake but she had to get home.  ***********************  Deon was awoken by the telephone ringing.  He jumped up and fumbled to punch the talk button on the cordless.  'Hello...Hello?'  'Hello, Mr. Waller?' An unfamiliar voice rang back through the receiver.  'Yes, this is he.'  He answered with the sound of disappointment in his tone.  'I'm calling from Northside Hospital.

Please, we always kept you first in our marriage.  I'm coming to you with head bowed Lord and asking you to please spare my love.  I need her!  Please let her be okay. Please.  Please. Please...  Deon wiped away his tears.  He arrived in front of the hospital in record time: quickly located the parking lot, parked, and raced to the emergency room.  He reached the front desk gasping for air.  He frantically asked the petite Asian nurse located at the front desk, which room his wife was in.  'I'm sorry sir but...' Deon felt his heart plummeting. '...they still have her in the operating room.'  'Operating room...Is she all right?'  'Right now sir, I don't have all the details but if you would just take a seat in the waiting room; the doctor will update you as soon as he can.

When he was finally able to read the words and tried to fill out the forms his hands were shaking.  Finally, he gave up and laid the clipboard aside.   Damn...tell me this is all a bad dream.      PART VII     Deon sat in the waiting room with his head propped up against the wall and his eyes tightly closed.  He was battling an overwhelming sense of guilt.  He thought,  If only I could turn back the hands of time.   However, he knew that wasn't possible and he was going to have to deal with the here and now of the situation.    'Mr. Waller?'   Deon's eyes flashed open and met with the weary gaze of a middle aged Caucasian man.  His salt and pepper hair gave him a distinguished look.  But his eyes were what made Deon's heart race; they disclosed mourning.  'Mr. Waller, my name is Dr. Schaffer...'  'Dr. How is my wife?'  'Your wife was brought in with massive trauma to the head and a shattered rib.  We've managed to control the internal bleeding and have her stabilized for now however she is in a comma.  There is no telling how long she will be in an unconscious state or exactly the extent of her injuries at this present time.  We are currently waiting on the results from her cat scan...'  As Deon stood there the room went from an orchestra of clamor to a place of a chilling silence.  The doctor's lips were moving but he didn't hear the any words emerging.   No more did he hear the pregnant woman across the way doing her breathing exercises or the squeaking of the nurse's hospital shoes as they walked by.   The doctor placed a hand on his shoulder and guided him back down to his seat.  Deon positioned his face into his hands and tried to shake off the sudden deafness.        '...Waller?  Mr. Waller.  Mr. Waller!'   Deon's hearing came back full force.  'Mr. Waller!'  'Huh?  I mean yes.'  'Do you think you are strong enough to visit with your wife?  I want you to talk to her, give her the drive she needs to live.'  'But doc will she be able to hear me?'  'Observations have shown that even in a state of a comma, some individuals still respond to outside stimulus such as the sound of a love ones voice.  At this point son, it doesn't hurt to try.'  Deon followed the doctor through the double doors and down a lengthy colorless corridor.  When they arrived in front of the Intensive Care Unit, Deon paused and said a quick prayer for strength and walked in to the room.  There laid his picturesque wife.  Even with, her hair disheveled, lips chapped, and plugged up to all kinds of machines she still looked like an angel but she also had a look of grief.  'I'll leave you two alone.'  The doctor turned and left the room.    Deon walked over to Chantal's bedside where she laid sleeping.  He delicately brushed the hair away from her face then bent down and kissed her gently on the lips.  'Chantal, what have I done to you?  I never meant for things to turn out this way.  It was all just a stupid mistake.  I'm soooo sorry.'  Deon began weeping but he was interrupted by a phone ringing.  He checked his cell phone but it wasn't his he looked around the room and spotted Chantal's belongings.  He went over and found her cell phone.  'Chantal, please don't hang up and don't say anything just listen please.  I didn't know he was your husband and I'm really sorry but I'm not sorry about what we shared.  These pass two days have been magic for me and I never felt like this about anyone.  I know you're probably upset and confused right now but...'  The phone came crashing down to the ground and Deon just looked at his wife still laying there in her slumber.   The End…maybe",

In that instant, it felt like my entire world had cracked open and nothing made sense. I needed someone to blame, someone to feel my pain, and all the agony churned into anger I couldn't control.

Then an unexpected chain of events lead to an unexpected conclusion. As a child in the second grade, life is typically care-free. Eight year old boys usually worry about the new G.I. Joe or Transformer action figure and play set. Getting on and off the school bus was my biggest responsibility. The school I attended would pick up the elementary students at the end of the day and bus them to the high school to wait for those students to board. This lead to about a ten minute wait for the elementary students, who were allowed to get off the bus and play in the courtyard until the high school dismissed. So with that ten minutes of freedom, my friend and I departed the bus and began to do what little boys do best, run and play. However, the daily routine would soon be broken. The routine went something like this. The high school students would dismiss and board the buses, followed by the roar of the buses diesel engines cranking up. This was our signal to find our way back to the appropriate bus and get on for the ride home. On this day, however, my friend and I took our time making the short trip back to our big, yellow mode of transportation. We bounced along kicking rocks, jumping from anything we could climb on, and playing in the dirt. For an eight year old boy, the shortest distance between two points is a skewed line. Our pace quickened, however, when we noticed the lead buses pulling away. Running up to our bus we found nothing but a folding, glass and metal door that was shut tight. I can remember the expression on the drivers face. Without a word she said it all, she was making a point, and no matter how much we beat on the door, she wasn’t going to open it. She just shook her head and said, “No”.  My friend and I watched that bus, and many more pull out of the lot. I had never seen that lot empty, until now. It was an unfamiliar territory. We started to make our journey on foot, walking up a busy street that lead to the overpass and our neighborhood on the other side of the interstate. I remember being so scared of being run over or picked up by some evil person. The worst thought though, was what my mother was going to say or do. The awful and swift punishment I would receive couldn’t match being run over by a truck. Just before we made it to the overpass, my friends’ mother pulled up beside us. This was all made possible by my brother, who had made it onto the bus in the first place, and was already home. On the ride home, I tried to be as invisible as possible. My friends’ mother let us know how she felt about our adventure. She was not pleased. I knew that I would get the same treatment when I arrived home, and I was petrified. In my minds eye, I could see my mothers’ belt, affectionately known as “White Lightning”, just lying there, waiting to dispense punishment. My friends’ mother dropped me off at my house and I prepared for the worse. However, my wild imagination was wrong. There were no belts cracking, no beatings, no yelling or reprimanding. Only the smell of home-made pizza and the loving embrace of my concerned mother. She wasn’t mad, and she had made pizza for supper! That was too much, I didn’t believe it. That day in my childhood is, without a doubt, the worst and greatest. It was an emotional roller coaster that stands out among my thousands of experiences and will remain with me forever.",

        "blog_text": "The grunge generation grows up \nThey were known for their lack of commitment. Now Generation X is making waves, its own way. By Kim Campbell | Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor \nNEW YORK - If the term 'Generation X' brings to mind 'slackers' who listen to grunge rock, you might want to take a closer look at the parents dropping off their kids at day care these days. \nWhile no one was looking, Gen X grew up, and signs of their maturing are everywhere - from the release last month of the 10th-anniversary edition of the movie 'Reality Bites,' to a trend in stay-at-home moms. \nDepending on whose measure you use, the first of the Xers will turn 40 next year - more than a decade after trend-spotters found similarities between the socially disengaged characters in the 1991 novel 'Generation X' and the 20- somethings of the day. \nMany of those in Gen X (born roughly between 1965 and 1979) now own their own companies, are raising children, and scoff at the stereotypes that were created about them in the early 1990s - particularly that they are cynical slackers who avoid commitment to jobs and relationships. \n'That doesn't sound like me or most of my friends,' says Tim Nekritz, a public relations professional and graduate student in his mid-30s from Oswego, N.Y. 'We're like our parents' generation, in my opinion. We're getting married, having kids, settling down, buying houses.... I think we're like a lot of other generations that approach middle age.' \nGeneration X may not have the numbers or the name recognition of the baby boomers, but its members - now approximately 25 to 39 years old, and 60 million strong - are putting their stamp on everything from parenting to planning for the future. Approaching their years of highest earning, this group is poised to influence not only housing prices and car styles, but social policy as well. \nThey live the life they want \nMore independent-minded than baby boomers, Gen Xers have been forging their own approach to adult life in recent years. Unlike their own parents, who had high divorce rates and dual incomes, Xer moms and dads are spending more time with their children, even leaving the workforce to raise them. Those who are single are also trying to balance work and a personal life. \n'The legacy that the boomers gave Gen X was permission to do what you wanted, essentially,' says Ann Clurman, a senior partner at Yankelovich, a marketing consulting firm that tracks generational trends. 'And Gen X has really taken up that banner: If you want to have kids, have kids. If you want to work, work. If you want to stay home, stay home.' \nWhereas boomers tend to feel they have a moral duty to tell the world when they find the right way to do something, members of Gen X are more private, says Ms. Clurman. Xers are less ideological than boomers, and 'that's one of the reasons that people sort of ... ignored them for a while, because they were hard to understand.' \nBut the picture is becoming clearer of what this generation looks like as CEOs and diaper-changers. Defying the apathetic label, Xers have shown an entrepreneurial spirit and are more attuned to the need to invest for retirement, having been told there may be little Social Security left when the 76 million boomers are done with it. Gen X is said to be the first generation that may end up worse off than their parents, but they are also the first to enter the workforce as major innovations in communication technology - e-mail, cellphones, high-speed Internet access - were taking over. \nThe result? They live the way they want to. \n'I believe my generation is constantly seeking ways to blend work and life together,' says Heather Malec, who's in her early 30s, by e-mail from Chicago. \nMs. Malec says she doesn't mind working from home before and after typical office hours if it means she can make it to an afternoon tennis class, for example. 'It gives me the flexibility to work from wherever I need to in order to get the job done and still have a life.' \nGen X parenting habits are of particular interest to those tracking generational trends. \nToday, 51 percent of children under 18 have parents who qualify as Gen X, according to an analysis by Reach Advisors, a Boston marketing-strategy and research firm. (Reach Advisors also analyzed Census Bureau data to come up with the 60 million figure for the population of Gen X, which can vary depending on which beginning and ending dates are selected.) \nGen X moms and dads tend to be homebodies - they are willing to sacrifice one spouse's income to have a parent at home with the kids, and frequently have to go into debt to own a house. Sometimes they choose arrangements, such as each spouse working a part-time job, that ensure that both parents get time with the children. \n'They're willing to do what it takes to have family stability, because they didn't get it when they were young,' says Ann Fishman, president of Generational Targeted Marketing Corp. 'So this is something new, the importance placed on raising your children.' \nIn 2002, Yankelovich reported that 67 percent of Xer moms said they planned to do a better job of raising their children than the generation before them. And for the first time in decades, fewer women are returning to the workforce in the first year after giving birth, according to Census data. When Reach Advisors conducted a survey of 3,020 parents at the end of 2003 ('Generation X: From Grunge to Grown Up'), they found that the increase in stay-at-home moms can be attributed in part to decisions made by college-educated Gen X women in households with incomes of more than $120,000 a year. \nDads spend more time with the family \nGen X dads are also trying to be more involved. Marty Kotis, president and CEO of Kotis Properties in Greensboro, N.C., says in e-mails and a phone interview that he worked from home for six to eight weeks after his son was born last year, and continues to actively participate in his son's upbringing. \n'I think the approach with baby boomers was a lot more hands-off,' says the 35-year-old, explaining he knows fathers of that generation who never changed a diaper. 'My wife doesn't work right now, but I still feel like we should share the joys and responsibilities of raising our son.' \nThe implications for labor markets - and even housing prices - of fewer working spouses are significant, notes James Chung, an Xer and president of Reach Advisors. An outcome of only one parent working is that couples are not as set on living a convenient distance from the workplace of both parents. 'What you're seeing is [that] house prices are rising faster in communities that cater to those [single-income] families,' he says. \nMr. Kotis is an example of another Xer trait: He plans for the future, particularly for retirement. Not long after he was elevated to the head of his family's company, he established a 401(k) program for the firm's employees, a majority of whom are Xers, too. 'I sort of think of [Social Security] as a joke,' he says. 'I don't think it's going to be around when I'm old enough to need it.' \nStudies suggest his attitude is shared by others of his generation. Yankelovich has found that Xers have their eyes on retirement at an earlier age than boomers did, says Clurman. And the recent Reach Advisors survey found that 29 percent of Gen Xers versus 22 percent of boomers were saving for retirement with 401(k) or other defined contribution plans. \n'This is a generation that does not necessarily expect to have the same kind of financial security as their parents do,' says Mr. Chung. 'And that's a big change.'",

        "blog_text": "“ I hate the Wyoming Valley .”  I’ve said it so many times in the past, but if you asked me why, I don’t think I could give you a good, solid reason.  I think I just say it because I always have.  Yes, that sounds stupid, but we all say and do things for reasons unknown.  I just returned from a brief visit to my hometown.  I like to go home when I have nothing to do so I have time to just drive around.  I love to visit all my old haunts- the places where I grew up, that are full of so many fond memories.   This time, I decided to drive down to my old elementary school- Ss. Peter and Paul.  I parked my car and just walked around, reliving some of my childhood memories.  I sat on the ground near my favorite telephone pole in the asphalt playground.  I walked down to the red box and then to the white box that is now painted red.  I swung around the metal rails and walked to the big kid end of the playground.  These things don’t mean a damned thing to anyone of you, but for some inexplicable reason, they give me an amazing level of comfort.  I visit there often, just to sit and reminisce about the days when everything seemed so much easier.  Days when my parents had all the answers, when my teachers could solve any problem, and I had dreams of marrying a woman and having three great kids and a dog.  The school and its surroundings that give me such a tremendous level of comfort is the same school where now, many years later, I can remember my first homosexual attractions.  It was the beginning of my 7th grade year.  A few of the 8th grade boys came into my classroom to get some books.  They were taller than last year.  Their voices had changed over the summer and for some inexplicable reason, I loved to hear them speak.  I just couldn’t stop looking at them.  I think they were on to me, actually I know they were on to me.  But I was unbelievable clueless.  I didn’t have the benefit of any gay role models in 1992.  ‘Will and Grace’ wasn’t even thought of yet.  I don’t think I even knew what the word “gay” meant.  In 8th grade I remember being very attracted to another boy in my class.  I can use the word attraction now, because I know what it feels like.  Back then, I had no word to use, no point of reference.  I would find myself watching him work during class time.  I couldn’t explain why I was drawn to him.  I just knew it was wrong.  Sneaking peaks at him while we were changing for gym was even worse.  I would grow out of this, I thought.  Hormones will kick in and I’ll actually like girls.  Just give it time.   I don’t hate the Wyoming Valley as much as I hate the 90’s.  The Wyoming Valley wasn’t any worse with gay/lesbian issues than the rest of the world back then.  How many kids felt the same way I did in 1993?  More importantly, how many kids feel the same way in 2004?  Being gay isn’t wrong.  It isn’t a lack of hormones or a result of mom and dad not showing affection to each other.  It isn’t a synapse misfiring in the brain or a choice to live an alternative lifestyle outside the mainstream.  It is just the way we are, and that my friends, is inexplicable.",

        "blog_text": "Amanda knew that she was in trouble. She wasn't entirely sure what her husband would say when he got home, but there really was no way that she would be able to finish her chores in time now, and he'd been insistent that they should be completed. 'I suppose it will serve me right if he spanks me', she thought, 'after all, I should have started doing these hours ago. Still, I suppose that if I at least start doing them and get as much done as I can, he might not mind them not being finished.' Just as she finished hoovering, she heard the foreboding sound of the car pulling onto the driveway shortly followed by the rattle of his keys in the lock. 'I'm for it now...' she thought as she finished putting the hoover back in the cupboard under the stairs. She hurried over to the door from the entrance hallway, hoping that greeting him with a kiss and a cheerful 'Hello Darling' might (combined with his long day at work) persuade him to overlook the fact that she had not yet finished the list of things to do. The kiss and the greeting brought a smile to his face, and it was a second or so before he glanced around. The living room had been hoovered and tidied, as per Amanda's list. He smiled again. 'I'll just fix us some drinks - it looks like you've had a busy day as I have' he said cheerfully. Hoping her eyes didn't betray her, she smiled 'No, no - let me get them. You sit down and relax. After all, I've not had to commute anywhere' and went into the kitchen before he could say anything. She knew he wouldn't think to look under the sofa or in the sideboard - which was where she'd hurriedly shoved the magazines that were scattered over the lounge. But she couldn't easily hide the basket full of damp washing, taken out of the machine that morning and still not hung up. Nor could she do the pile of washing up still waiting to be done in the time it took for the kettle to boil. Besides, he would hear her. As the kettle boiled she gave a gasp. Her computer was still turned on, and a quick glance would certainly give him a good idea of what she had spent her day doing. The trouble was, reading 'blogs was so addictive. Her mind raced as she made the tea, almost forgetting to put his one-and-a-bit-well-really-only-one sugar in his cup. Finally, as she brought the tea through into the lounge, she hit on a plan. 'Here's your tea sweetheart' murmured Amanda softly as she put it down on the coffee table in the middle of the living room within reach of the sofa. Now, all she needed to do was keep him out of the kitchen and bedroom long enough for her to be able to make the bed, hide the laundry (the outdoor clothes drier was still in the shed as they hadn't got round to putting it up yet, so no chance of hanging it up out back) and finish off the washing up. At least the bed wouldn't take long to sort out. All it would need would be the sheets straightening and the duvet an pillows arranging. But how to keep him out of the bedroom when he would want to go and get changed out of his suit and into something more comfortable once he'd finished that cup of tea? Perhaps if she waited in the hope that he would need the bathroom, then run into the bedroom there would be the chance that she might be able to make the bed before he went in to get changed. But how to keep him occupied while she finished off downstairs? She sat down next to her husband on the sofa and kissed him tenderly on the cheek, 'Let me take your case and jacket upstairs and hang them up for you my darling while you put your feet up. I'll get you a couple of biscuits - you look like you've had a hard day' 'Thank you darling, that's very thoughtful of you.' 'phew, that's a relief - thought he was going to go straight upstairs to get changed' thought Amanda as she popped into the kitchen to get a couple of chocolate biscuits, 'I'm doing us spaghetti with tomato, garlic and chilli sauce for dinner tonight' she called through from the kitchen. 'Ooh, my favourite. Could you just pop the biscuits down next to my mug? I need the loo - back in a moment.' came the reply. As she heard him start to go upstairs Amanda hurried quietly out of the kitchen, put the biscuits on a plate by the mug and dashed upstairs into the bedroom. Hurriedly, she finished straightening up the bed - pulling sheets and duvet up and straightening the pillows. 'Eeek.. Running water, he must be washing his hands!' she thought. However, she was just in time, opening the wardrobe door to hang up his suit jacket just as he walked in to get changed after finishing in the bathroom. 'Thank you darling. I'll just get changed and go back downstairs and finish that cup of tea.' He sat on the bed and started undoing his shoelaces. Amanda almost breathed a sigh of relief ('one down, two to go!' she thought) and said cheerfully, hoping that her voice wouldn't give anything away, 'Tell you what my darling. Why don't you put your feet up on the bed and have a read while I cook dinner? I'll bring you up your tea and biscuits.' She leaned forwards and kissed him gently on the lips. 'Mmm, I might just do that' he said, stifling a yawn. Amanda headed downstairs, feeling almost triumphant - she'd got away with it so far, but as she got halfway down the stairs, he wandered out onto the landing and called after her in a puzzled tone of voice 'Darling, why wasn't there any laundry hanging up in the bathroom?' Amanda paused briefly and trying not to look startled turned slightly to look up at him, quickly framing her answer very carefully in her mind before replying... 'It's the underwear, silly - I almost always tumble dry it. It just makes it feel so much nicer...' she managed a smile and a gentle laugh as she headed off to cook dinner, hoping he wouldn't check to see if it had been put away. Downstairs, she quickly rearranged the washing so there was a new, black T-shirt obscuring the door. Unless you actually peered at it, it looked empty. Happy with the effect, she started clattering around preparing dinner, then turned the CD player on, skipping to a particularly noisy track, and a favourite of hers. Having established the background noise, she speedily washed up whilst the sauce cooked. Just before she put the pasta on, she raced upstairs with the empty laundry basket, then stuck her head round the bedroom door. 'Just doing the pasta' she said cheerily. He grinned 'I'm famished... mmm' he looked her over appraisingly, hungrily for a moment, causing her to blush. 'I s'pose dinner would spoil if I tore you away from it right now?' 'Y... yes' she stammered, and raced downstairs, rapidly drying up what she could whilst the rest of dinner cooked. She glanced at the timer - two minutes to go. She might just make it. So preoccupied with doing dinner and trying to finish the drying up, she didn't hear him come into the kitchen. She was suddenly aware of his breath on her neck, and his arms around her waist. He kissed her lightly on the cheek, then moved to get the cutlery out. She must be overly paranoid, she thought, but she was sure he paused a moment to glance in the sink, and to look over the draining board, where some wet dishes still remained. But he said nothing, just took the cutlery through. After dinner, he cuddled her and, grinning, said 'You know darling, pampering me when I got home, cooking me my favourite dinner, a more suspicious man than I would think you were hiding something.' His tone made it clear he was joking, so she again managed a laugh 'Well, I had to remove the evidence that I see a fancy man whilst you're out'. But out of the corner of her eye she noticed that one of the sideboard doors wasn't properly shut. He caught the look of panic in her eyes, and followed her gaze, starting to frown as he couldn't see anything that would alarm his wife. He was about to say so, when one of the cats jumped up onto it, misjudged slightly, and scrabbled up, sending the door flying open. Almost in slow motion, the magazines fell out onto the floor. Amanda gasped, her hands flying to her mouth as she watched in horror. With a smile, he took her wrist, and gently but silently led her back into the kitchen, opening the washing machine door. The wet washing fell out onto the floor in a heap. He felt it, and teasingly said 'I think the tumble dryer must be broken. This is still all very damp. And just how long ago did you do the washing up?' She gulped, and hung her head. 'I err, got a bit carried away. Doing things.' He said nothing, just watching her, waiting for her to explain further. When nothing was forthcoming, he pulled himself up to his full height, and looked down at her sternly, tipping her head up so he could see her face. 'Things?' he queried, in 'that' tone. ''blogs' she almost whispered 'I was reading blogs...' She tried to lower her head, but he held it there, looking into her eyes. His expression was stern, disappointment mingled with mild annoyance. Quietly, so she had to strain to hear it 'You let reading blogs take precedence over the tasks I set? I'm disappointed in you, my darling. I had expected better of you than that'. He paused, watching her, hiding his smile as her cheeks reddened - she always did look so appealing when she blushed, whatever the cause. 'Now - upstairs with you this instant. You know what we agreed.' She went upstairs, dragging her feet a little. After all, it wasn't as if she had completely ignored it. He followed her up, sat down on the dressing table chair, and grabbed her wrist, pulling her to him. Before she had a chance to complain, he had pulled her skirt up, her panties down, and then pulled her over his knee, holding her down with his free hand. She wriggled desperately to try and get free, but he held her firmly, enjoying the spectacle of her naked bottom wiggling away. Just as she seemed be getting fairly frenzied in her attempts, he brought the palm of his hand down onto her bare buttocks. She froze mid wriggle and squealed at the sting. He repeated it, and smiled at the red glow that was appearing. Again, she tried to wriggle free, and again he spanked her twice, hard, smiling at the squeals and the growing rosy glow. 'Two more' he said, and again brought his palm down hard on her rear. She squealed again, indignantly more than with pain, and finally wriggled free after the last one. She rubbed her sore behind, then hurriedly rearranged her clothes, gaining some semblance of dignity. She moved away a couple of paces and stuck her hands on her hips. 'I hardly think that was fair!' she protested 'after all, I did get most of it done, even if not quite how you'd envisaged!' He watched her as she ranted, quietly amused, aware that his expression was probably just adding fuel to the fire, which simply made him smile a little more. As she started the third variant of 'it's not fair, I did most of it' he stood up, his amused expression dropping from him like a cloak. 'That' he said quietly, authoritatively, 'is hardly the point' he smiled a little 'and I don't think fairness, or at least the usual perception of such, comes into this at all. Do you?' She gasped, and stuttered a no. He walked around to the 'toy cupboard', and got out the cane. 'Now - for your insolence, I think 6 will be enough. On the bed, now' His tone did not even allow for disobedience, and she found herself face down on the bed, bum in the air, skirt hitched up over hips and her panties down around knees before she even realised she'd done it. It wasn't, he decided, a bad enough offence to warrant 6 full strength blows with the cane. He smiled, watching her lying there, tense with anticipation of the pain to come. But, he thought, there was no need to tell her that. He settled instead for telling her she must not move until it was over - and if she did, she would earn herself another stroke per move. He smiled once more, and swished the cane down. She yelped as the cane bit - she could feel a fiery stripe appearing on her buttocks where it landed. She wanted to roll out the way, to rub it, but she gritted her teeth, and stayed put. She knew it wasn't full strength, and she found herself tensing, expecting the next one to land harder. Then, remembering the pain would be worse if she stayed tense, she tried to force herself to relax. Standing over her, he smiled again as he saw her internal struggle, then brought the cane down with a swish, pulling it back a little just before it landed so that if anything, it was slightly lighter than before. The smile widened as he realised it had landed parallel to the first, even with the movement of the cane just before impact. Then again, once, twice, three times more. He paused again, admiring the parallel lines before he brought the cane down for one last stroke as he murmured 'last one'. As the final cane stroke landed on her buttocks, he softly told her that she could now lay down. Amanda crumpled forwards onto the bed, and as he hung the cane back onto its hook she began to sniffle. And then to sob. He sat down on the bed beside her, and ran his fingers gently through her hair as the sobbing turned to tears and Amanda began to cry. 'I... I'm sorry my darling' she managed to get out in between sobs as a tear ran down her cheek. He wiped away the tear and kissed her cheek softly. 'You know my love. That spanking wasn't because you hadn't finished your chores. It was because you decided to try and hide the fact.' he paused and kissed her gently again, rolling her onto her side so he could cradle her head in his lap. Softly, he continued, 'It was because you decided that rather than coming to me and apologising that you'd been distracted, you decided to try to deceive me.' Amanda sobbed again, feeling his arms gently round her, holding her, caring for her. 'I'm sorry I tried to deceive you' she sniffed 'I know that I should have said, but...' 'But you thought that I wouldn't notice? Sweetheart, If you'd just apologised, what do you think would have happened?' 'I thought you'd spank me', another sniffle, her tears drying. He wiped her cheek gently, lovingly 'I might have done, but only if you hadn't finished them by the time we would have been going to bed. Yes, I'd have been annoyed, but if you'd been honest with me, I'd have just given you a little more time, and you probably wouldn't have been spanked and caned. Would you?' 'Oh sweetheart. I love you. I'm sorry' 'Hush baby,' he put a finger gently to her lips, 'you don't need to keep apologising. It's all over and dealt with now.' a brief pause, then 'I love you too. Very much' They kissed gently, and then he smiled warmly; 'So you spent the day reading blogs eh? Any good postings I should know about?' 'Well... there was a post on...' she said, and he cut her off with a kiss. Then laughing together, they went to their respective computers and started reading the blogs...",

        "blog_text": "Well, well, well. It seems that I, Julie, have been, for the first time, dumped. I'm really kind of shocked here. I mean, I saw it coming, but then again I didn't. So here's what happened: School let out on Thursday of this week. I didn't see or hear from Lucas at all that day, or Friday, or Saturday, until I finally decided to break down and call him. I had talked to his best friend, Jared, about the possibility of Lucas breaking up with me and Jared said (this is a direct quote) 'I can tell you with 100% accuracy as his best friend that he wouldnt do that'. Well thank you, you dirty liar. When I called Lucas I used the premise that I wanted him to help pass out programs at the graduation with NHS. (I'm an officer, by the way, so it would make sense that I would try to recruit people for this.) He said he would help me and when we hung up, for the first time ever, he didn't say that he loved me. Now I was a little confused. After he came to pick me up, 15 minutes late might I add, we started on our way there and again, for the first time ever, he didn't hold my hand as we were driving along. Obviously, something was up, so I asked him if it would be alright if we just didn't go and he felt that would be fine. As we started back I began to cry because I knew the inevitable was about to occur: he was going to dump me. He noticed the tears and asked me what was wrong. After no reply he pulled into the parking lot where we had our second date; the place where he had first kissed me. Again, he asked me what was wrong and this time I told him.  'I'm afraid.'  'Of what?' 'I'm afraid about you.'  'Why's that?'  'I think you know.' Oh, he knew alright. We talked and according to him he was dumping me because of my friend Talley, because I'm a pushover, and because I automatically assume the worst about situations. Of course, I cried... and cried... and cried some more. Then he threw out the can-we-still-be-friends line and I started to bawl. When I finally got him to take me home I was able to hold back my tears and joke about the situation sayin things like 'At least now I have a reason to eat too much ice cream' to make him feel less awkward. After we got home I got out of the car before he could open the door for me, the little bastard, and sat on the driveway where he gave me a hug and two kisses: one on my head and one on my forehead. Then he held me between sobs. The last thing he said to me was 'Goodbye, lovely' wich really pissed me off. How could he say that? It's going to be so hard to see him now. Everytime I looked up and my eyes could see clearly enough to make out his face, I broke down again. I love him so much. I told him I would miss him, and he said he would miss me, that dumbass. I don't understand him. Of course, I've decided to go out with someone else as soon as I can to make the little jerk jealous, and believe me, he'll get jealous. Now to pick a target...",

So I've been pretty happy the last couple weeks, but I always have this impending 'Yeah, that's not going to last'...or as Sluggy Freelance puts it: ' 'Oh.' said God.  'A challenge.' '  So I had a minor meltdown last night.  Those are usually triggered by something minor going wrong...in this case it was me hormonally blaming Candyman for something that I don't even remember now, and me being pissed off, then dissolving into tears for an hour or so.  It's also often brought on by lack of sleep.  (sh)It happens way too often for my liking.  I'm better now.  There's very few things going on in my life.  I have a 99.9% of the time great relationship, I love my job, I don't have major bills to pay, I'm healthy, I live in a great area of the world and I'm adorable.  However, there's something rotten and nasty inside me saying that I don't deserve what I have, that I'm spoiled and that it's all going to come crashing down on me when the Cosmos realizes that they screwed up and my life is supposed to be given to that chick down the street.  Like in Cambodia.  Am I supposed to be grateful for what I have?  Sometimes I feel like it's not enough, and other times I feel like it's too much and I don't deserve it.  It's really strange.  However, I went to karate tonight.  My mind feels clearer.  I feel better.  Karate is something that I can see myself improving in everytime I attempt it.  It's something which allows me to push myself in ways that I never have before, and that's something I need.  It's giving me clarity, purpose and a sense of being grounded in something that is larger than I am. Being karate-ka (karate student) is forcing me to take my time, to work towards something, but know that working harder isn't necessarily going to get me there.  'Life's a journey, not a destination.' and I need to remember to focus myself on that.  Last night while I was very angry and upset, I said something which really struck me.  'I'm going to be so pissed off when I move out and discover I'm still so miserable.'  I didn't realize it at the time, but I think that's part of my problem.  I'm one of those people who, if they aren't smacked down, will go through life like this...   'I'll be happy when... ...I finish high school.' ...I get a job.' ...I move out.' ...I find a significant other.' ...I get married.' ...I have kids.' ...the kids move out.' ...I retire.'  Whoops, I'm dead.  And that happens to TOO DAMNED MANY PEOPLE!  I refuse to let myself do that.  This is part of the reason why I started this blog in the first place.  I have let the stars (moving out, getting a job etc.) blind me to the fact that I am currently living my life.  The only one I get, depending on who you believe, but dammit, right now it's the only one I have, so why should I waste my time screwing around with it?  Um, anyway...comments are welcome.",

In her very first post she mentions the role that love has played for her in her life and how it has evolved: Life isn't love and love isn't life. Amazingly insightful. I think the mountain air has done her some good. There is love in so many things other than our partners. I lost sight of that a little with Marta... I truly did live just for her, just to be near her. I kept going to school, of course... but all other plans were laid with her in my mind. I thought she was my 'forever'. And I was content for a long time. I think as time passed, as she grew further away from her, taking her own life in her hands.. often without me... I realized I was lacking something as a human... a singular motivation and self-love. I had no reason to live other than for her... and as she withdrew, when I saw her interact with friends, when I saw the life I wasn't a part of, I grew resentful. There are so many things I want but I can't seem able to get, no matter how hard I try. It's easier to ignore my shortcomings and fill them with someone else's presence than to face them down, and fill the voids on my own. My therapist asked me once to describe myself... my interests... and what I valued about myself... and there was a long, doubting silence. I could think of less than a handful of things that were positive aspects... I think this also explains why I become so jealous when my g/f discusses her ex's... or talks to them on the phone... or receives email from them. I'm not insecure about losing her - I'm just jealous of this whole life that she has led... the things she's done, the places she's been. Every day I wonder if I'm living at all... or just going through the motions... it's very disconcerting to not know. But then I focus on the things that bring me small joys: sunsets, pets curled up asleep on my lap, that first sip of coffee in the morning, autumn leaves in the wind... there are many small loves in this world, and they are enough to sustain us without the big 'L' capital/italics. There is the love we feel for others, too. I thought that I had repaired my emptiness in the last year... since Marta has been gone... but it lingered far longer than expected. I wasn't able to fill the voids. I feel now, however, more aware of my emotions, my responses, my self-worth and values... I think I can fill myself up, as a whole person, without latching onto someone again. None of us 'need' someone else to be whole... we just think we do.",

Now, instead of clinging to another person to feel whole, I find small moments of beauty and joy—these remind me that I can sustain myself.

Also trying to think of painless ways to do painful things with a minimum of cleanup after.  This is probably why more Virgos don't actually kill themselves.  I have a huge collection of things that I love that will mean almost nothing to anyone else, and yet I care where they end up.  Who even remembers 'My One & Only,' much less cares that I saw it about six times and own the propeller that Tommy Tune carried around in it?  Or Sarah Brightman's double mask from 'Phantom?'  Sheryl Lee Ralph's shoes from 'Dreamgirls' might be an easier sell, but probably not B.D. Wong's shoes from 'M. Butterfly'.  What about the model for the set of Cinderella's house from 'Into The Woods,' the mining pick from 'Crazy For You' signed by the entire original cast, my letter from Sondheim, my letter from Katharine Hepburn?  My collected works of the Algonquin Round Table...most of them first editions, many signed.  That Woollcott biography of Mrs. Fiske is damn rare, and how'm I gonna explain that the Jack Baragwanath (who was Neysa's husband) memoir is personally autographed to Robert Sherwood's wife...ugh.

I don't own a gun, nor do I know anyone who does.  Oh wait, I do, but I'm not talking to him.  Partly 'cause he owns a gun.  As evidenced by the inventory taken of my medicine cabinet, I haven't got a handful of anything that would induce the Sleep of Ages.  I had two aunts that killed themselves.  One, who had Parkinson's and could barely hold a soupspoon, shot herself.  She didn't have to, but she thought she did.  The other was 98 years old and always said that when she got tired of it all, she'd walk all the way to the end of the pier behind her house and jump in the river.  That's where they found her.  Can't really blame either of them.  But, as I said, the gun thing horrifies me and, while drowning seems somehow more palatable, the East River's filthy and out of the question and the Hudson doesn't look like it would do the job.  I mean, I  can  swim.  So what does it mean?  Does it mean I don't have the courage of my convictions?  Possibly.  Does it mean that I'm a big pussy?  Sure, okay.  Does it mean that I want to live.  I don't know.  No.  Yes.  I don't know.  I had a few dreams last night, as you might imagine.  The one I remember the most took place in my apartment.  It didn't look like the apartment I live in now, but it was meant to be in the dream.  I've dreamt of living in that apartment before and always before there were rooms and areas within the apartment that I'd never come across before that dream.  This was no different.  In this dream I first noticed that my apartment was empty.  Then I noticed that the service entrance (which actually looked like the service entrance in my real apartment) was open and some of my belongings were stacked there.  I panicked and went back inside to see what was missing...nothing seemed to be.  I then wandered into the back service hallway and saw through a hallway that doesn't really exist, some neighbors I'd never seen before.  One looked cute and was wearing briefs.  I thought I'd get a better look if I went to the window in the back bedroom.  I walked through the apartment to a room I had forgotten even existed.  It wasn't really big enough to be a bedroom, but it was slightly elevated and had windows all the way across the back wall.  Then I realized that they weren't just windows, but sliding doors.  How had I never noticed that?  I stepped up into that room, slid the door open and stepped onto a small terrace I also hadn't known was there.  The sun hit this terrace through some trees and it was so warming and pleasant that I stood there for a few minutes soaking up the heat.  Then I looked around.  Apparently in all the time I'd forgotten to check this back room, they'd built a pool.  Full-size, in-ground pool.  And all the apartments on my floor opened onto this pool area, which was white stucco, with pale brick accents.  And flooded with light.  The neighbor I had seen before was swimming in it, and others were gardening on their terraces, etc.  I thought to myself, 'I can't believe I'm leaving here now that there's this beautiful warm terrace and a pool to enjoy, especially just as summer's starting.'  I also remember wondering how long it had been there, and that I could've been enjoying it all this time.  None of my neighbors seemed surprised to see me, although I didn't recognize any of them.  I remember starting down the stairs from my terrace towards the pool to check the water, and then I don't remember anything else.  Closer to dawn, I remember being half awake while this rapid-fire slide show went off in my head.  So fast that not a single image remains.  It was disorienting in it's speed and also in the fact that each image contained some full emotion that hit me fully but moved on with the next image/feeling.  I don't remember any of it specifically, just that it happened.  I couldn't get my ass out of bed this morning.  My angelic puffin (who's real name is Dexter and who said to me in a dream several nights ago that he didn't like the pseudonym 'Rex' because it made him sound common and he didn't need his anonymity protected) stood worried guard over me until I managed to sit up.  We took a short walk, I made us breakfast, I packed some books, I sat on the sofa and cried.  Finally, I made the call I'd been dreading.  I called the landlord to tell him that, even though I'd promised to get him this money by the end of the month, I just didn't have it.  I said I could send him a check for $800 and I'd work on getting him the rest as soon as I could, but I honestly didn't know when or how fast that would be.  Do you know what he said to me?  He said, 'You've sent in money when you told me you would, and I consider you a man of your word.  So I'll work with you on this.'  A man of my word.  Me?  I don't know what to do with this information.  And this from a man who very recently made me feel that my absence would be worth far more than my presence.  Is he fucking with me?  I got email today from a bunch of people, many of them bloggers, almost all of them people I've never met.  They all said different-but-similar things: that I had value.  These are all people I consider to be interesting, accomplished, intelligent...at least in their writing and in the information they've chosen to put out into the world.  Man, I thought to myself, I've pulled some major wool over an internet full of eyes.  I have value?  I don't know what to do with that information, either.  Jesus H., I just got off the phone.  It was JSquared.  Through him, the Universe has decided to pluck me up by the scruff of my neck and toss me into the second weirdest place I could be this weekend:  'I have an extra ticket to the Tonys and the Rocky Horror Tony party after.'  What.  The.  Fuck?  Now 'Happy Couple Party' doesn't sound so bad.  Nooooo, now my option is put on a fake Prada suit that I'll feel fat in and enter the belly of the Showtune Singin' Beast.  I really don't know what to do with this information.  It's not like anyone's gonna say 'what the hell are you doing here?'  I actually think people assume I go to these things all the time.  But what if they ask 'what are you in now?'  Or even, 'how are you?'  I'm petrified of these questions.  Last night I thought I was done.  This morning, too.  I still thought so at the beginning of this entry.  But it looks like, for the moment at least, I have to throw in the towel on throwing in the towel.  I really don't understand it.  I wish I had some sort of perspective or could just get a peek at the schematic.  Something, anything...'cause I just don't understand it.  It's easy to say, 'let go and see where the current takes you,' but it's not such an easy thing to do.  It's not something that makes sense to me.  Faith?  As if.  But given the fact that, strong desire aside, I seem ill-prepared to jump ship at the moment, and the fact that I'm being tossed all manner of weird life preservers, I suppose I might as well just 'ride it out, girlfriend.'  Y'know, I was telling RJ the other night that, no matter how bad the movie or play or book, I always stick it out to the end.  Don't know why.  Maybe it's stubbornness or strong curiosity...and sometimes it's been rewarded.  I guess I should afford my so-called life the same courtesy.",

The bad news is that with the rental car and the deductible, I've spent over $1,400.00.  That really blows.  Thank god for credit cards, but now I'm even deeper in debt and that's not good.  I guess I'm just happy to have my car back and to have this all overwith.  I even went out and gave my car a hug.  How pathetic is that?  More good and bad news, but this time it's combined.  Tomorrow is my birthday.  Yeah, I know, I should be happy.  It's my birthday for crying out loud.  My birthday always makes me depressed because it's one more year that I have spent ALONE.  I hate it.  I don't want to be alone anymore.  One time, I told myself that if I never did anything with a guy (and I'm not just talking about sex here, I mean like kissing... anything...) by the time I turned 21, I'd off myself.  Here I am, two years later, and I'm still a pathetic loser that hasn't done a thing with a guy.  I kinda wish I had offed myself.  I'm 23 (well... damn close to 23) and I'm still a loser.  I don't know why nobody wants me.  It's probably because I'm fat and ugly.  Nobody likes a fat and ugly girl.  I don't know what all the guys' problems are.  I mean, it isn't like I'd be a bad girlfriend.  I actually think I'd make a pretty darn good one.  The pretty girls all take their guys for granted - treat them like shit.  If guys only knew that the fat, ugly girls (and the shy geeky ones too) treat their men the best because they have more of an appreciation for men.  Skinny pretty bitches don't understand that because they can wrap any guy they want around their little finger and when they get sick of them they can just throw them away.  That's not right, but guys fall for it over and over and I don't get it.  I guess it's true that looks are more important than brains or a good sense of humor, I just need to learn to deal with the sad, sad truth.  Please can I be your girlfriend?  I'll treat you nice...",

The past three days have been the worst of my life. I am not a very good writer, but that is why I started this blog. Maybe writing will help?  Wednesday around 11:30am I left work to be checked out at the hospital because I was spotting. After an exam and not finding a heart beat, I insisted on an ultasound. Of corse my instinct was right, the baby didnt make it.  Even though I some how already knew, seeing the screen for myself  (because the ultasound tech isnt aloud to say anything) was to that pointe the worst feeling I have ever felt.  I had no idea the next trip to the hospital wuld be so much worse! My wonderful doctor got to the hospital about an hour after that and explained to me that they couldnt just remove the baby there.  I was to go home and call another hospital in the morning and set the appointment to have it removed and it could take up to a week. At the time the thought of that was devastating. My husband and I went home, made a few phone calls to our parents to let know what was going on, and tried to rest. Although the thought of going to work and going on with everyday life with this baby inside me that was no longer a live, really didnt give me any chance of falling asleep. Around 11:30pm my water broke and I began to bleed.  I called my mother inlaw and asked her to come over and stay with our four year old so we didnt have to wake her and freak her out. By the time she got here I was in very painful labor.  My husband took me to the ER.  I think I was there 20 minutes when I said I have to use the bathroom,  and they let me?  I passed what I thought was more blood clots, but when I stood up I felt it was attached, when I looked down I saw the little face and hands of our baby.  Lucky my husband heard me screaming from the other room and got a nurse.  I was in shock and dont remember some of what happened next. After that they helped me in a room and cleaned me up .  The next six hours I was still in painful labor before the doctor sent me to the OB floor for help. When I did get there they knew nothing and though the baby was still inside of me,  it was by far the worst hospital experience.  I have never felt so helpless! So, the OB floor sent me back to the ER for another couple of hours,  when finaly an OB surgon came to talk to us and treat me.  By the time my surgery was finished and I recovered it was after 5:00pm. Seventeen hours we were there!  Strange how much a mother can love an unborn baby so much in just four and half months,  I will NEVER forget the very fast moment I saw that little face.  I just wish I could have done something to save it.",

Sunday, Charlie caught herself on barbed wire and opened a two inch gash on her left flank, 3 hours and $172 at the vet. Sunday night, found lump in left breast. Monday dr, Thursday needle biopsy, results this morning non-malignant pre-cancerous tumor, lumpectomy scheduled for Aug. 21. Emotions run last week, fear, anger, helplessness, more anger, denial (mixed with a bottle of Merlot can be very effective anesthesia.) Emotions today, happy, gratitude, relief, might have to try the Captain Morgan's thing and party tonight. Sarah's teacher's 6-week old baby girl died Wednesday morning, Mayor of Panhandle died Wednesday night. Went to both funerals on Friday. Spent Saturday moving my grandma into hospice, Sunday confessing to Roy what is going on medically. Spent Sunday night making up to him for not telling him sooner. This morning things settled down enough physically, mentally and emotionally for me to come back here and make my presence felt. Once again, thanks for missing me. On a darker note, DO NOT send Geraldo to look for me. I have a stun gun  and I'm not afraid to use it.  Quick notes in response to some of your postings this last week.  Nan - One word for you and your husband: grandchildren. KidLight - all the fun, none of the responsibility. You guys probably don't have too many more years to wait. I also suffer from hypothyroidism. First clue: falling asleep in the toilet at work with my forehead resting on the toilet paper. Repeatedly. Pregnancy killed my thyroid. Still carrying the weight I gained with Sarah. Actually lost weight with Jaylee. Hyperemetosis. Killer Oompas. My dog keeps bringing us rabbits and rabbit parts. Sarah got a hold of one and brought it into the house. 'Look, rabbit.' At a glance, I thought it was one of her toys. The blood dripping from it's mouth begged a closer look. Ah, kids. Are you sure you don't want another one?  Jan - So glad you're not TB positive. That could really wreck your social life. Famous TB sufferers: Doc Holliday (one of Val Kilmer's best roles), Satine from Moulin Rouge (probably one of the most attractive cases of 'consumtion'), and I believe Queen Victoria died of TB. Or syphillis, which is something I'm thinking you're not too worried about.  Sherry - so you're husband fancies Angelina Jolie. Just remind him with whom she was last 'intimate' and that should gross him out enough. I would have liked to see the American Idol concert, but only if Joshua Gracin was able to participate. I knew he wasn't the best up there, but darned if I didn't try to keep him going. God bless redial.  Nat - I've heard that 'sssssss-POP-gush' sound at 3 in the morning. Both girls were home with pink eye and the hot water hose to the kitchen sink ruptured. I was getting their meds when it blew. Couldn't see to turn it off under the sink so had to turn the intake to the hot water heater off and wait for it to empty into the kitchen floor. Why don't these things ever happen during daylight hours? Glad to hear you have a good sump pump.  Jayel - I loved Eric Shawn's 'total coverage' of the Iraqi ambassador. The other guy I love to watch that is underappreciated is Campaign Carl. You don't have to be gorgeous to be a FOX Hottie.  As for an apocalyptic world in which Hillary is POTUS and Pelosi is Gov of California, I'll take a page out of Alec Baldwin's book and threaten to move out of the country. So has anybody heard when he's planning on leaving? Does anybody even know what I'm talking about? I'm starting to ramble, so I'll end this and post. It's good to be back.",

Well my Ruthy isn't there anymore, that's exactly what I was afraid of. She passed away a couple of months ago, I guess it's a good thing because she wanted to go. She said that what's the point of living when you are ninety-one and you've already lived a full life? I loved her so much, I loved sitting and listening to her tell me stories of how she was a pastor's daughter, and how her momma was a singer. She would sometime forget what she told me in the middle of a sentence and tell the story all over again but it didn't matter.  She was a stinker, she wouldn't let anyone in to talk to her besides me and a few others. She never went to the activities we had going on, so sometimes I would sing to her songs that we sang at the sing-a-long, she would always ask how old I was because I shouldn't know those songs because I am too young. She loved to read and spell, I took her to a spelling contest that the other residents where doing but it was no competition because she knew every word, and I even looked a hard one up in the dictionary! My favorite thing about her was she had one tooth, she said that as long as she has that one she doesn't need to get dentures. She also said that her dad told her that if you rub gin on your gums you'd get a whole third set of teeth, so she was waiting for her third set to get in.  Her favorite thing to eat was green olives, chocolate, and cheese so of course I would spoil her when she was running low. She also told me that she wished her father could have met me cuz he would like me a lot, I loved to look in her eyes when she said that because you could see how much she loved me then. I could sit and hold her hand forever. I could of had one more chance if I went sooner to see her. She will always hold a special place in my heart, she will be my Ruthy.

I stood up when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady beaming up at me with a smile that lit up her entire being. She said, 'Hi handsome. My name is Rose. I'm eighty-seven years old. Can I give you a hug?' I laughed and enthusiastically  responded, 'Of course you can!' and she gave me a giant squeeze. 'Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?' I asked. She jokingly replied, 'I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married, have a couple of children, and then retire and travel.' 'No seriously,' I asked. I was curious what may have motivated her to be taking on this challenge at her age. 'I always dreamed of having a college education and now I'm getting one!' she told me. After class we walked to the student union building and shared a chocolate milkshake. We became instant friends. Every day for the next three months we would leave class together and talk nonstop. I was always mesmerized listening to this 'time machine' as she shared her wisdom and experience with me. Over the course of the year Rose became a campus icon and she easily made friends wherever she went. She loved to dress up and she reveled in the attention bestowed upon her from the other students. She was living it up. At the end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet. I'll never forget what she taught us. She was introduced and stepped up to the podium. As she began to deliver her prepared speech, she dropped all of her 3 x 5 note cards. Frustrated and a little embarrassed she leaned into the microphone and simply said, 'I'm sorry I'm so jittery.  I gave up beer for Lent and this whiskey is killing me! I'll never get my speech back in order so let me just tell you what I know.' As we laughed she cleared her throat and began, 'We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow old because we stop playing. There are only four secrets to staying young, being happy, and achieving success. You have to laugh and find humor every day. You've got to have a dream. When you lose your dreams, you die. We have so many people walking around who are dead and don't even know it! There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up. If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and don't do one  productive thing, you will turn twenty years old. If I am eighty-seven years old and live life to it's fullest each day to achieve my dreams, I will turn eighty-eight. Anybody can grow older. That doesn't take any talent or ability. The idea is to grow up by always finding the opportunity in change. Have no regrets. The elderly rarely have regrets for the things we did, but rather for things we did not do. The only people who fear death are those with regrets.' She concluded her speech by courageously singing 'The Rose.' She challenged each of us to study the lyrics. At the years end Rose finished the college degree she had begun all those years ago. One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep. Over two thousand college students attended her funeral -  a tribute to the wonderful woman who taught by  example that it's never too late to be all you can possibly be.",

        "blog_text": "If Lloyd Dobbler was standing outside my window right now, radio above head, he would be playing “Clark Gable.” Though seeing as this is reality and not a Cameron Crowe film, I am left to fend off my desire to romanticize about everything outside of myself. If anything I figured out one thing, my ideal man is definitely a combination of Bukowski and Dobbler. Which means I am really into eternally conflicted alcoholics. Something about Bukowski is just so hot though, perhaps it is the overt misogyny, the talk of sleeping up against a woman’s ass. There is an obvious celebration of detachment in fantasying about fucking someone so far from everything I actually believe in. But there is also detachment in dreaming of the unrealistic wide eyed romanticism that Dobbler presents. It’s the night in shining armor syndrome. I am still waiting to be saved by a kid with a boom box or willingly used by an abusive addict. It’s this dream of “true romance” that I thought I was impervious to, but have somehow become obsessed with. It makes me cringe. I use to sob over being alone, now I just get frustrated, annoyed that I am still looking beyond everything I have, wishing I had someone to take summer bike rides with. Why is romance with others so alluring, yet romance with the self so difficult?",

There's a strong pull to imagine myself swept away by a larger-than-life romantic gesture or consumed by a passionate, chaotic relationship, even if they clash with my values. Despite my awareness, I crave the emotional validation and excitement they seem to promise. Alone in the present, I can't help but analyze my longing and wish for connection, feeling both frustrated by my solitude and conflicted about what I truly seek.",

        "blog_text": "A week ago I was laying in bed and heard a 'pop-pop' my knee felt like a rubber band being stretched as far as it would go then being snapped. I tried to buy a ghetto brace from Krogers and deal with the pain so I wouldn't have to go to the doctors again. Last Friday the pain got to the place I couldn't take it. My knee was making a crunching/grinding noise not the normal cracking I hear from my arthritis. So Saturday I send countless hours at the ER. They do x-rays and say nothing is broke. Damn it took a bunch of x-rays to tell you that? I need to become a doctor! I stated over and over again I didn't twist it and I could move it. So the doctor plays with my knee for a while scratches his head and says I think you might have torn ligaments and cartilage. So he dx me with internal derangement of the knee, gave me some pain pills, a brace which makes me have to hold my knee straight at all times and some crutches. He gave me a number to an orthopedic doctor to call and said to call them within the next ten days. So first thing Monday morning I called the number the ER had given me and they say you can't make this appointment you family doctor has to call us first and refer you. I made the mistake of thinking this might be easy! So I had to see my family doctor. He plays around with my knee for a while and says he agrees with the ER and wants me to get an MRI then he will call an orthopedic doctor for me. In the mean time I am suppose to keep the God awful brace on and continue to use the crutches. So tomorrow I go for my MRI. In the meantime I have had this stupid brace on my leg which has a steel plate down the back so I can't bend my knee so now when I try to bend my leg I can't at all. So no matter what the original problem was I will end up having to do physical therapy to get my leg working. I know I won't get the MRI results until mid next week so I'm really frustrated right now. There's not much I can do with this brace on. The pain sucks but I try to work through it. My fear is I will have to get surgery and I am not looking forward to the at all. I think 'the wolf' has me pinned down for now but soon I will be back on my feet and kick his ass!  The Lupus scares me a little more everyday. I am 26 looking at knee surgery because of it. I am in a support group and I hear all the stories of the woman in the group. Most of them have had countless kindney problems and many have had kidney transplants. I don't like to spend to much time thinking about my Lupus but somedays I do get stuck in fear of what next. I don't fear death for myself but I don't want my kids to grow up without me. I don't want to be a burden to my family and I often feel that way already. I take pride in doing things on my own and not depending on anyone but every year it seems I become more dependent on those around me. Whether it's for someone to open a jar or for someone to carry things down the stairs because for that day my body isn't working. I hate the fact that some days I just can't do things normal people do. I push myself as far as I can but sometimes my body won't do what I tell it to do. I understand it could be worse but these are my pains I know no worse pain then what I am feeling. To not be able to go out a toss a ball with my son or not be able to brush my daughters hair because my hands hurt doesn't seem fair to my kids.",

        "blog_text": "Hey ppl  The weirdest thing ever happened last night, well i suppose its not that weird, more unexpected than weird. I was at Kates house and we having a D and M when my friend Fiona rang me. She said that we had both gotten an email from Josh. Heres the unexpected part... it was an apologetic email. This is what it said:  Hi,  Look guys i need to say this...  Sorry  I am really sorry. I really am. My life has been fucked up the last couple of months really... maybe longer and im really sorry that i took it out on you. I know it was most definatly not the right thing to do. I admit what I did was incredibly wrong, illegal i believe. And i know sorry doesnt fix it but im just saying it cos well... i still love yous. You guys were great friends and in quite literal terms... I fucked that up. As I said Ive been through some trying times and ive copt a fair bit from people for what ive done to you. My anger has been building up for a long time. Well you would be pretty pissed if you had been moved around in the space of 12 months like a fucken hermit crab (sorry i couldnt think of a better analogy). But it is no reason for me to take it out on you. One more time I say sorry to you. I dont expect forgiveness. All I ask is that you read this and reply. It mite be the first steps I need to help me to recover.  Have a nice day Josh  I replied saying...  Im not really sure what to reply, im not sure if what u said is true, or whether its just another trick. I would like to believe its true, but honestly, i dont have any trust for u. It could be 1 big game, i dont know, but u asked for a reply. So here i am replying, pretty much speechless.  From Lisa  Then he wrote back:  hey i know that you cant trust me. i havent done much for you to trust me. but this no joke. no game. no trick. i would love for you to believe me. but i know it takes time and effort for someone to trust another human being. this next bit is me speaking from the heart about why i was so angry towards you. look lisa you and me were good friends. but you really did break my heart. i was in love with you. i thought you were everything a guy could want in a girl. you were kind. you were caring. you were funny. you were heaps of things. but when we broke up it really hurt me. i turned how you mite... crazy? i have never been the same since then. but what i didnt realise in all my bitterness was that you and me could be great mates. instead i was stupid enough to start fucking that up by treating you like shit. treating other around you like shit. but in times of great need... you were still there. amazing. i can still remember when i walked to your place in the rain, and we had a pillow fight. at that point i remembered all the good times we had together and how much i missed them. so you would of thought at that point i would of changed. but i didnt. i became even more bitter and twisted. when i moved it hurt me. i was far away from friends who loved me. and i took it out on you. and fiona. two people who did care about me. but why did i do that? i suppose it was because you hurt me. i was still bitter about when you broke up with me. i was bitter about when you went out with jim. but i realise now that i was so so so stupid for doing that. i had absolutly no right to take my anger out on you. or fiona. it is seriously something that i wish i could go back and erase. im sorry lisa...  i really am  have a nice day josh... p.s i hope you know i was in tears writing this. it brought back lots of memories. most happy     Neways i g2g buh bye  Lisa xx",

        "blog_text": "I was never a huge fan of Ms. Joplin, until I saw a biography of her on A&E.  When I learned more about her life, and death, I was saddened beyond words.  She was a woman who was a product of the anything-goes 70's hippy sub-culture, but even moreso, was shaped by events in her childhood that scarred her and, I think, made her even more vulnerable to the lifestyle that finally ended her short life.  She was born in the staunchly conservative, country music loving, small town of Port Arthur, East Texas on January 19, 1943.  By all accounts her childhood was happy, but puberty brought on constant battles with her weight and acne.  These two things alone were enough to cast her on the outer fringes of popularity, but combined with her early commitment to the civil rights movement pushed her out still further.  Rejected and made fun of by most of her peers, she sought and found solace in the works of other outcasts ... writers, musicians and artists.  When your society rejects you, you do the obvious: You reject it.  Clandestine forays over the border into Louisiana ... called going 'on the line' ... were a rite of passage, in those days, and one that Joplin was exposed to early on because she ran with the boys in high school.  On weekends, they would load up and drive across the state line where rhythm 'n blues bands were tearing up the clubs.  By the time she turned 14 she knew she wanted to make music her life, and developed a love for blues legends like Huddie 'Leadbelly' Ledbetter and Bessie Smith and at the tender age of 18, she was already singing in local country western clubs in Austin and Houston, Texas.  Late in 1963, Joplin hitchhiked to California, where she became a part of the hippie movement in San Francisco. She quickly became a favoured regular in San Francisco and Venice Beach coffeehouses and clubs.  After two years in California, Janis was out of control, however, abusing alcohol and amphetamines daily.  She returned home to Port Arthur, Texas and her family for inspiration and encouragement.  Re-enrolling in college, Janis excelled in school, but never seemed content.  She questioned her life's direction and attempted to fit in in her native hometown.  Ever the outcast in her hometown, Janis returned to California within a year. Chet Holms, friend and promoter, recommended Janis as the lead vocalist for an existing band known as Big Brother and the Holding Company.  The almost unheard of rock band took part in the 1967 Monterey International Pop Festival in California, where Joplin gave a mesmerizing performance of the blues classic, 'Ball and Chain,' and thrust the band into the spotlight.  On the strength and popularity of that performance, Joplin and band were offered a recording contract with the independent record label, Mainstream.  In 1968, Big Brother and the Holding Company released their first self-titled album, which would be followed by the release of two singles.   The band now a success, Albert Grossman signed on as band manager and nabbed a recording contract with Columbia Records, who bought out Mainstream's rights. In 1968, Joplin and band released 'Cheap Thrills,' which included live versions of 'Piece of My Heart,' 'Ball and Chain,' and 'Turtle Blues.'  The album climbed the charts and quickly secured a number one spot on the Billboard charts, where it remained for eight weeks in a row.  Cheap Thrills went Gold within one month of its initial release, and the band was now billed 'Janis Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company.'   As pressure to perform mounted, the band indulged themselves in high-priced drugs and binges that began to affect their performance and work relationships.  On Christmas Day, 1968, Big Brother and the Holding Company played their last performance as a group.   Later that year, with dreams of beginning a solo career, Joplin struck out on her own.  An awestruck crowd egged her on during the landmark Woodstock festival in Bethel, New York in August of 1969, and Janis made headlines again.   With a penchant for Jazz always at the forefront of Janis' music, she formed a backup group called, The Kozmic Blues Band.  First released in 1969 by the Kozmic Blues Band, 'I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!' would climb to number five on the charts, just as the band broke up.   To handle mounting tensions, Janis had turned to heroin, and her use of alcohol and other drugs had increased, as well.  It was not uncommon for Janis to speak of her drug use openly or perform with a bottle of Southern Comfort in hand.  Recognizing she had a problem, Joplin quit drugs altogether in late 1969, and seemed to reinvent herself with a new group, The Full Tilt Boogie Band.  With a new sound, style of music and lifestyle, Janis seemed happier than ever.  That summer of 1970, Janis received an invitation to her 10 year highschool reunion.  Excited for a chance to 'return the conquering heroine' and win a place in the hearts of her schoolmates, Janis attended.  She brought her entourage and her individual style, she was met once again with rejection and sneers.  To be fair, the media descended in throngs, giving the whole thing a circus-like atmosphere, but it was patently obvious to all who attended and saw the news footage, that in her hometown at least, she would never belong or impress those she so longed to.  She returned to San Francisco unhappy and depressed, but ready to hit the studio to begin working on her new album, 'Pearl.'  Looking for inspiration and an outlet for mounting worries, Janis chanced using heroin during production, and accidentally overdosed at the Landmark Motor Hotel in Los Angeles.  Janis Joplin died October 4, 1970. She was 27 years old.   Janis Joplin's third album was released posthumously following her death. Songs from the album including, 'Me and Bobby McGee' and 'Mercedes Benz' would top the charts for weeks in 1971, and make Janis a music legend. Janis Joplin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and is still today considered to be one of the most original and talented white female blues artists of all time.  To this day there stands in Port Arthur no monument to Janis, no sign on the edge of town stating 'Welcome to Port Arthur, Hometown of Janis Joplin.'  For the most part, that small town seems to like to pretend that she was never born.",

        "blog_text": "A new year - a new page - but the same old story to tell.  I'm not happy - and this is definitely  not  new.  For two years I've held my tumultuous love to Jeff - that has definitely  not  changed.  My music is all played out - the soundtrack to my life is on pause.  Maybe it's just skipping at a slow tempo.  It's been two weeks since he left (this time)...  I don't sleep.  I don't eat.  I obsess about how to help him - how to give him help he never asked for or wanted.  This time it was just too much, too far.  'I can't promise that I'll grow those wings, or get this tarnished halo shining.  But I'll never betray your trust, angel mine.'  Man.  I can't even think - let alone express myself - even to myself.  What am I going to do now?  I'll bet he's going to be hard to get over.  Get over?  I can barely move, let alone breathe.  Maybe it was never right - but for more than two years he's been my world - my  universe !  For all of the names he called me, the nasty comments, grabbing me, throwing me... why does his exit hurt so much?  I guess I just want to know that hate is not his final association with me.  I have tried to convince myself that it really was me being a bitch - but I can't.  I guess I never knew the right thing to say or do.  But, I'll be damned if I didn't always know when his anger was coming.  Somehow I always had something wrong to say that pushed it over.  Please, someone - open the door... I don't think I can stay here anymore.  I've loved - I've lost, and it really fucking hurts.  Although he has left me three or four times before - this is real.  He doesn't call - he even asked me not to take his phone calls - or take him back.  When this all started I thought it was just for fun - nothing serious.  Here was this man, fresh out of a reoccuring relationship... and he really seemed to want me.  Even then I thought he would leave and leave me - I just never thought two and a half years later he would take so much of me with him when he did leave.  I wish I could say I didn't even notice he was gone - but there is so much still here, here in the wake he left.  The wake that is loving Jeff Cole.  I feel his touch, his arms, his lips.  I hear his laughter, his heart, his soul.  Mixed in with all of this is the feeling of fear.  I was afraid of him leaving.  Afraid of him not loving me.  Afraid I was saying the wrong thing.  Afraid I wasn't lavishing enough of myself on him.  How could I even think I was ever what he wanted, much less needed?  I'm not even what I needed.  All I needed was SILENCE!  My own silence.  Not one imposed by Jeff and his sidekick 'Anger'.  I needed release - from me and my life.  I  wanted  someone I could share with - not be afraid of his response.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I love him.  Time.  Just time.  We both need to heal and grow.  And then, if time permits and all forces are aligned, maybe then it will be time.  Until then this will be my onus.  Until that time passes and I start to heal.  It's so hard to deal with believing this is the final end, the last goodbye.  I cannot follow him on his dreams and I most certainly will never be the one to make them come true.  Right now I just hope that someday, some way, somehow, someone will bring Jeff back to me - My Jeff...  God dammit.  He is as limitless as the cosmos.  As unconfined as the universe.  Boundless as the milky way.  But... Small enough to touch  my  world,  my  life and  my  heart.  Jeff has so much to offer - I just hope he can find a way to tame his heart long enough to share it.

There are those who listen to all possible arguments, then attempt to make a rational decision about what they believe.  We've all heard this. Despite this, even the most closed-minded who have heard it simply apply it to those around them (ignoring that they are the very ones the advice is trying to help), and continue to live in ignorant bliss. My obsession has become to reach total internal consistency - having a belief system based upon complete objective, rational thought. The problem is, I can't stop. Constantly questioning everything I believe leads to thought spirals that don't stop until my brain hurts. Maybe nobody can truly live up to the ideal, yet I've been trying to. It's incredibly difficult to form an opinion in this state of mind. I can't truly 'believe' anything, I'm always waiting for more data. When I argue with people, it's always from a detached, playful standpoint; I don't actually believe what I'm arguing for.

With two sources of data, each polarized heavily toward each side, I not only have to question what the data means, but where it's coming from. (The Liberal Media, The Right-Wing Media)  It may be that being ignorant and simply assuming a certain belief is a necessary evil. I see people all the time, everywhere, who walk around with complete and total inner peace, completely assured that  their  beliefs are the right one. (Note: this is why I find I fit to the philosophy of 'liberalism' rather than 'conservativism' - extremists on both sides make the same closed-minded mistake of not thinking about their beliefs rationally (you could also argue that extremist liberals are actually conservatives with a different set of beliefs (this will be the third nesting of parenthesis), but a true 'liberal,' by definition, will be open-minded and analyze all their beliefs rationally).  Not to get too 'Philosophy 101,' but could it be that there is no such thing as completely objective truth?  That was fun.

So phoned them up very apologetically but they were lovely about it.  So did have morning to myself catchin up on writing letters, reading my flatmate's essay, doing a newsletter for Navs tonight.  Then I met up for lunch with 3 girls who I used to do nursing with.  Its really strange because they were the really cool guys who used to sit at the back and basically be 'dead cool'.  I never thought I would have anything to do with them, never knew what to say to them etc (Mel listen to this!)  but then in the second year this girl Danni came up to me one day and asked if we could go for coffee. I was gobsmacked. Turned out she had gone to church when she was at home and believed in God and stuff, but had just totally gone away from it, thought that God was cross with her because she had done tons of not-so-good stuff, slept with some guys etc.  We had a huge chat about it, then I started meeting up with her reasonably regularly and chatting about things and reading the Bible and praying.  It was amazing the change in her. She was stil the same person, part of the cool gang, but she started respecting herself and her decisions, she no longer did things just because everyone else did.  I started sitting with her in lectures and was amazed by how accepting the 'cool group' were of me. I still didn't believe that they liked me but just put up with me because of Danni.  Then they started inviting me out and stuff, I didn't often go, but if I did they would all get really excited.  One time this girl Bronwyn came up to me and said 'you know we all think you are pretty amazing, cos you stick by your beliefs and you don't just merge with the crowd, and yet you don't condemn or look down on us because we don't believe the same or do things you don't agree with.  And you have helped Danni so much, its amazing.  I don't believe in all that christian stuff, but there is something definitely different about you' - I almost passed out!!!  I could not believe my ears (I still don't believe it by the way - well certianly struggle to believe it)  But that has really stuck with me and I can so vividly remember her saying that.    And whilst these girls aren't really good friends and we don't have a lot in common, I know that they actually care and would be there for me if I asked them.  And when I see Danni now, who is going to church, doing sunday school, is even going on a christian camp this Easter, it just makes me smile and feel lovely.  Maybe God can use me even if I'm a bad, useless person!  Am just trying to do some study now (aahh) and then it is Navs tonight.

        "blog_text": "The trip with Stad and Lin Xi ended a little later than intended and was setting me back on my work by quite a bit. Stad and us departed at Clementi MRT station after we missed our station at Bouna Vista. Lin Xi and I reached back hall at around 12 midnight and it was time to work for me. Preparation of proposals to be mailed out to potential partners was to occupy me for almost 1 hour until Ivan came to room while on his way to collect laundry.  Ivan is one of my better friends in Hall and we have a common interest in gym-training. We chatted for almost 2 hours while he waited for his laundry to be ready, and it conjured images when we first met:    It was during orientation and I just gotten to make some new friends - Shih Yang, Ivan, Stad and Praveen. For us, the common interest is becoming fitter and an unusual fondness for physical training. Almost every night after dismissal from a long day of orientation, the 6 of us will gather at the foyer forming up in a circle and start doing varieties of push-ups. 1 year ago, I would have laugh myself silly to even think of exercisins to lose weight, but now I am exhilrated after 30 'diamonds', 30 'standards' and 30 'spiders'. How people can change so much.   This entire idea of the 'push-up club' started when I met Ivan (coincidentally back then was also collecting his laundry) while out on my corridor hanging my clothes. Being the few 'rare' Singaporeans in hall, we sort of identified with each other immediately. We chatted at the corridor outside my room and was soon joined by the rest.    The chat with Ivan was long and ranged from work to WWE and movies. I have to admit that it was a long while since we chatted and I am occasionally lost for topics now. Luckily, there was always gym and exercises to restart the dialogue. In a sense, the chat was very much welcomed as it definitely smoothen that certain amount of friction had arisen after I was appointed the FOC chairperson. I was giving him (Ivan is the Hall president) a relatively hard time during my negotiation with the Float committee back then and one issue had led to another and since then I find it a little awkward to talk with him.  Looking back, it really seems somewhat childish to be bickering over the issues that hogged both my FOC committee and the Float committee. I have to admit the relationship with people from Float, a majority of which were friends, had taken a pretty bad downturn. For Shih Yang, fortunately, things were different and I truly appreciated his friendship and support. Anyway, the chat with Ivan was a welcomed relief and assurance that we are still friends, things I supposed should be back to the old time after he finishes his term as president.  From 330am onwards, I was rushing through all the materials to be prepared for the sponsorship proposals. And it was amazing how long it actually took just to prepare 8 copies of decent proposals. I finished at around 540am and headed upstairs to wake Lin Xi up for her morning flight.  Breakfast was at 620am after I helped Lin xi with her lagguage. I had Nasi Lemak at NUH and a bottle of my favourite yogurt drink. I returned to my room at around 710 and spent the next 1 hour or so watching the WestlemaniaXX that Ivan lend to me - specifically only the Playboy's Evening Grown match - since that was the only one match that I missed.  At around 2pm, I was woken up from my sleep after dozing off from the watching WestlemaniaXX by a sequence of urgent knocks on my door. Apparently, the office knew that Lin Xi had passed her room key to me so that I can check-out her room on her behalf. It was a scandlous affair and it seems like there were many misconceptions by many people about my relation with her. Then again, I would too if I was one of them.   Apart from working hard on the planning of FOC and the theatrical production for next year, I had spend much of past 2 weeks helping Lin Xi with her website. The fact that she had shifted to the room just above mine made our meetings more frequent and it was bad when many of my colleagues stayed at the same block as us.  Anyway, having settled her room check-out, I was to finish some matters of my own - to send out the proposals. I asked for official envelops from Jackyln, only to incur the unreasonable outlash by the hall manager Rose. It seems mightily unhelpful if Rose was to continue precieving resources of hall's ownership as seperate from that of hall's student activities when the financial support we harness on behalf of the hall goes into hall's account.   Since needing to go out to settle my matters, I decided it was good to prehaps meet up with my best friend, Weisheng. I had actually promised to meet him on the previous Friday but had not being able to do so due to some delay in a committee meeting.   After dropping my mails at Bouna Vista station, I took a train to City Hall where we were suppose to meet though that meeting will occur only in another 2 and a half hours. The ride was a good 30 minutes and I was glad to be having some reading material. It was a biannual report on local literature and arts, and this issue explores the micro and macro social interactions that defines 'self'. The first article is a postscript of Chris Mann's lecture entitled 'Engaging the Cosmic Dust, the Shades and the Poetry of the Self'.   The article was well-written and enlightening with its concept of shades. 'Shades', he had stated in the article as spiritual manifestation of others in one self. An individual is an inner, spiritual society of 'shades' that interacts amongst themselves and influence the self. Identifying 'shades' and reconginzing their presence and 'suggestions' is the way to reidentifying oneself. 'How often do I actually realized these 'shades' in me?', I thought.  Weisheng is definitely a 'shade', in fact, it would be ridiculous that he was not since we had been friends for 10 years and confided in each other our feelings and secrets. Not to mention also that in him there was always much to be learnt. I met him at around 645pm or 650pm. When I saw him, it struck me how more fragile he looked compared to the last time.   We walked from City Hall to Clark Quay in 'hope' to meet our long-lost 'friend', Boon Siong and fortunately we did not succeed, hence unfortunately we need to walk all the way back to Fullerton One. At Fullerton One, we had some bites and took time off to chat at Baker's Inn. There were so much to talk about and inevitably, we also talked about Boon Siong and the people we met back in NS days.  We finished at Baker's Inn at around 920pm and headed to the Merlion Park where we sat on some 'arty-farty' post-modernist fancy scupltures that serve as highly comfortable seats. There we chatted more. It seems to me that till now due to some unknown reasons, both us, when it comes to girls, still have this sense of inferiority.   Our final stop was at Esplanade and chat we did once again. It was literally non-stop talking from the moment we met at City Hall MRT, and I guess we would not have had this much to say should we be studying together.   We departed at around 1100pm and I reached hall at 1247pm after a short supper at NUH. It had been a long night.  For two days, I had been connecting with people, a thing I seldom do and that I should try doing more. Like what Weisheng said at Esplanade, I need to open more and when I befriend people, I should sincerely want to do so. For the past 2 years since coming to NUS, I had not made many friends and felt insecure but failing to realize that I had not actually being sincere in befriending people(though reasons of having not attended lessons is one main factor in a sense). Somehow I also benchmarked friends too much with my existing group with Weisheng, Eechyi, Zhang Di, Mark and 'Riders of K.E.'.",

No, nothing's wrong, I just need something.  Catrina rushed through her words, not wanting to waste any time.  I left my address book at the house the other day, and I need a number out of it.  Sure, hon'.  I picked it up the other day as I was cleaning, I put it in my purse so I could give it to you the next time I saw you.  Catrina's mother drowsily spoke these words.  At the same moment, Catrina opened up the underwear drawer of her brureau, looking for just the right pair of panties.  Looking at the clock once more, she decided that time was at a premium, and skipped the undergarments completely.    Mom, the number I need is under Johnson.  Chris Johnson.  Catrina couldn't help but let a mischevious grin pass her lips.  Pulling a short black skirt over her hips, she could already feel a dull throb between her legs.    I'm just finding my glasses...  Jacob, Jeffries, ah, Johnson.  It was Chris, you said?  Catrina began to curse herself for ever letting her address book out of sight.    Yes , mother.    It's 839-2755.  Catrina could hear her mother take in a long, deep breath, as if she was about to say something.  Thanks Mom, got to go, sorry.  Catrina hung up the phone, with only the slightest amount of guilt and finished dressing herself.   She decided on a light, almost sheer, button down shirt.  Her erect nipples, without the trappings of a bra, showed through the shirt, two dark points leading the eye to her rounded, voluptuous breasts.  After pulling on strappy sandals, with a slight heel, she grabbed her bag and headed down the staircase and out the door.     \nSitting in the dark cab, Catrina began dialing the number her mother had given her.  She could see that the cab driver was looking at her lasciviously.  She met his eyes in the rearview window, and uncrossed her legs, teasing the driver with bare skin, and a few light, curly hairs protuding from the darkness.    Maybe you should watch the road.  Catrina said, with a smile.  The driver obeyed.  A voice on the other line answered.  Hello?  Chris, it's Catrina.  Catrina said with a warmth in her voice.    Hey, Catrina!  It's so great to hear from you, babe.  What's up?  Chris had a smoothness to his otherwise masculine voice.  Catrina noticed goose bumps on her arms.    I need to see you.  Catrina felt like she was the top of a roller coaster, full of anticipation and determination.  I need to see you, now.    She could hear Chris quietly laughing on the other end of the line.  She could also hear other voices.  She feared rejection, but was confident that she would get what she needed tonight.  How does 10 minutes sound? said Chris.  She knew that she held a special position in Chris' agenda.  She knew she had power.  Control.  I'm on my way.    \nAs the cab pulled away from the large condominium complex, Catrina hesitated momentarily.  This was not the first time she had been here, but it was the first time she had been here for selfish reasons.    She remembered her first time in the elevator, with Dex, making their way up to the penthouse. Chris' penthouse.  Chris was a successful architect by day.  He, in fact, designed the condo he was currently living in.  By night, however, Chris was a master of ceremonies, of sorts.  Chris held monthly parties for the young, the open minded, and, well, the horny.  Chris was Bacchus reincarnate.  These parties, which were of course through invitation only, featured the finest wines and most delectable food.    Then there was the sex.  The parties were not orgies.  Chris felt that orgies were too primal; too  bourgeoisie .  Instead, he provided comfortable, private (or semi-private) spaces for those interested in intimate companionship.  Some were there to make love with their wives or husbands. Some were there to fuck a stranger.  Some were there to fondle themselves as part of an audience; or for an audience.    Dex and Catrina knew what they getting themselves into.  At least, they thought they did.  Dex had met Chris through a shared acquaintance.  After several meetings, Chris invited Dex to one of his gatherings.    Dex mentioned this to Catrina.  She struggled to contain her enthusiasm.  Dex and Catrina had been dating for over 2 years, off and on, and she was excited to try something new.  Though she and Dex had a very active sex life, she felt they had both fallen into a routine.    So, wearing their most revealing and tight clothing, they set off for the penthouse.  The elevator doors opened, revealing a somewhat subdued gathering of Chris' guests.  A few people, both men and women, were standing about drinking wine, smoking cigars, or sampling the various platters food.  A few more people were lounging on couches and chairs.  Miles Davis' 'Kind of Blue' could be faintly heard weaving throughout the large, open penthouse.    Dex!  Hey! Welcome!.  Chris came bouncing over to where they were standing.  His white, though slightly crooked teeth shone in the dim lighting.  He was, Catrina noted immediately, tall, dark, and handsome.  Like her, he had large, deep brown eyes.  His lips were full, with just a hint of facial hair on his chin.  Catrina was attracted to him immediately.",

For nine months almost I had become known as Joshua Carter for some unknown reason, they placed me as this, so I thought am I a distant relative of Jimmy Carter, or maybe Kimberly Carter, who knew...well now I am officially known as a Carpenter again, which is kind of sad, I think I will miss Joshua Carter, it was fun to be someone else and not have to be me for awhile. Which now brings me to todays entry.      Dead Like Me~      This show is just brilliant, it comes on Friday nights on Showtime. Its about a girl who had absolutely know path in life, who dies in a tragic accident...a toilet seat hits her as she is on her lunch break. Her screwed up family mourns her loss as she is reborn as a grim reeper...yes you heard it GRIM. With a sexy british boy, a former Different World star and a former Doc and some chic that was on a highschool 'Saved by the bell' show on Nickelodeon, they take people when it is their time to go.    So does this mean that its my time to go? Which brings me to the next question..when do we know? I was sitting with the love of my life last night and studying my monolgues while he goes through his computer to clean it up and I see pictures of his formers...I see this one guy that triggers something in me making me blurt out in the midst of Oscar Wilde, 'I know him!' Of course Papi looks at me like 'Huh?' so I naturally say again, 'I know him, his name is uh.....' and I search for the name 'Jeffrey'. His mouth hit the floor...turns out a guy he dated back in March is now dating a guy that I dated back in March, ironic or fate? See its things like that, which make me realize there are signs if your life is going the way it should. You just have to know what they are when they show up...I think God gives us our plans, so I think my life was thrown off track with the death of my father, and the other shit that happened, but its now back on track...I think we get thrown by many things, that is why some of us succeed way before others and some don't...life is a choice and you have to choose the right path...however there are many paths, which could take you way off course. My new roommie and my papi have the same middle name, my ex roommies best friend turned out to be a friend I knew...in a city of millions what are the odds. SO this brings me back to my point about being dead. If I were to die, does that mean I achieved what I was supposed to do..and if so...then what was that? Did all those people that died on 9-11 achieve what they were supposed to do in life, did they touch someones life...somehow I just don't think so, but then you read the stories that are written about them and you see they were amazing people, but when you die, do people make up things about you to make you seem greater than you were???? Regardless when I die I want to come back like Georgia in 'Dead Like Me' and take people to the great beyond when they have completed what they were put here for...so in further...  Here lies Joshua Carter...he was a good man...he will be missed....or will he? What would my obituary say?

Today is the 228th Birthday of the United States Marine Corps. My dad, MGySgt Don Heck, gave 28 years to the Corps. That makes me a 'military brat.' I am so very proud of my Dad and all of the other veterans. Growing up as a military dependent, I was different than my civilian counterparts. It started with school. Going to a base school is different than other schools. In first grade, I had to know my Dad's Social Security Number. I still know it to this day. Riding the bus to school was also different. I rode in either a Navy grey or Marine white bus instead of ordinary yellow. Once in school, we gathered around the flagpole for the raising of the flag and the Pledge Of Allegiance. The hardest part, however, was moving from school to school. It wasn't too bad as long as you were going into another base school. Transferring to a place without base schools was much worse. You immediately became an outsider. Being a 'military brat' also had it's privileges. I got to 'see the USA in my Chevrolet.' I made some great friends. A few I still keep in touch with. Turning 10 and getting an ID card was the ultimate for me and other kids. It gave us the opportunity to go to the 7 Day Store, the pool, and the movies without our parents. Military kids earn and learn responsibility earlier than civilian kids, IMHO. Veteran's Day also makes me very sad. On days like it, I remember back to when I was young. My Dad was often overseas without us. Mom would get out Dad's old reel-to-reel and we would make tapes for him. Talking into the microphone was fun, but it also reminded us that Dad was away for yet another holiday or birthday. Mom would often get emotional listening to what we said on the tapes. I imagine Dad also got very emotional. Even now, Dad still has the laminated photos of my Mom and us that he carried with him overseas. Dad speaks very little about his times away from us while he was in the Marines. I know he has it locked away to keep it from hurting us. I silently thank him for that, but I also wish he had some way of forgetting the harsh memories. So, tomorrow, please remember.... Veterans: All gave some, but some gave all.",

Im a 25 year old youth pastor at a growing church, with great vision and a ton of youth.  So whats the problem?  How could I hate something so perfect, and why did you put youth pastor in quotes?  Let me see if I cant explain.  Besides the normal dreams that a kid has about playing baseball or being a rock star, the only thing Ive ever wanted to be was a youth pastor.  It was sixth grade when I felt the call to ministry, and from then on there was no doubt in my mind that I would be doing ministry when I grew up.  I spent time with as many pastors as would give me the chance in high school and tried to learn as much as possible.  As a sophomore in high school I knew without a doubt where I was going to go to college, because I just wanted to go to the place that would prepare me for what I knew I was made to do.  Even in college I spent as much of my free time doing ministry so as to expand my abilities.  All I cared about was becoming as qualified as possible to do what God had called me to do.  After a bit of searching for the perfect place to start out I landed at a church plant that was on the move.  In the time Ive been here Ive seen the staff go from 4 to 9, the congregation go from 250 to 1400, and the youth ministry grow from 20 to 120.  Were one of the biggest games in town now, and more and more people are coming to see whats going on.  Its truly exciting to see what God is doing.  Sounds great right?  So whats the problem?  I will fully admit that part of the problem is how jaded Ive become over the past two years, but I believe that almost all of the problem lies in the title that is on my business card.  On my card it says Andy Sikora  Director of Student Ministries.  My goal was to be a youth pastor someone who would offer spiritual guidance and care; however most of my time is spent programming and pulling off big events.  My last week has consisted of two meetings about how our programming isnt fun enough for middle school kids, planning out and pulling off two big group ministry events, a battle of bands for high school kids, a movie night for middle school kids, and when theres left over time (which there hardly ever is) I try and plan out the spiritual side of our ministry.    The feedback I get is always about programming.  How can we become more and more relevant?  What kind of environments are we creating for our kids?  What kind of events do you have planned?  Why are there no snacks for the kids?  What kind of thought was put into the prizes for this game?  The times when Ive known that Im doing what God has made me for are when I get to really teach Gods Word, after carefully studying and preparing, when I am sitting with a group of kids talking about what theyve been called to be a part of as followers of Christ, working side by side with students and volunteers as we serve the community, praying with students who are going through some of the worst things Ive ever heard of, or discipling those whove come to Christ from the interactions theyve had at our church.  The problem is theres no time for that.  The ironic part of our programming is that no matter how hard we try, its never really that great.  Kids have so many options around here that they seldom find what were doing to be better than anything they could do at home, school or find on TV or the internet.  In discussing this with my wife she made an amazing statement.  Name one youth pastor that doesnt have to do all this?  The worst part about what she said was that shes totally right.  This is what being a youth pastor is about.  Its about the bells and whistles, the fun and games, the one upmanship.  Theres not much pastoring at all if youre a youth pastor.  So what am I called to be?  What does it mean to be faithful to that call?  Am I a youth pastor or a program director?  Whatever it is I better find the answer fast because everyday pushes me closer to the edge, and makes me feel less and less like I am called to anything.",

I must say that because I was just a babe, I have no memory of injuring my tongue, just family testimony and a series of infinitesimal bumps going across the middle of it, which could just as easily be taste buds. I wasn't even thinking when I told you how it happened, but luckily my mom corrected me, and we're able to set the record straight. I wasn't sitting on a stool, I was sitting on a chair at the kitchen table, and the accident occurred when I tried to crawl up.  I know why I thought it was a stool, though. Of course I have no idea what our home looked like then, except by the clues of photographs, so at some point I assembled it in my head until I had a concrete image of the scene in my mind, and naturally it was entirely fraudulent - but I didn't realize that while I was writing. For some reason I had placed us in the apartment of an old family friend, a place we frequently visited when I was in elementary school. It was there that I used to sit on the stools by the kitchen counter, with my mom, when I was quite big enough to get onto them myself.  When my mom mentioned this, my first instinct was to edit the post rather than posting a correction, but I'm glad that I've had the chance to sort out these assumptions in my head. It's always a strange thing when you remember events in your childhood in a skewed or false way, but of course this isn't something I remember: this is a story I've been told, that at some point past memory I transposed onto a familiar setting, changing the course of things in my mind. This is good news: even if I can't remember it, I can at least be reminded of what really happened.",

I think its time I explain a little about the way my mind works. Most things that affect me I regard with passive agknowledgement. Basically, I admit that you are there and leave it at that. No matter what you do, I simply agknowledge you did it and go on, quietly forgiving and forgetting.   Example:   I need to get from point A to point B:  But there is a problem, an obstacle standing in my way. For our purposes let's call this problem 'unruly mob of freekin' freshmen' or UMoFF:   Now the standard junior would give an UMoFF the 'evil superior being glare' they've been developing throughout their sophomore year. Or perhaps this junior would break out his gas-powered weed wacker and just mow them down. I accomplish my objective simply by knowing the UMoFF is there and where it is not there. Maybe there are holes in the UMoFF and I shall walk through the storm without hitting the droplets. Mayhaps I shall find a point C to walk to and around the UMoFF. Confrontation is unnecessary. Through this philosophy I escape many situations that would only result in anger on both sides. I follow the way of Sun Tzu and win the war without fighting a battle. But don't get me wrong; I'm not a pure nonconfrontationalist. I will confront the problem for 2 reasons: betterment of others and betterment of self. If there are other people behind me also trying to get to point B, I will politely (or not politely) request the UMoFF to move. If I believe confrontation will test my mettle and turn me into a better man (debating, playing the devil's advocate to learn more, etc.) I will do so within a heart beat.   Now assume my plan has failed and I found myself in a negative position. The UMoFF was displeased and I have reached my goal but in a flawed means. Will I be angry or agitated? No! I have believed that your reaction to any situation is a choice. I will be sad, because I have partly failed my duty, but I will also be happy because I have tried not to fail.  If I were to only live this way, I would have a deadly gray and boring life. Nothing would miff me, but nothing will bring me enjoyment. I have decided that throughout it all (it being life), I will look at all the things within it and be glad. How many blind people are in this world that cannot see the good and the bad? The simple fact that I can see is a gift. I enjoy small things: the neon green of a Jesus Freak T-shirt or an aphid, the muddy dark green of my car, the motley of pink, white, and red of my skin.

        "blog_text": "It is always rough when you see bad traits in yourself. Yesterday I was talking to my friend Erin, who is Catholic and has tried meditation through chanting in Latin. She said that she had a very transcendental experience, which bothered me somewhat. What I told her was that I was concerned, because meditation is a powerful thing, and can hurt you spiritually rather than help you if you handle it wrongly, or before you are ready. Don't get me wrong, everything I said was valid. Many people have had their spiritual practices harmed by wrong meditation. The suttas expound carefully that meditation is the conditioning of the deepest mind, and not to be done without careful attention. So I was justified in my answer right? I was concerned for her spiritually, and so I expressed it, right? wrong. Sometime this afternoon the Buddha gave me a kick in the ass. I realized a couple of things very unforgivingly, and saw a very ugly side of myself. I realized first - I developed a superiority complex about being Buddhist. I believe it so strongly I see other people as ignorant and almost...undeserving somehow of happiness. Not consciously, but I did develop that view. Also, I was jealous. I thought maybe she had achieved some kind of meditative state I haven't developed yet, as I am still slugging along, sitting for a half hour every day, struggling with an unresponsive and unclear mind. I felt very bad when I realized this, because it means that the values which I value most - humility and compassion - have been compromised in me. I also realized how easy it is to lie to yourself. I really did think I was concerned for Erin's spiritual safety. But it wasn't about Erin, it was about me. I'm just glad I caught myself.

Seems like only yesterday we were playing around, competing against each other, and making complete fools of ourselves.  Not a day goes by in which I don't think about how life would be different with you here, to help and to guide me, as you had done for 10 years.  We truly brought out the meaning of 'best friends forever'....and it was great.  Meeting you the second day of preschool with Anna, running around the playground and screaming and laughing, has changed my life in a way nothing else ever could.  We were the teachers' pets all the way through preschool, and we entered kindergarten together at Mesa.  I can still remember those sessions where Mattson let us do first grade work, and the worksheet about Donald Duck rowing the boat cracked us up for some silly reason.  Everyday we would mess around and have fun and grow closer and closer.  Second grade year, Wesley came, and the three of us grew even more inseparable.  The fight between you and Wesley had me running around between the both of you....and yet, at the end of the year, we all emerged as one.  We swore to be best friends forever, and only through the later years has that proven itself true.  Your smile and personality eventually led you to become friends with everyone, and though we didn't 'hang out' as often, our bond was never broken.  Our daily competitions for the better grade continued, and I remember the GATE test being pretty significant.....  Everything was going great; we both excelled in every aspect and tossed challenges back and forth, and I can truly say those challenges that you put me up against shaped my life, and I hope mine did the same for you.  Then came seventh grade year.  I had been a constant show-up at all your birthday parties, always held the weekend before the beginning of the school year.  This was the one time I turned you down to go with my family on vacation, and I regret that beyond all.  I still remember the first day of school when we settled in Mekenian's seventh grade GATE class....you leaned over to me and said, 'These are all smart people...I'm not going to be top of the class.'  Even then you showed your impossibly accurate interpretation of the people around you.  The Friday before Spring Break was a happy one; after school, we met at the lockers and said our good-byes.  How I regret not making more of our time together that day.  The Monday back from Spring Break was the polar opposite.  At first, I heard only snatches of conversation about what had happened over the weekend.  Then I heard your name.  Disbelief flooded inside me, denial took over.  Noranbrock broke the news to the class, and there was a stunned silence in the room.  I couldn't believe it.  I refused to believe.  Second period, still in denial, I was addressed by Mr. Lee again about what had happened. The seriousness of the situation bit at me....I was still refusing to believe.  Passing period, from second to third, hit me hard.  I passed by Wesley, and I saw her eyes.  At once, my fears were confirmed.  She had been undoubtedly crying, and I knew there was no way out.  We hugged but said nothing.  The bell rang.  Into third period.  The counselors were there; they came to all your classes.  It was then that I understood -- you were gone.  The truth hit me harder than anything ever had; I broke down.  Nor was I the only one to do so, more than half the class was.  I remember the questions meant to help us.  They did not console me; in fact, they hurt me further.  I realized and began to think back to all those times I could have talked with you just a bit longer, listened just a bit better, as you had always done for me.  Mekenian came over after the counseling, and she comforted me.  Nothing ran through my mind but the last image I had of you; the last glimpse of you I had....running out of the locker section towards Spring Break.  The rest of the day was pandemonium.  Chinese School, which had been your second home, and mine as well, greived as a whole.  No one said much, but the feelings were unmistakable.  The funeral was held a week later, and attended by more than 800, all of whom had been touched by you, Connie, you, a 12-year-old girl who knew and accepted nothing but happiness and victory.  I stood on the second floor, the balcony, of SkyRose Chapel and listened to the various eulogies given by the guests, and it shocked me, though it shouldn't have, the number of people you touched within 12 years.  I had been one of the luckiest, to have known you for so long and been able to talk to you whenever I needed to.  As I approached the casket, I was numb with grief and shock, for I was not yet ready to accept.  I said my final good bye to you.  Last year, this very day, was hard on everyone.  Your garden had been dedicated on the 5th of September, 2003.  The various messages written on the table Calton had brought out brought me into remorse once again, knowing you had done so much for me, yet I did not come close to returning the favor.  Graduation came, and the entire class thought about you as your presence was felt as the names were read off.  You were honored.  We were silent.  And now, you have led me into a new direction once again; this is the most personal thing I have written in quite a while.  You were always there for me whenever I needed it, and, make no mistake, you still are.   Ten Years Just Weren't Enough 'Twas the day back to school  After the week of spring break.  Little did I know I would soon learn something  That would cause mine, and many more, hearts to ache.   The students were socializing,  Catching up on a week's sorth of separation.  And then I heard the terrible news  And thought it a figment of imagination.   Came the words of my first period teacher,  'There's been a loss to the Mesa Robles family,'  'Our friend and fellow student Connie Kao hass passed,'  And it was then I knew it true, and tears came readily.   Of course it was hard on everyone  Who knew of the terrible news,  But it depressed me greatly;  I had known you since the age of two.   I really couldn't see or realize what happened that day,  Teachers and friends knew the bond between you and I,  And they tried to console me,  Each patting me on the back quite fondly.   I tried to listen to my friends,  Sure their intentions were true;  Yet how to replace a best friend  I'd known since the age of two?   That day will stay forever in my mind: April 8, 2002;  And now it's been a little over a year and a half.  There is still nothing on Earth  I would not give just to have you back.

I say he was just drunk and probably made a wise decision in not overestimating the already taxed limits of his balance. Just tell me the truth.  This is not an entry about a woman who wonders where her husband goes. I'm not at all jealous, an unusual trait for a woman that I much admire in myself. I actually do believe him when he tells me he goes out only for professional reasons. He's really quite a homebody. To be honest, I enjoy his evenings away, the quiet, the temporarily suspended monologue he always seems to be engaged in.   So I went to bed at a reasonable hour after a movie about the life of Dorothy Parker and a solitary dinner of salad topped with a lean piece of ground beef. I will admit, however, that I drank too much white wine and smoked too many cigarettes. Lay in bed listening to an Isabel Allende book on tape, then drifted off.   When he came home, he was very quiet, which meant that he was either quite sober or very drunk and fearful of my waking wrath. I slept fitfully until 4:14, when I finally got out of bed to turn off the living room light. I stood looking out the front door into the bluing early morning, wondering what the coming day would hold. I never know anymore. Trying to remain cheerful and smiling, all the while my stomach churning while I wonder how much longer we can go on with only one income.   Returning to bed, sleep is a fantasy. I toss and turn, and as the sky outside the window bleeds from cobalt to cornflower to steel gray, I curl up and hug my knees. Anxiety hits me in waves, through which I try to breathe slowly and evenly. 'I know this, I know this,' I say to myself. 'It will pass.' But I am bombarded with the loneliness of the hour, the possibility of death, of illness, of that lump in the breast.

        "blog_text": "Whoa! So it took me, what, four months to the very day to blog again?  What is that all about?  It's not like I've been busy or anything.  Well, just a tiny bit busy.  Today is a good day.  I just re-read my last post and remembered how sad I was then.  Things are good now.  I'm hoping the trend lasts.  We only came back from Prague and London less than two weeks ago and already we're on the go again.  Yes that's right...we got the good news that we're going to Ukraine next week.  Next Wednesday.  Holy shit.  We'll be gone for an entire month and the goal is to come back completely transformed as parents.  That's the goal at least.  If the 'happy vibes' trend continues, it'll happen.  But that's so fucking hard to predict right now.  So, instead of predicting I'll just say what we're hoping for....we hope to go to Kiev, go to the adoption center, find a child we want, go to that child's orphanage, get the child examined by two doctors, decide whether or not we want to adopt that child and then go to court and adopt him.  That's if everything goes smoothly.  First off...we could get to Kiev and we'll be told 'sorry but we don't have any healthy kids under the age of 8...'  Will we come home with an 8 year old?  Who the hell knows...but I do know one thing...you get an 8 year-old that's been institutionalized all of his/her life and there's  a lot of work that needs to be done.  A lot of repairation...and that's if the child can feel like he or she can trust anyone ever.  Secondly, we could go to Kiev and find toddlers but they are physically or mentally handicapped.  Perhaps they suffer from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Effect.  Maybe they have a club foot...maybe they have a cleft palate.  The question is...what are WE capable of accepting as parents?  What can WE handle?  That's a tough question given that I'm not even a parent yet...  So yeah I'm a little freaked.  I have a lot to think about and a lot to talk about with C.  I'll admit, we have visions of a perfect little puttie---but I'm not apologetic about it.  I've been infertile for four years and haven't had any kids yet...I don't understand why I can't have a fantasy of a Gerber baby like everyone else.  But our decision is going to be based on three-parts medical and one-part gut instinct.  We may find a child over there we fall absolutely in love with and maybe he is handicapped...as long as he is reasonably healthy and has a long life expectancy...  Sometimes I wonder what I'm getting myself into!  I have to say that I wasted two years of my life in therapy...when all I needed to do was get my hormonal cycle back in balance.  Since I've been seeing a naturopath, I feel much less anxious and much more at peace.  Sure I'm stressed about this trip---but months ago, I would have been a walking zombie, freaking out every minute.  Now I feel I'm on a more even keel and hey...I didn't need any drugs!  No antidepressants, no psychological bullshit...it's amazing how much the body affects the mind.  Here my medical doctor is telling me I'm entering menopause and then my naturopath is telling me not to believe that for a second.  I'd like to believe she's right.  So this trip...will be a trip.  Going to a strange country where no one smiles...and bribery is a form of doing business.  A place where I can hardly speak the language (I do know some Russian...though the equivalent of a three year old); a place that is bitter fucking cold in January; to meet people I've only 'met' online...If you would have asked me six or seven years ago if I'd ever go to Ukraine to adopt a baby...I'd be like 'you're high'! But hey...it's an adventure and if it all goes well...it's something I can't wait to share with my kids.  I want them to have access to their culture; I want them to want to meet their birthparents when they're old enough; I want them to enjoy life the way we enjoy it.",

I've heard PLENTY of them.  Most are surrounding an issue or two.  NONE of them are valid.  NONE of them will tell the true character of a President.  Issues aren't important.  I shouldn't have to care if G.W. is for or against Gay Marriage.  I shouldn't have to care if Kerry is for or against Gun Control.  I shouldn't have to care if Bush thinks porno should be on the internet or not.  I shouldn't have to care what Kerry thinks of abortion.  Issues SHOULD NOT MATTER AT ALL.  This is where our country has fallen apart in the last 100 years.  The public has been handing over control of this country to politicians one silver spoonful after one silver spoonful.  By the people, for the people.  That was a belief once.  We shouldn't need a politician to tell us if we can get an abortion, buy a handgun, watch an x-rated movie, listen to obscene lyrics, or anything else.  It is not the job of the government to tell me what I can do.  Just because you believe that abortion is wrong, DOES NOT MEAN IT NEEDS TO BE LAW!!!  If we are to legislate on beliefs and our own ideals, then I move we outlaw all infants.  They're messy.  They can be a drain on society.  They provide little positive input to society.  They are not self-sustaining.  We are close enough that cloning could become our primary source of reproduction.  Sounds silly doesn't it?  Cause you like infants?  Cause that's the way it's always been?  I have news for you, wasn't but 120 years ago that EVERYONE carried a gun 24/7.  Now, you have to jump through 7 million hoops, pay several 'fees,' and be a damn near perfect citizen.  Let's look at abortion.  Everyone has a stance:  Pro Life, or Pro Choice?  Which are you?  I cannot fathom a scenario where I would want my wife or any woman I know to get an abortion.  Abortion is against my ideals.  The idea of it is not pleasant.  I don't have any altruistic reasoning for my belief.  It falls on a scale of not wanting to vomit after I drink a few too many - it's not going to kill me, but is still an unpleasant thought.  With that being said, just because I think it's wrong, DOESN'T MEAN IT SHOULD BE LAW.  Bob down the street might NOT think it's wrong and he should have every right to seek out an abortion from a like minded doctor.  Same for everything.  Guns - don't like them, DON'T BUY ONE.  'Vulgar' talkshows and tv - don't like it, CHANGE THE FUCKING STATION.  Porn - don't like it, DON'T WATCH.    Bottom line, don't tell me I can't do something because you don't like to do it.  With that said, you may be wondering, how do I decide whom to vote for?  Vote the character of the man.  Vote for a man (or woman I suppose) who stands by his decisions.  Vote for the man who can learn from his mistakes (with the exception of your's truly, I'm pretty sure EVERYONE has made one or two of those).  Vote for a man you would be proud to introduce as your father/husband/son/brother.  Don't let one issue decide the vote (hell, don't let just a handful of issues decide).  I do not share the same beliefs of nearly ANYONE on the planet.  In fact, most of my friends have VERY different beliefs than I do, yet I would trust them with my life.  I'm certain all of us have friends and family who believe very differently than we do.  What is it that makes them our friend and garners our respect?  It's the character of the man (or woman).",

I read the Fountainhead, which I finally finished today and have successfully proclaimed to be my Bible:) Although it is as radical in its ideas as any philosophical book could possibly get, the philosophy is integrated in a great, crazy story of an architect: the greatest egotist alive, a man of highest level of integrity. And here is what he says at his trial before the collectivist/altruist world accusing him of being an egotist: 'The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man's first duty is to himself. His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons of others. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes. 'From the beginning of history ,the two antagonists have stood face to face: the creator and the second-hander. The creator lives for his work. He needs no other men. His primary goal is within himself. The parasite lives second-hand. He needs others. Others become his prime motive. 'The basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsion. It demands total independence in function and in motive. To a creator, all relations with men are secondary. Second-hander declares that man exists in order to serve others. He preaches altruism. Altruism is the doctrine which demands that man live for others and place others above self. No man can live for another. 'Men have been taught dependence as a virtue. The man who attempts to live for others is a dependent. He is a parasite in motive and makes parasites of those he serves. The relationship produces nothing but mutual corruption. 'Men have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve, but to give. Men have been taught that it is virtue to agree with others. But the creator is the man who disagrees. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to swim with the current. But the creator is the man who goes against the current. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to stand together. But the creator is the man who stands alone. Men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness the ideal of virtue. But the creator is the egotists in the absolute sense, and the selfless man is the one who does not think, feel, judge, or act. These are functions of the self. 'The egotist in the absolute sense is not the man who sacrifices others. He is the man who stands above the need of using others in any manner. He does not function through them. He is not concerned with them in any primary matter. Not in his aim, not in his motive, not in his thinking, not in his desires, not in the source of his energy. He does not exist for any other man - and he asks no other man to exist for him. This is the only form of brotherhood and mutual respect possible between men. 'You can fake virtue for an audience. You can't fake it in you own eyes. Your ego is the strictest judge. It's easier to donate a few thousand to charity and think oneself noble than to base self-respect on personal standards of personal achievement.' 'People are not really struggling even for material wealth, but for the second-hander's delusion - prestige. They don't say 'This is what I wanted because I wanted it, not because it made my neighbors gape at me.' The only cardinal evil on earth is that of placing your prime concern within other men. If one doesn't respect oneself one can have neither love nor respect for others. 'The only thing that matters, my goal, my reward, my beginning, my end is the work itself. My work done my way. A private, personal, selfish, egotistical motivation.' 'I never think of myself in relation to anyone. I just refuse to measure myself as part of anything.' 'I came here to say that I do not recognize anyone's right to one minute of my life. Nor to any part of my energy. Nor to any achievement of mine. I am a man who does not exist for others. The integrity of a man's creative work is of greater importance than any charitable endeavor. I recognize no obligations toward men except one: to respect their freedom and to take no part in a slave society.' 'Is sacrifice a virtue? Can a man sacrifice his integrity? His honor? His freedom? His ideal? His convictions? The honesty of his feelings? The independence of his thought? But these are a man's supreme possessions. Anything he gives up for them is not a sacrifice but an easy bargain. Self-sacrificed? But it is precisely the self that cannot and must not be sacrificed.",

As I was browsing the pages, I noticed Zinn talked extensively about the drafting of the U.S. Constitution.  He stated that the Founding Fathers did not actually want equality ('all men are created equal'), but used the Constitution to perpetuate their already wealthy ideals.  Zinn writes:  'Were the Founding Fathers wise and just men trying to achieve a good balance?  In fact, they did not want a balance, except one which kept things as they were, a balance among the dominant forces at that time.  They certainly did not want an equal balance between slaves and masters, propertyless and property holders, Indians and whites.' (pg. 101).    I guess I never really thought about the Constitution this way.  But then it sort of made sense when I think of Christian doctrine and how that has been treated over the last two-thousand years.  So many people want Jesus without having to follow him.  People want justice without standing up for the oppressed. People want salvation without remaining in the Savior.  I admit that I myself am guilty of this as well.  Sometimes even with the best intentions, people (me) curve ideas and principles toward their own benefit.  Today is Memorial Day.

        "blog_text": "I’m sure some of you are wondering exactly how hard is the road ahead – the one to looking good naked.  Well, I am carrying around 160-pound extra person inside of me named George.  I met George about 8 years ago when I was in a car accident that left me with a concussion.  George came into my life and fed me with comfort food and gave me an excuse to sit in front of the T.V.  George talks me out of all kinds of stuff – “Why not be safe and stay inside today?”  “Who in their right mind will ever buy your candles or like your photography?”  Not that he’s been all bad – George has protected me from getting emotionally hurt, or so he says.  Don did break down that wall, much to George’s chagrin.  George loves to drink beer, to smoke and could live on Mexican food.  He can never turn down a Krispy Kreme, much less a slice of pizza.  During his tenure, he has placed a chokehold on my thyroid, my self-esteem and my willpower. He can’t understand why I feel the need to spend 60 minutes on a treadmill – maybe if the gym would put on the Food Network on one of the T.V.s instead of CNN (he figures the gym wants to exercise your mind in addition to your body – phooey!) In some ways, I imagine him as an older brother – one who can’t pass up a chance to belittle me, but who will always be there to protect me when I need it.  Despite all of this, I have decided George must go.  I like fresh fruit and veggies.  I could actually be a vegetarian (my grandfather, who owned his own butcher shop, is turning in his grave, I know.).  Who am I enlisting to help me eliminate George?  Well, Don for one.  He’s on his own weight loss quest.  We both work out at the same gym, at the same time when we can (he works a lot of night shifts, so it’s usually one weekend day).  He’s doing Atkins, so he gets to eat bacon, eggs and cheese – all of George’s favorites.  I also have a nutritionist, Dr.P, who is helping me develop a healthy eating plan.  My physician, Dr. T, who believes George could be removed surgically (gastric bypass), but who is versed in dealing with stubborn thyroids.  My mom, a former high school art teacher (and an awesome artist in her own right), who believes in my artistic capabilities as a photographer.  My dad who, along with my friends, can’t understand why I don’t have confidence in my crafting.  That is my support group.

And then Catholic Social Thought happened.  Oh yes.  And women's rights came up.  And the paradigm of the family unit came up.  And, that's right, in the year 2003 in a classroom with female colleagues, some of the guys fervently argued that a return to the nuclear family, i.e--one in which the woman stays home and has babies--would solve the world's problems.  Mom--I want to thank you for staying home with me.  I love you.  I respect you.  I know it helped to make me the person that I am.  However, I am not putting myself 100K in debt to have some guy's children.  I was so upset, I was shaking.  Brady, who is used to conservative, National Review toting, Church loving Courtney was highly amused.  And the royal smackdown cometh.  I could not believe what I was hearing...that society went down the tubes when women entered the workforce and started leaving the home.  How do these people make it this far, being this educated and still think that the only way I can flourish and contribute to this world is by using my God given ovaries to bear and rear some man's children?  So I raised my hand, slowly because I was completely enraged. A slight digression is in order.  First of all, this is not what the Church teaches at all.  The Church teaches that marriage is a free and equal partnership in which both parties continually give and recieve love to and from one another.  As both parties are beneficiaries of this love, both parties are called to be active givers of love.  The misconception of marriage that we heard today is not the Magisterium's fault.  Rather, the people who disseminate what the Church truly teaches have colored it to their own advantage.  If you look at prominent Catholic scholars, with the exception of 2 I can think of, they are all men.  Coincidence?  I think not.  But I digress.   I went on to say that the true meaning of marriage is an equal partnership.  That means that both parties recieve in the relationship, but both parties also make sacrifices.  Each must be open to God's word in their life.  Maybe God is calling some women to solely be mothers.  Maybe he's calling them to find the cure for cancer.  I can't decide for anyone else other than myself.  It's just possible I'm being called to be more than a baby producing machine.  Isn't it curious that this entire conversation has been framed in women leaving the home and thus contributing less to the household?  How can the woman who, being called to find the cure for cancer, works outside the home be criticized as neglecting her duties, while the man who works 70 hours a week and only sees his kids when they are sleeping is praised as a good breadwinner?  That's crap.  The reason that marriage has dissentigrated as an institution in the last 50 years is due to a disorded notion and value of self: sacrifice is no longer a part of marriage (well, secularly, anyway).  When you have two people who are in a marriage because of what they get and that's it, it's no small wonder the divorce rate is so high.   This is about equality, and about men finally kicking in and doing more than putting money in the bank account.  This is about equality and women being allowed to flourish in their God given calling as more than incubators.  If the true paradigm of marriage is the Trinity, aren't all parties equal there?  You bet they are.  So eat that you misogenistic, anachronisms.  See, you can be a good Catholic and a feminist...so there!",

I feel a strong sense of responsibility to speak up—for my own dignity and the dignity of other women, particularly when harmful stereotypes are framed as religious necessity.

As to why I think you are beautiful:  To love someone means to see her as God sees her   As to why I married you:  When you realize that you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.   As to why I still go back to you:  'Le coeur a ses raisons, Que la raison ne connait point.' The heart has its reasons, Whereof reason knows nothing  To live is like to love - all reason is against it, and all healthy instinct for it   As to why I do not listen to what others think:  Follow your own heart, Not others.   As to why I accept your kind of love:  No one has ever loved anyone the way everyone wants to be loved   As to why I would never leave you:  For we lose not only by death, But also by leaving and being left, By changing and letting go and moving on.   As to why I miss you:  Every night I imagine touching your face, but nothing is there except empty space. My dreams are filled with visions of eternal bliss, sealed by your tender and heavenly kiss. I awake from my dreams, yearning to hold you near, searching but not finding bringing me to tears. I lie there thinking about how you showed me love, making me wonder if you were sent from heaven above. I fall asleep knowing that you are in my mind and my heart, for love is eternal and we will never be apart   As to why I say we are meant to be:   True love cannot be found where it truly does not exist, Nor can it be hidden where it truly does   As to why we sacrifice the way we do for each other:  There is no work in matters of love -- only exertions of great joy.   As to why I still love you and why I love you this much:  I love thee, I love but thee With a love that shall not die Till the sun grows cold And the stars grow old.

        "blog_text": "Policy – if in doubt … do it.     Over the last seven days I have wondered if this should be posted. For me, it is open head and heart material. The memories and feelings associated with the days before and after 70 wild miles are pretty raw. Maybe what is below should remain in my head but I have a nagging fear of forgetting which kinda makes me go with how I feel at times …..    A difficult decision …  My Mum’s fight with lung cancer had been going on for 12 years. Over the past few months her condition had been getting worse. Gut instinct was to stay at home in Glasgow. Following a conversation with her and my Dad, gut instinct was overruled and I headed north towards Glen Coe.   Pre-race …  When it comes to accommodation in the Coe, the location of choice is to camp at the back of the Kingy. This is more for historical reasons (the Big Yin and I had a misspent youth based here) than anything more practical. Having said that, with and early start from the White Corries next morning, it made perfect sense. Kayak off loaded, tent up and it was time for food and a beer. Maybe a sign of age but I choose the lounge bar with the higher degree of comfort as opposed to the more usual climbers bar.  The alarm went off just after 6:30am and the stove sparked into life for morning coffee. Carbo loading continued with a bag of mini jaffa cakes complete with the “smashin wee orangy bit”.  Up at the White Corries bikes were being assembled, brakes tested, tyres checked …. i.e. much faffing about.  The paranoia about 'was all the right gear in the right transition bag' and 'was the right tranisition bag in the right van' soon disappeared – there was a serious 47 mile time trial to be done … too late for worrying !   The Bike …  47 miles is a long way. Across the Rannoch Moor, on a road bike and 47 miles is closer to madness.   In 1990 I remember crossing the moor on a suzi 600 bandit and feeling incredibly small and this felt worse! Still - heid doon / @rse up and arms onto the tri-bars. After the initial nerves settled down it was great. The 64kmph descent down towards Bridge of Orchy was “interesting” – easy time improvement to be had but at the risk of a bent bike and body in the event of a crash. It seemed like no time at all before the race marshals were warning of the right turn at Tyndrum. The road sign announced that there was 24 miles to Taynuilt and the finish – a check of the cycle computer showed that the sub 2 hour target was well possible. By the time the undulations in the road hit the legs, that target seemed …less possible. With Taynuilt in sight the same computer indicated that the target had been missed and a damage limitation exercise begun with everything possible getting thrown into the last mile or so up to the pier.  A split of 2:05:46 – just over target but the best that could have been achieved on the day.   The Kayak …  Thankfully Iain Burns joined the army and donated a sea kayak for beer and curry. I say thankfully because I really wouldn’t be up for a 10 mile paddle in the wee Riot 007 play boat thing I own.  The mass start was fantastic with boats of every shape, size and type. Watching the brave (and skilled) folks in the tippy marathon boats trying to stay upright helped to pass the time till all hell broke loose and we were off. Very quickly the field broke into those who knew what they were doing … and those who wondered what they were doing. I have heard of magnetic boulders in rivers but the north shore of Loch Etive ??? At one point I hadn’t put a right stroke in for about 10 minutes. All the effort was being put into the staying in a straight line – which meant left, left, left left, left … etc.  My shoulders and back were agony by the time the finish was in view. From a previous trip here I knew there was still a long way to go.  A split of 2:01:26 – again just over the target of under 2 hours (which could have been achieved if I had tried harder in the early part of the paddle ….. AAAARRRGGGHH)   The Run …  Having had a practice run over this section, the confidence of knowing where the three really nasty hills were, was tempered with heavy post bike / post paddle legs. My overall aim was to get under 6 hours for the total 70 wild miles. Fearful of attracting cramp and having to walk, a steady pace was adopted. With each mile marker that went by, the legs loosened off. The superb scenery was added to the bucketful of memories that continue to live in various parts of Glen Etive.  The only downside of the run, was having to jump clear of a minibus and into a ditch – the annoying thing was it was being driven by a race marshall who should know better !  Mile 11 … no point in finishing with anything left over so the pace was increased to everything that could possibly be sustained for the remainder of the distance.  A split of 1:36:10 – better than I could of ever have hoped for.   Post Race …  A quick set of goodbyes /congratulations, car loaded and the journey south started. Usually the race medals go to Mirren. This time I gave mine to my Mum.  About 10am on the Sunday morning, I got the phone call to tell me to get over to the house quickly – my Mum was worse. Early afternoon, an emergency doctor prepared to give a dose of diamorphine to make my Mum comfortable. The effect of this was explained and my dad, sister and I said everything that needed to be said. Overnight, my dad and I took turns overnight in checking on her. Around 6am on the Monday morning we were looking at her still fighting for breath .... and wondering how she was still managing to achieve it  ! I nipped out about 8:30am to take Mirren to school and just before 9am - my Mum died with my dad by her side.  Over the next few days some thoughts about 70 wild miles rattled around the head.   Was it the right decision to race ? For sure – life is about getting out there and trying. If you have your health and fitness it should be used whenever you have the chance … you never know when it might not be there.   Are results important ? Again, I think they are. Without targets to work toward how do you measure yourself ?  What is more important than results ? – your family and pals. Without these people to share it all with, the experience could be empty. My dad summed it up “the best bit about going out on the bike, or into the mountains … is coming home” Coming home has changed forever now.   I also thought about how I had come to take part in 70 wild miles. A quick trace revealed it came from taking up paddling. I had thought about it in previous years but dismissed it due to the kayak section. How did I take up paddling … by meeting Nonie at last years Hebridean Challenge which was due to Rob … which was due to taking part in SAS Jungle … etc …   Like I said … the most important thing about a race is having good folks around you.   On a lighter note …    During the cycle I saw a couple of folks with 'in memory of Mum and Angela' signs on their backs. This broke me and in both cases I passed them in tears. Would of liked the opportunity to let them know 'why' but also kinda like the idea of them thinking ...... 'WOW - how hard is that guy trying that he is crying' !!!!!!!!!!!",

Ugh--I disgust myself with my mindless self-indulgence.  I just reek of lack of willpower (the newest fragrance from Calvin Klein).  So tomorrow I have me shrink and then maybe bloodwork but first and foremost is getting my tire plugged up.  I'm also planning on visiting fellow shipmate, Ms. (p)Irate @ Ye Olde Comic Book Shoppe, and meeting up with Keg-Leg later on.  This will be my first day off in a long time.  Needless to say I'm ready for it!!!!  Tonite I went over to Leah and Rae's with Stefan.  I am once again letting stupid shite bother me that I shouldn't even worry about.  Even Stefan said that I shouldn't care.  The analyzing is about Stefan's new girl and whether or not she likes me.  Stefan is one of my closest friends, even its only been a year that we've really known each other.  And even that silly muppet-lookin' motherfucker said 'don't worry about if someone likes you, worry about if  you like them.   God--its so true!  But I don't even think that way.  Attention Whore, aka Ms. Brickthrower needs to be noticed and loved by everyone.  Ugh...I see these traits in me; I can list them alphabetically and explain them in great detail.  Do I do a damn thing to change them? HELL NO!  Anyway, me and Stefan had a fun time.  Rae and Leah wanted to watch RW/RR INFERNO so that was cool; afterwards we walked back to me car but first stopped off @ 700 Club to have a nightcap and then I went on my not so merry way as my goddamn tire is making me feel like my entire day is ruined tomorrow.  I talked to Jake today.  He is dating this girl Lauren and he sounds SUPER into her and all I can think is 'thank god.'  I just want that goddamn asshole of a former best friend to get his act together and shite.  He told me his HEP count is still high but his liver and kidneys look ok, so they're waiting 6 months and testing again.  If his HEP count is still high they will need to do a liver biopsy.  But he was sounding in good spirits and like him old self.  That is always a good thing.  I was @ work till bloody 6.30pm trying to make sure things were ok for tomorrow.  Even with everyone back on the team, it still felt like hell.  Donna was stressed and I was just so out of it from the night before that I was able to keep my mind off it and just focus on the 6 million bookings I must've put in.  Just the non-stop endless cycle of bullshite is wearing on me and Donna both.  We're both people of order and organization.  Its hard to be organized when everything is changing around you, and people keep throwing obstacles in your way.  I can hear the morning birds chirping...I can't believe I stayed up this late.

        "blog_text": "Kolk, you're wrong.  I don't see how you feel GM changes HM in any way.  Props to your EC stance, but MARRIAGE is as important to gays as it is to straights at least according to this article.  Check it out.  Why The M Word Matters To Me  Only marriage can bring a gay person home  By ANDREW SULLIVAN  Feb. 16, 2004  As a child, I had no idea what homosexuality was. I grew up in a traditional home — Catholic, conservative, middle class. Life was relatively simple: education, work, family. I was raised to aim high in life, even though my parents hadn't gone to college. But one thing was instilled in me. What mattered was not how far you went in life, how much money you earned, how big a name you made for yourself. What really mattered was family and the love you had for one another. The most important day of your life was not graduation from college or your first day at work or a raise or even your first house. The most important day of your life was when you got married. It was on that day that all your friends and all your family got together to celebrate the most important thing in life: your happiness — your ability to make a new home, to form a new but connected family, to find love that put everything else into perspective.   But as I grew older, I found that this was somehow not available to me. I didn't feel the things for girls that my peers did. All the emotions and social rituals and bonding of teenage heterosexual life eluded me. I didn't know why. No one explained it. My emotional bonds to other boys were one-sided; each time I felt myself falling in love, they sensed it, pushed it away. I didn't and couldn't blame them. I got along fine with my buds in a nonemotional context, but something was awry, something not right. I came to know almost instinctively that I would never be a part of my family the way my siblings might one day be. The love I had inside me was unmentionable, anathema. I remember writing in my teenage journal one day, 'I'm a professional human being. But what do I do in my private life?'   I never discussed my real life. I couldn't date girls and so immersed myself in schoolwork, the debate team, school plays, anything to give me an excuse not to confront reality. When I looked toward the years ahead, I couldn't see a future. There was just a void. Was I going to be alone my whole life? Would I ever have a most important day in my life? It seemed impossible, a negation, an undoing. To be a full part of my family, I had to somehow not be me. So, like many other gay teens, I withdrew, became neurotic, depressed, at times close to suicidal. I shut myself in my room with my books night after night while my peers developed the skills needed to form real relationships and loves. In wounded pride, I even voiced a rejection of family and marriage. It was the only way I could explain my isolation.  It took years for me to realize that I was gay, years more to tell others and more time yet to form any kind of stable emotional bond with another man. Because my sexuality had emerged in solitude — and without any link to the idea of an actual relationship — it was hard later to reconnect sex to love and self-esteem. It still is. But I persevered, each relationship slowly growing longer than the last, learning in my 20s and 30s what my straight friends had found out in their teens. But even then my parents and friends never asked the question they would have asked automatically if I were straight: So, when are you going to get married? When will we be able to celebrate it and affirm it and support it? In fact, no one — no one — has yet asked me that question.  When people talk about gay marriage, they miss the point. This isn't about gay marriage. It's about marriage. It's about family. It's about love. It isn't about religion. It's about civil marriage licenses. Churches can and should have the right to say no to marriage for gays in their congregations, just as Catholics say no to divorce, but divorce is still a civil option. These family values are not options for a happy and stable life. They are necessities. Putting gay relationships in some other category — civil unions, domestic partnerships, whatever — may alleviate real human needs, but by their very euphemism, by their very separateness, they actually build a wall between gay people and their families. They put back the barrier many of us have spent a lifetime trying to erase.   It's too late for me to undo my past. But I want above everything else to remember a young kid out there who may even be reading this now. I want to let him know that he doesn't have to choose between himself and his family anymore. I want him to know that his love has dignity, that he does indeed have a future as a full and equal part of the human race. Only marriage will do that. Only marriage can bring him home. \nCopyright 2004 Time Inc All rights reserved",

        "blog_text": "Since January 2000, at least 190 Missouri children have died of abuse or neglect. In a six-month examination, The Kansas City Star has identified 116 of those children and researched their cases.  At least one-third of those 116 children might have lived if only the safety net we rely on to protect our children — family, friends, state workers, law enforcement officials — had come to their rescue when the first sign of danger emerged.  That percentage could be far higher if more details about all the cases were known.  The sad result: funerals for dozens of boys and girls — most younger than 3 years old.  The Star examined thousands of pages of court records, death certificates, coroner's records, media reports and state reports. The newspaper interviewed or contacted scores of county prosecutors, dozens of family members of victims, and several convicted child killers.  Under a relatively new Missouri law, The Star also obtained once-confidential case files for 37 of the dead children — the largest such media request ever honored by the state.  “Accountability is always good,” said Missouri's new social services director Steve Roling, who released the records. “It shows the extent of how the overall system works to protect children.”  Child fatality records remain closed in Kansas, though many lawmakers want to open them.  But child abuse and neglect death rates are higher in Missouri. Although it has twice as many children as Kansas, Missouri experiences at least five times the amount of fatal abuse and neglect, the newspaper found.  Kansas appears to have a low child abuse fatality rate, but the numbers may be flawed, the newspaper found. State social services officials had counted 16 child abuse deaths since 2000, but The Star found 36. After researching The Star's list, officials added eight deaths to their tally, disagreed with one case and are awaiting law enforcement reports on 13 other deaths.  In some years, Missouri's fatality rates are among the highest in the nation. But the state's high rates may be attributed, in part, to its aggressive tracking of child fatalities.  Whatever the statistics, child advocates maintain that society cannot rely on the police and state agencies to protect our children.  Schools need to teach young parents how infants develop and how to cope with crying. Churches and relatives need to help parents find safe day care. Prosecutors and judges must insist on stiffer penalties for perpetrators.  Everyone should report abuse when they see it.  Although the state plays a key role, Roling said, “so do loving parents, grandparents, churches and schools. We're all in this together.”  But unfortunately, not everyone is concerned enough about the welfare of children.  The 116 deaths examined by The Star revealed a sad litany of needless suffering at the hands of parents, boyfriends and baby sitters. Children were beaten, burned, poisoned, shaken, stabbed, shot, scalded or suffocated.  Other youngsters simply were left unsupervised near danger: full bathtubs, vicious dogs, dangling ropes, loaded guns or stifling-hot cars.  Had responsible adults done more, many of these children still would be alive.  Repeated abuse  Preston Vestal was a sparkling 11-month-old whose death Dec. 19, 2001, ended a long fall through Missouri's courts and child welfare system.  Virtually everyone involved missed opportunities to save him from a savage beating by his father, Christopher McDermit.  Preston came to the attention of the former Division of Family Services on Feb. 25, 2001, when he was hospitalized with a fractured skull.  McDermit eventually told police he had struck Preston at their Wellsville home when the then- month-old baby began to cry, police reports show. Prosecutors charged McDermit with felony child abuse.  Though seriously injured, Preston recovered quickly. But resolving the charges against McDermit took seven months and culminated with a plea agreement in October 2001.  Instead of the felony — which would have required a prison sentence of at least one year — Montgomery County Prosecutor Kelly Broniec negotiated a plea agreement of misdemeanor child endangerment and misdemeanor assault. Broniec did not respond to interview requests.  In a hearing so brief that the court transcript consumes just three double-spaced pages, Montgomery County Circuit Judge Keith M. Sutherland accepted the agreement. McDermit, who already had spent three months behind bars, received no further jail time.  At no time in the hearing was Preston's name mentioned nor his condition discussed, according to the transcript.  “I generally don't go into the facts as deeply on a misdemeanor as in a felony,” Sutherland explained recently.  But the judge ordered McDermit to take parenting and anger management classes.  After his plea, McDermit resumed living with Preston and his mother. State records show no follow-up contact between DFS case workers and the family. State officials told The Star they would not discuss individual cases, only state policies.  Missouri's Board of Probation and Parole also supervised McDermit. In the next two months, he missed one probation meeting and was late to another, said Tim Kniest, a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Corrections.  On Dec. 14, his probation officer cited McDermit for probation violations, though he did not deem them serious enough to have McDermit arrested.  His probation officer also had not conducted a home study of McDermit's residence. Kniest said such studies usually are conducted within four months of probationers coming under supervision.  Five days after being cited for probation violations, McDermit carried Preston's lifeless body into a Columbia emergency room.  Later, McDermit admitted striking Preston at least 12 times when he apparently began crying for his mother, who was not home, records show.  McDermit “stated it was hard for him to understand what Preston wanted, and he did not know what he wanted, and ‘Waa' could mean 15,000 things,” according to a police report.  McDermit pleaded guilty and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.  Members of a committee of Boone County child welfare workers, doctors and law enforcement officials were disturbed by the case when they reviewed it in January 2002.  They questioned whether a misdemeanor conviction for assaulting Preston the first time was appropriate. They criticized the judge for not restricting McDermit's contact with Preston.  They urged probation officers to conduct home visits within 30 days to make sure probationers are not living with child victims. They also recommended regular reviews of child victim cases to make sure agencies follow up.  Lana Vestal said recently that her grandson fell through the cracks.  “It seems like there should have been more things in place to make sure it wouldn't have happened,” she said.  In a recent letter to The Star, McDermit said that one week before he killed Preston, he had tried to enroll in an anger management program. But he said he was told he would have to “wait a substantial period of time for classes.”  Defense attorney Kathryn Benson said she and others should have made certain McDermit was receiving medication that could have tamed his volatile temper.  “Everybody involved failed Preston and Christopher,” Benson said.  Warnings ignored  When paramedics brought a nonbreathing 3-year-old girl into a Rolla emergency room in March 2000, a nurse thought the child was wearing “101 Dalmation” pajamas. Then the nurse realized paramedics had cut away the girl's clothes.  Those dark splotches were bruises.  Doctors were unable to save Sara Tibbetts that day. But other people could have if they had acted sooner.  Just three months earlier, Sara smiled innocently as a photographer took her Christmas portrait. Sara then lived with her younger sister and their mother in a trailer home on her grandparents' farm near Blackwater, in central Missouri.  About that time, Sara's mother, Tommie Tibbetts, began dating Daniel Lee Collis, a 20-year-old parolee with a drug problem, state records show.  Soon, Tibbetts and her daughters left the farm. Weeks later, she called and asked whether Grandma would take the girls for awhile.  Sara arrived with a black eye, a bruised face and bruised legs. She walked awkwardly and had trouble sitting.  “She would scream in pain,” recalled her grandmother, Debra Hall. “She couldn't bend over to pick up toys.”  Hall took Sara to a Columbia hospital and told nurses she feared Sara had been abused. The hospital called the child abuse hot line.  DFS labeled the call an “assessment” rather than an “investigation,” which is more serious and often spurs law enforcement involvement. Despite that, a DFS worker told Hall that if Tibbetts came back for the girls to “call the sheriff and then call me.”  However, that worker never contacted Tibbetts or Collis to assess whether Sara could go home safely, records show. Ten days later, in a phone call to Hall, Tibbetts demanded her girls back.  Hall called DFS and the sheriff's office. Both said she must return Sara to her mother.  DFS based its decision partly on a call from Hall's ex-husband, Tom Tibbetts. He said he would supervise Tommie Tibbetts at his home in Belle, Mo. That reassured the case worker, records show.  But Hall fretted. At the farm that afternoon, she begged the pair to leave the girls with her. Sara pressed tightly against Grandma.  “Me stay with you, Maw Maw,” Sara cried. “Let sissy go.”  That was the last time Hall saw Sara alive.  DFS transferred the case to Maries County, where Tommie Tibbetts lived with her father and her boyfriend, Collis, who had notched two parole violations in two months. He was not working, and he was using drugs.  His parole officer referred Collis to a substance abuse program. If parole officials had known that Collis was suspected of hitting Sara, they would have investigated, a corrections department spokesman said recently. But they were not told, he said.  It took two weeks for a new DFS worker to visit the Tibbetts household, and only then with an appointment, not through a surprise visit, which Hall had wanted. Collis was not there when the worker arrived.  The DFS worker asked a supervisor whether to upgrade the assessment to an investigation. The supervisor said no.  Tommie Tibbetts soon asked DFS for help with her own drug problem. But DFS could not pay for an evaluation, the case worker noted on March 14.  That day, a Belle laundry owner learned he had been burglarized. A security video camera recorded Tommie Tibbetts and Collis taking items from a storage room. It also showed Collis yanking Sara's hair.  The laundry owner reported the burglary but refused to give the videotape to city marshal Shawn McKinnon because the owner wanted to find the burglars himself and get them to pay him back.  The next day, McKinnon saw Tommie Tibbetts in town. After recognizing her from the videotape, McKinnon again asked the laundry owner for the videotape. A day later, on March 16, McKinnon received a usable copy.  That evening, Collis killed Sara.  “If I had had the tape a day or so before, I could have gotten charges and had them arrested,” McKinnon acknowledged recently.  Tom Tibbetts, who promised to protect the girls and had wanted to get Collis' probation revoked, spent the fatal day in Texas. He had been there a week.  “The person I blame the most is myself,” Tom Tibbets said, “for … my own inability to see the seriousness and the depth of the danger involved.”  Tommie Tibbetts, who had gotten a black eye trying to protect Sara from Collis in February, left the girls home with Collis part of the day Sara died.  That evening, a neighbor called 911. Paramedics saw Tommie Tibbetts kneeling over Sara on the lawn.  “Help my baby!” she screamed. “Don't let her die.”  Sara's intestines were torn from multiple blows. Her heart stopped on the way to the hospital. Half her blood had seeped into her abdomen, the autopsy showed.  Bleeding to death took an hour, maybe two.  “It was one of the worst (cases) I've ever seen,” said the pathologist, Mary Case, St. Louis County's chief medical examiner. “But how can you measure these things? They're all so horrible.”  Convicted by a jury, Collis received a life sentence. Tommie Tibbetts pleaded guilty and is serving 30 years.  Hall still tries to cope with losing Sara, who had potty-trained herself, adored Winnie the Pooh and loved helping feed the cows.  “I blame myself,” Hall said. “I should have taken off with the girls.  “I blame my ex-husband because he said he would protect them. I blame DFS because they never checked on those girls. I blame the parole board. I blame the Belle police.  “There were a lot of people that failed Sara.”  Family failures  Isaiah. Dayun. Ariel. Ozshana. Katelynn. Josh. Tyson. Wesley. Anthony. William.  When killed, they ranged in age from 1 month to 3 years.  In each case, adults knew that the children lived in danger. Friends, family or neighbors had noticed bruises, rough treatment or consistent neglect.  But they did not tell authorities.  One mother let her 3-year-old son play alone for long periods outdoors near a dangerous dog. Neighbors remained silent until the dog mauled the boy to death.  Another mother watched her boyfriend squeeze her 17-month-old daughter's foot until it bled. The mother did not seek medical treatment because she feared the girl would be taken away. The boyfriend later killed the child.  Today, some witnesses to abuse and neglect regret their inaction.  Dixie Foster, whose great-grandson was murdered in 2001, said people should note suspicious bruises or behavior changes. Her great-grandson, Josh Polson, lived only two years.  “All of the sudden he has bruises, big bruises,” Foster said. “If we just went with our instincts and said: ‘There's something wrong with this picture.' ”  But family members believed Josh's mother, who said she had fallen down some steps with Josh. They ignored her boyfriend when he said he needed help to stop being mean to Josh.  David Manwarren was convicted of killing Josh by shaking him, dropping him to the floor, then throwing him on a couch — all because Josh cried when his mother left.  Al Iantorno grieves the loss of two granddaughters: Katelynn and Megan Duvall. At least one life, if not both, could have been saved, Iantorno said.  The girls' father, Geoffrey P. Duvall, faces murder charges for allegedly suffocating 3-month-old Megan last year in Lee's Summit. He could not be reached for comment.  After Megan's death, Blue Springs police reopened an investigation into her 8-month-old sister's death in 2001. The medical examiner originally attributed Katelynn's death to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, but later changed it to unknown.  Before Katelynn died, Iantorno said he had noticed a black eye and other bruises. He thinks she was murdered.  He also wishes he had done more.  “Katelynn could have been saved,” Iantorno said. “She should have been saved by me. I take full responsibility, and I will live with this the rest of my life.”  Dropped calls  When hot-line calls go uninvestigated, children can die.  Consider the cases of two Independence girls: 23-month-old Alexis Smothers and 21-month-old Breanna Leonard. They lived only miles apart and died only months apart in 2002, both allegedly killed by their mothers' boyfriends.  A neighbor repeatedly heard children screaming in Alexis' apartment and eventually enticed Alexis' mother to say what was happening. The mother's boyfriend had been hitting the children, she said.  The neighbor called the hot line. No report was taken, the neighbor later told police, because she had not witnessed the bruises.  If that happened, it was a mistake, state officials now say. Witnessing bruises is not necessary for a report to be taken.  In Breanna's case, a friend of her mother called the hot line and reported a black eye and bruises two months before Breanna died.  Although she asked to remain anonymous, she provided directions to Breanna's home, the family's phone number and names and ages of family members.  Despite those details, the state worker labeled the call “unable to investigate,” which usually means there is not enough information.  After Breanna died, the caller repeated her story to police. At first, DFS denied any record of her hot-line call. But after a police request, DFS checked its tape recordings. The call had been made.  “I think more should have been done, and that sweet little baby wouldn't have lost her life,” said Amy Bryant, the person who called the hot line. Bryant, who still carries a picture of Breanna in her wallet, said she would not rely on the hot line again.  “I'd call the police first,” she said.  Three years ago, Missouri Auditor Claire McCaskill raised concerns about hot-line lapses. Her audit showed that about a fourth of the calls were labeled “unable to investigate.”  Since then, the number of “unable to investigate” calls has dropped 26 percent, records show. Sandra Wilkie, the hot line's supervisor, said such calls should decrease further as the division makes improvements this year.  But the total number of unable to investigate calls last year exceeded 18,000.  State officials still encourage people to call the hot line.  “When in doubt,” Roling said, “err on the side of calling.”  Fatal errors  Of all the abuse suffered by Missouri children in this decade, few likely approached the cruelty that 3-year-old Anthony Buhr of Independence endured.  Anthony apparently was let down the hardest by the two people who should have cared the most: his father and mother. Both are awaiting trial on criminal charges in his death.  DFS could have intervened, too. But in an eerie similarity to the 1999 Bass case in Kansas City — where two brothers in a set of triplets died — DFS failed to locate Anthony at a critical time.  His father, Frank Buhr, first saw bruises on Anthony in January 2002 after Anthony spent two days with his mother and her boyfriend. In February, Anthony underwent surgery for a ruptured testicle. He had been kicked in the groin at his mother's home.  Frank Buhr won custody of Anthony and his brother, and the court restricted the mother to supervised visits.  About 10 weeks later, though, DFS took a call that Lena Buhr, the mother, again had the boys. A worker contacted Frank Buhr, who lied, court records allege. He said the boys were with him.  DFS policy is to locate children, in person, within 24 hours of such a call. That rule is well-known in Jackson County, because the mother of the Bass brothers also had lied about where her children lived.  Police records mention no other efforts by DFS to locate Anthony.  Three days later, while Lena Buhr was gone, her boyfriend tortured Anthony. Bryon Griffin — now imprisoned for life — beat Anthony with a table tennis paddle, knocked out a tooth and burned his genitals with a hair dryer. He held Anthony's head in a toilet and threw him against a wall. He shook Anthony until his neck muscles snapped and his brain swelled. As Lena Buhr arrived home, Griffin was strangling Anthony.  Ten minutes later, a police officer — answering a disturbance call — came to their door. Both adults insisted everything was fine, according to police reports. The officer left.  About an hour later, police went back. Lena Buhr had called an ambulance.  But first, according to police reports, she waited until she felt no pulse on Anthony.",

I think I'm a good friend and a good daughter.  I think I'm a terrible woman to date.  I'm fun, I am the fun girl. But I'm also curious, and I'm not the most loyal girl out there.  I think there was a time that I really wanted to be a good girl, and I put myself out there for somebody who, maybe in the long run, wasn't worth giving my heart too... I really cared for this person.  Why? I could never tell you...Maybe I saw what potential he had?  I was also a different person,  I hadn't dated any boys for about three years, and then I met him, and I wanted to force things, and I had this idea of how things could be or should have been, and they weren't and I freaked out.  I did stupid things, I cheated, I broke up with him, I tried to get him back.  But he didn't want me. I let him take advantage of me for over a year. Because it was safe, we were both virgins.  But the truth is, we were both children, and I had this overwhelming fear of growing up.    I can't say that that relationship made me a better person. I think in some ways? It made me a worse person too men... It's not like I'm out for revenge? I just can't open up anymore, I'm not willing to put myself out there right now.  So there for, I date men who are emotionally unavailable, or who are in other states and I never get to see them.  I have become so secretive.  I would love to find somebody someday, whom I have this amazing spark with, and there's passion and love, who I can be silly with and who won't take advantage of my feelings, and I won't do that to them.  I want to be an honest person again.  I should no longer linger in relationships that make me unhappy.  But I fear real love like some fear the plague.  But I should not hurt people the way I was hurt.  Just like I should not allow myself to be hurt.    In some ways I wish I could go back in time and be patient, and just have fun and not put any pressure on the relationship I had with this boy, and maybe it could have fully developed, and then fully and naturally failed. Instead of being manufactured, manipulated, and then trashed.  I guess I am partially to blame,  I could point fingers and blame others, but in the end... I put myself through this, and we all go though it. I just am going through this later than most people.   Maybe I'm supposed to just date and be an asshole and just have fun?  Maybe I was supposed to mess up a lot the first time around just to learn what not to do.  I'm sorry to write about this, I'm not being deep so much as I am just venting, and still thinking about this person.  This person who honestly and for some sick and unknown reason still holds a piece of my heart.  Which is wrong. But no one has ever been able to control their heart.  We often care the most for people who give us the least.    I talk about this shit way too much, I really need to get a better hobby.  I need to start acting and being creative?

When the rent check clears, we'll have approximately $300 left.  So I'm sitting here looking around our apartment, and cataloguing in my mind the things that are down  south in storage, and thinking about what could fit in the car, what things are important enough to take with us. Trying to decide if the things that have emotional ties are more important, or if the things that would be more costly to replace (computer, printer) should take precedent. Perhaps the more expensive gifts from my parents (microwave, mixer, digital camera.) The silverware? The pots and pans that I bought with my high school graduation money? Certainly the graphics I've spent hundreds of hours on would go on a CD to be sure to keep, as would the conversations I've logged with friends. And we'd need room for our IRS papers and other important documents.  My clothes and shoes. Some of those would go along, some of it would be left. I don't wear them all anyhow.   Do I keep the books? They're easy enough to be replaced, but there are so many of them. I want to at least keep my favorites, and my web-programming ones.  The sex toys could be gotten rid of, I guess. I don't use them very often as it is. Keep the clamps and the smaller items. The WAHL massager definitely would be packed.  Of what's in storage ... The quilt my grandmother made us for our wedding. Our wedding albums. Leftover wedding trinkets. Marriage certificate. Small gifts my husband gave me when we still loved each other. These things don't hold much meaning now, but they're a part of my past, and my grandmother spent so much time on the quilt, I'd hate to lose it, if only for her sake.   For my husband's part - some photo albums and childhood trinkets his mother sent us several years ago; he never opened the box, it was something I opened when I was packing things to be put in storage. His late father's dress sword from the service (I forget which he was in). His original birth certificate. Newspaper clippings his mother had saved about him. A few legal papers.  More clothes. More books. My cookbooks. All of the recipes I'd collected over the years. More pots and pans.   The things that wouldn't fit in the car - television, desk, elliptical.  So many things collected in the past six years. A few things from my childhood. Not much of it irreplaceable, but all of it with some emotional attachment. All of it just  things .   And I look around and wonder, can I leave it all behind? Could I? Start over completely from scratch, nothing to my name, things in storage auctioned off to the highest bidder. I'm a Taurus, you know, we're quite materialistic, needing the  things  in order to feel whole.  But when it comes down to it, they're not that important. Take the $300, put the necessities in the car, and drive as far east as we can, hopefully making it to my parents' home before we run out of money. Not that my husband would go for that - I've already mentioned it, so I know. I think he'd sit here and rot before seriously considering losing the  things . Not even to save himself would he do it.   And because I didn't listen when I should have, didn't save myself when I could have, I'll go down with him.

On her radio show recently, she said  that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination, according to Leviticus 18:22, and cannot be condoned under any circumstance. The following response is an open letter to Dr. Laura, penned by a US  resident, which was posted on the Internet. \nDear Dr. Laura: Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination ... End of debate.  I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some other elements of God's Laws and how to follow them. \n1. Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves, both male and  female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians.  Can you  clarify? Why can't I own Canadians? \n2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in  Exodus 21:7.  In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her? \n3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15: 19-24.  The problem is how do I tell?  I have tried asking, but most women take offense. \n4. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is, my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them? \n5.  I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath.  Exodus  35:2. clearly states he should be put to death.  Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should I ask the police to do it? \n6.  A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree.  Can you settle this?  Are there 'degrees' of abomination? \n7. Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight.  I have to admit that I wear reading glasses.  Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle-room here? \n8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die? \n9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves? \n10. My uncle has a farm.  He violates Lev.19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend).  He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot.  Is it really necessary that we go to all the  trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? Lev.24:10-16.   Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair, like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws?  (Lev. 20:14)  I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy considerable expertise in such matters, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.  Your adoring fan Homer Simpson-Caldwell",

But if you don’t, or if you attend elsewhere, Mr. Singletary is a teacher who, to the best of my knowledge, loves public schooling more than anyone I can think of. Don’t understand why? Take a stroll by the math wing at about 742 AM, just after the first bell rings. You’ll undoubtedly find him standing on the corner SCREAMING the praises of public education. Every morning like clockwork its 'OFF TO FIRST PERIOD! DONT BE LATE ITS A GREAT DAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY TO LEARN!!! STREATCH YOUR BRAIN CELLS EXCERCISE YOUR NUERONS!! DONT BE LATE BECAUSE IF YOURE LATE YOU MISS KNOWLEDGE, YOU MISS KNOWLEDGE YOU MISS POWER!! ITS A BEAUTIFUL DAY OUTSIDE AND ITS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL INSIDE ITS A GREATTTTTTTTT DAYYYYYY TO LEARN!!' This continues up until the 1st period bell rings. Its quite possible the most annoying, obnoxious and morale lowering events one can be put through morning after morning.   I used to stand idly by and watch this horrid display of over exuberant school spirit, hating it internally and wanting nothing more than for him to blow a vocal chord out so I'd never have to hear his unfounded praise again. Just the other night however I was dreading going to school the next day, and Singletary's voice entered into my head and it sparked something inside of me. I decided time had come for action. No one else was going to tell this guy to knock it off so of course I, being the only one at school to actually care about things I am vehemently against, decided to write him a three page essay depicting in detail the vast array of problems and negative issues of the American public education system. I then sent the essay to Jay and he added a paragraph about socialism in schools today.  The very next day, I waited in the hallway of the math wing for Singletary. When he inevitably came to begin his morning pep talks like a rooster having to crow every single morning, I approached him and gave him the essay. He looked shocked; either that I had the nerve to openly challenge with such an intimidating paper, or that I took to time to actually write it. Whatever the case, he took it, said he'd read it and get back to me.  Just today, I went out into the hallway to see if he was there. He came up and told me he would be coming to my 4th period study hall today to discuss my views with me. This should be interesting. Right now its only 3rd period, but there’s only about 10 minuets left to class so I’m preparing for what I expect to be a heated debate next period, and I’ll add the results in a play-by-play synopsis 7th period when I can access a computer again.  Okay its 7th period now. Turns out things didnt go as 'heated' as I had expected. Singletary came into my study hall period and asked me to get up from my table and follow him into some quiet side-room away from everyone else. He then proceeded to tell me that the essay I wrote for him was one of the most well written and coherent essays anyone's ever given him, including in any of his actual classes. He then explained that he realizes that the system isn’t perfect and is in need of some changes, but he told me that it seems as though I demonize teachers too much for the things we are being taught. He explained that as far as individual learning goes, with class sizes the way they are it would be near impossible to cater to every single person's individual learning needs, and that teachers do their best to ensure that everyone is grasping the material by presenting it in visual (notes and demonstrations) audio (explaining the material verbally) and hands on (projects) methods. He said that most teachers will then review how the majority of the students respond to each method and focus on improving the ones that students dont perform well in. This particular example makes sense, however further into the conversation he started to reveal his weak areas. He touched on the part of my essay where I mentioned that school board officials are all government employees and therefore are controlled by a government who doesn’t necessarily have our education on the top of their priority list. He combated this statement by saying that the school board officials are all elected by the parents and in that way, parents have a choice in who makes the decisions in their school district. Now wait just a minuet, last time i checked the parents weren’t the ones going to school. I told him that I felt as a student I should be able to vote about whose educating me. The obvious answer was that i cant by law being that I'm not 18 yet. As you can see, no practical solution to this problem other than the suggestion that I appear and speak at town meetings was reached.   He then went on to address my statement that I made about how most people who have been taught their whole lives that teachers are the givers of knowledge and on their own cant learn anything new, go out into the world and become complacent followers. To this, Singletary asked me to call state and local town officials and get figures for how many people send in emails, letters or calls opposing or questioning their new policies, laws, programs etc. He told me he was confident that many people do opine to public officials and government representatives very often, and furthermore that these officials care what the people think and use their opinions and views in their own decision making process. I has not previously called and asked this question to any officials so I couldn’t present him with any figures I knew at the time, but I told him that I could say with almost absolute certainty that not NEARLY enough people care enough to make a stand. I gave him the example of a person getting their taxes hiked and complaining to themselves but not openly questioning city hall about the need for the tax hike, and he told me he knows alot of people like that, and he realizes it happens alot. He then offered no actual solution or option to this problem. Yet another issue left unanswered or resolved.  Singletary brought up my comments on how grades dont really reflect actual intelligence in that some of the people on the honor roll are the same ignorant thugs who just figured out how to cheat on a test or 'cram' before a test and not actually retain any information at all. He replied to this with 'In a scary sense, thats actual individual learning in that kids have independently learned how to pass.' So I replied with 'Well doesnt that just defeat the whole purpose of education in the first place in that theyre not really retaining any information you're being taught?' To this he realized he had no real answer and replied with a brief and shady 'well... you dont really KNOW what they retain and what they dont....' and then quickly changed to the next subject ;)  Lastly, Singletary addressed my concerns with the need for certain subjects in school, such as chemistry or three required years of math, or foreign language. I explained how i will never need chemistry in my life, but the fact that i was made to take it and failed, which negatively affected my overall GPA. His answer was well thought out. He said that the reason we have to learn things like that is not necessarily for our career benefit, but more for our overall education as people. He said a real world example would be the issue over destroying the lordship marshes to expand the runway. He said in order to cast an educated vote on the matter depends on your ability to understand the consequences of ruining nature and the effects it would have on the stratford Eco-system. He said without knowledge like that it would be that much easier for the government to control people by telling them whatever they wanted, and without the education to tell fact from fiction, you would just blindly believe them. I told him if that were the case I would like to see real world education courses required in schools such as economics, politics, personal finance, etc. He agreed and said that requiring the all-encompassing 'civics' course was stride in that direction, but is obviously not enough.  Over all I enjoyed our discussion. From the way he spoke he is a much smarter man that I had expected. I respect his views and I must say, out of every pro-education person I have talked to, he had the most well thought out answers. The fact remains however that many problems are still left unsolved, and no one seems to be trying to change those. One thing I will take his advice on is speaking at town meetings from now on. I plan to do so as much as possible.

I walk because I would be broke from having to take a cab every day to and from work.  I suppose I can afford it, but frankly I'm afraid of the cab drivers.  Most of them smell, and they drive like their asses are on fire.    I've grown to enjoy walking to work.  Walking to work in the morning helps to wake me up, and walking home helps me wind down.  It's also enjoyable to walk because I seem to discover new things every day.    Every day I pass by a hospital.  The first time I walked by, I was on the way to work in the last week of December.  They were having a holiday breakfast.  Some relatives were there, but not many.  Most of the patients sat quietly and simply ate.  Some of them took their pills.  I can imagine from the looks on some of their faces that they felt neglected and cast aside.    Sometimes I get asked for money.  The people here seem more subdued than the people I had to deal with in San Francisco.  It doesn't make it any easier to tell them 'no' day after day.  I suppose I can afford to give them money, but I don't agree with the principle.  I work halfway across the continent from my wife, cat and dog.  When I go home, I'm 'visiting.'  I live here in Chicago and I work from 10 to 12 hours a day.  I earn my money.  I just can't bring myself to simply give it away.    Sometimes I think my wife is mad that I'm away from home so much of the time, but she's generally understanding.  She encourages me to do it while it is available.  I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up, though.  I'm tired most of the time even though I try to get a good night's sleep every night.  I don't eat well, and I feel sick most of the time.    I walk home every night a different way each time, it seems.  I used to only walk one way home, but I had to find a different way because I really didn't feel comfortable with it.    When I walked home last night I  passed by a park I never knew was there.  It was a nice looking park, but I didn't walk through it.  I was tired, and it was too dark.    There are 7 drycleaning shops and 5 beauty salons on the walk to work in the morning.  For some reason I don't pay as much attention to what I pass at night.  I keep my head down and walk quickly.    I've only cooked 2 meals in the apartment since I moved in.  Mostly I eat burritos.  They're really good, but probably one of the reasons I don't feel well most of the time.  I like them with green tabasco sauce.    My little sister likes them that way too.  She eats green tabasco sauce on ravioli.  I'm amazed at how much she's like me, and how different my little brother is.  She likes horror movies.  I told my mom I would bring some of my collection over to her to watch, but that's probably not a good idea.  Maybe when she gets a little older.    My little brother loves to play video games.  I can't really bring him over any of the ones I play.  They're a bit too graphic.  There's not really much for me to do here at the apartment.  I'm writing a book, but I don't do much other than that.  Sometimes I like to just sit and rest my eyes.    I feel like I'm rambling, but I'm really enjoying writing things as I think about them.  One thought seems to lead to another, and before I know it I've changed the subject 4 times in a page.  I'll enjoy looking back and reading this.    My novel is about a serial killer.  I don't know if I'll be able to sell it, but it would be nice.  I would enjoy doing something I love as an occupation.  I think I could be good at it.  This first book might not be much, but it will be something.  Something that will show that I'm serious about what I'm doing.  I can't wait to give copies of the book to my family.  To show them that I've done something.    I'm afraid I won't make a difference.  That my life won't mean anything when it's over.  I want to leave my mark on the world, but I don't know how.  I guess I just want to be remembered after I'm gone.  I want to leave something of myself behind for others to see.",

For the uninitiated (and perhaps more as a confirmation to myself?):  Fibromyalgia (also known as Fibro, FM, FMS) is a disease.    Some call it a 'syndrome' -- ha -- but those of us afflicted know the difference, and I won't go into semantics here now...  Here's the standard definition:    According to the diagnostic criteria for Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) published by the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Fibromyalgia patients must have:  Widespread pain in all four quadrants of their body for a minimum of three months.  At least 11 of the 18 specific tender points  Although the above criteria, created for research purposes, focuses on tender point count, a recent consensus of 35 FMS experts has determined that a person does not need to have the required 11 tender points to be diagnosed and treated for FMS.  Many people who have less than 11 of the required tender points may still be diagnosed with FMS as long as they have widespread pain and many of the common symptoms associated with FMS. Commonly associated symptoms include:   Fatigue    Sleep disorder  (or sleep that is unrefreshing)   Jaw pain  (TMJ dysfunction   Post-exertion malaise and muscle pain    Numbness and tingling    Skin sensitivities    Morning stiffness    Irritable bowel    Chronic headaches  (tension type or migraines)   Cognitive or memory impairment    Menstrual cramping and PMS    Dizziness or impaired coordination .      I do have 'all of the above', save for the 'Menstrual cramping, etc.'. That part of my life as a woman is now over, thanks to a quick-thinking Doc's decision and, consequently, misdiagnosis 3 years ago. Turns out my sudden onset of symptoms back then had absolutely nothing to do with 'female problems'. But I paid the ultimate price for his mistake: I can no longer have children, and surgical menopause only exacerbated the awakening FM symptoms. There are a lot of  what-if's  that I could wallow in:      IF only the father of my son had stuck around 12 years ago and 'done right' by us, I might have a better 'support network' now... unlike a perfect family unit (Mom, Dad, the Kid(s)...) I have no one to 'take care' of my son and I as I struggle to adapt to this invisible life-wrecker of a disease.     IF my former boss had only understood and been patient a few more months ... I was 'let go' after too many absences (they won't say 'because of  illness '--they'd be too easily sued).     IF my Mother was still alive, I know she'd be of immense emotional support and encouragement to me these days. We never grow out of needing a hug from Mom...     IF cancer had struck me instead, I know I'd get more support and understanding from family, friends, doctors, people in general... (ouch. know that was a terrible IF to include on this list, but when you're in pain every single day and night, 'terminal' starts to take on a new -- and somewhat gentler -- meaning...  In short, my life has become the 'poster child' of 'before and after':  Before: Even as a  mother  in 1999, I was attractive and dating (several men -- one was 10 years younger than me, a guitarist in a local rock band), going out dancing at least two or three nights a month, working at a local IT firm as Project Manager & Art Director, driving a 1998 Black Camaro with a $1400 stereo system, rollerblading with my son after school, working out at Gold's Gym every afternoon (except Saturdays), weighing in at a perfect size 7, natural dishwater-blonde, writing on my 'great American novel', playing frisbee and/or catch with my son at the park several times a week, I could go on...  After: Fast forward to now, four years later: 80 lb weight gain (size...ummmm, 1/2XX or 22w), hair has grown in dark mousey brown (and can't do a thing with it due to so many meds), no social life, unemployed and financially broken (bankruptcy looms), driving a rusted 'road grey' (no wonder people keep running into me--this car  blends  into the highway!) 1992 Chevy Cav, limited walking with a cane and oftimes shopping from a wheelchair, almost two dozen meds to keep track of (not including the other odd dozen or so that were hit-and-misses), several-times-weekly Doc appointments (five docs), repeated tests/XRays/bloodwork, on the Soc. Security Disability applicant merry-go-round (2 and 1/2 years this June), on Link (foodstamps) along with the standard glowers of disapproval from the folks behind me in line at checkouts everywhere, barely able to check the daily mail, enduring countless nights of less than 2 or 3 hours of sleep, being stared at by little children, run over by young men (who really  should know better  than to bolt in front of a  woman hobbling along with a cane  unless they're planning to  open the door for her  --  instead of  letting it slam in my face  in their sprint to get to the checkout/cash window/order counter before I do)... Hmmmm, I'm sorry. That sounded bitter, didn't it?  Wear my shoes. They flat out  hurt , and would put even Mother Teresa in a bad mood...  It's hard looking at my life ' as it was ' when I am in it, ' as it  is  ' now.  In this online diary (okay, Blog, then) I will try to evacuate as much bitterness from me as possible, and hope I can mulch in in some  hope  as I go. A daily video-cam of me and my life for a few weeks might serve the same purpose (when played back later; I am sure I would be blown away by the ;after' of me, and perhaps work a little harder to soften the edges...), but that would cost money (which I do not have at my disposal these days). So I will do this. Or try to. Depending on how much pain I am in the morning, or afternoon, or evening... This morning was actually a 'good' morning, in that the stiffness wasn't so bad, although my head was pounding (I've had the same moderate-to-severe top-of-head headache now for four weeks -- last week's brain scan looked  okay , so I was sent home to endure this however long it wants to stick around). I did have some odd work to do this morning (promised a former client I would update an ad banner for them--three weeks ago) but put it aside in favor of this (the Blog). I feel a little better for having done so much writing this morning (although the nature of it bothers me a little), but a lot of guilt now for having procrastinated yet another day on an obligation... The downside? As I've been sitting now for almost an hour, it will take me five minutes just to get to my feet, another ten to hobble to the living room, and an hour or two for the pain in my lower back -- and extreme weakness in my hips and legs -- to subside... It was worth it, I guess.",

She encouraged me when I decided to start managing  a band .     she introduced me to my long-lost cousin,  slim moon !  usually people are never around for my birthday because it's two days before christmas, but anna (along with my ex) managed to round up all of my friends and throw a karaoke party for me... two years in a row. last year, she and i went to chinatown together to buy dumplings for the party. it was pretty spectacular, and made me feel loved.   she's also one of the only girls i know who can do high kicks. she also sings that 'thank you for coming to loews. sit back, relax, enjoy the show!' song and dance better than lindsay lohan. she's also the toughest female rock star i know. just check out this photo. too many girls these days just want to look fucking cute and coy. anna is badass. she screams. she writes menacing guitar lines. she tells jokes in between songs. she writes great lyrics. she's BADASS and not afraid to show it.

Due to the sensitive nature of the material, I deleted my original post, and then asked the writer's permission.   I found the message to be disturbing, since it was sent to me, but at the same time, fascinating.  Kind of like a train wreck.... :)  At any rate, I had to read it about 4 times before I fully comprehended it, and I am still not sure I do.  It is, at the least, an in depth view of a moment in a person's life.  I thought at first it was an excerpt from a sick romance novel, but, unfortunately for me, it is not.  The plot thickens....  I went to the beach tonight, and I was standing silently and still with my back to the city and my face and shoulders squared, overlooking the ocean. The wind kissed my face gently, like a piece of satin flowing across my cheeks and over my wide eyes. A piece of my hair strayed across my face, lightly tickling my nose and then just as quickly it was pushed away by the warm satin wind.  The taste of the salt covered my lips and my tongue slipped out to enjoy it.  What a delightful saltiness... I listened to the sound of the powerful waves beating the smooth shoreline, and the distant cry of the seagulls echoed in my ears.  But the sand I remember most.  The cool February sand gently pressing itself against my toes and wiggling between them.  Soft as sugar, but so cool to the touch. Not yielding to the beating it received from the waves, strong and smooth as glass along the shore, so cold and strong.  Not like the wind, the warm satin wind caressing my face and shoulders, beckoning me to get closer to the expansive water reaching out before me.  Yet the sand under my toes warned me of the icy waters so I stayed put. And I just watched, and listened, and tasted. Here, only a few yards from a bustling city full of busy people the sounds of the city were drowned by the beating of the waves and the cry of the seagulls, and the sounds of the wind, the warm satin wind which came from somewhere else.  Somewhere far away, where life is much simpler and a woman can reach out to the man she loves with a soft kiss.  I stood there and warm tears flooded my eyes and ran unabated down my cheeks.  As salty as the sea, but as warm as the wind. My thoughts wandered and I dared to dream for just a moment of what life could've been-do you ever do that?  Live in a world of regret that even the sea cannot drown out.  I could not hear the city, but my own thoughts were loud and clear.  I could run along the beach with the cold February sand underneath me, it is now withstanding the pounding of my legs and still not giving in.  Everyone talks of the powerful ocean, but it is the sand that is stronger. And no matter how fast I run to get away, I am still there. I still taste the salt and hear the birds, but the wind is not so soft now.  Tearing through my lungs and stabbing at my cheeks, the wind is now no longer the gentle touch it was before, but a torture. As is my heart.  - Anonymous",

I think it was sort of random - we had been batting around the idea of getting together (as always), Mom's gone this weekend for another race, and when we were getting shelving and other things in Roch, I asked Dad if we could rent Prince of Thieves.  (I am a bit of a Robin Hood fanatic. Little known piece of trivia no one knows unless they knew me at twelve in the woods.)  So, after spending a few hours raking (and Pippin playing wild Jungle Cat in the high grass that's left), Eric called. So I asked if he could come over.  Yay. ;)  It was nice to see him again. He's got new horror stories from the third graders, and he smelled like wood smoke, which is nice.  So, after he left, I was pretty warm-fuzzied, and feeling elated and girlish at once. Then I learned that, as Mom is out of state this weekend, ride won't be happening. So, I most likely can't go to something I promised Sid. At least, I think I promised. Memory's been a bit iffy lately. Major letdown - I was really looking forward to seeing him again, and I think he was really anticipating it, too.  I feel really bad now, and really, really want to make it up to him.  First impulse was to call him, but he usually works late certain nights of the week. Bleagh. Amanda is smart. So, dashed off a quick note, and halfway through it noticed that my family had once more (yay, thanks family!) dropped my mail off on my desk. Something else from the U of Montana, Navy, glance up - oh....  Got my ACT scores.  Went into mild shock. They're actually pretty good. In fact, they're on the 'really good' end of 'pretty good'. However, I can't help feeling like, with my friends, it doesn't quite make 'good enough'.  This is the problem with knowing J.T. and the Phoenix reasonably well. See, some friendships fluctuate in how close they are. And if you're on the high end of one fluctuation during an early part of last summer, they happen to 'casually mention' their ACT scores to you.  So...I want to go do a morning run on the 2 1/2 mile loop tomorrow around sunrise, but instead, I have work.  And then I get to let my best friend down.  But I'm still happy somehow inside because I got to see Eric again.   And I'm in elated disappointment and shock over my ACT scores.  As Mark would say, 'I need a drink - and I don't drink.'",

        "blog_text": "I think the last few months have been this huge pothole that I hit that made me wake up.  I was just on cruise control down the road of life until then.  Now since Mike's cancer diagnosis and treatment, I am beginning to ask a lot of questions I never thought of before.  A lot of things have been different.   We started hiring babysitters and doing stuff together for fun, because after all, our life was passing our marriage by.  We started 'weekend living' every night of the week.  Enjoy every moment you can.  You know, renting movies and eating homemade cookies.  Until you start craving some balance in your life and missing wierd things like routine and discipline (and a few vegetables).  I'm thankful that God is there to lean on in the things I dont know.  But I have also realized that there is a ton of stuff I don't know and I'm mad at God for it.    I want life to never be the same again since cancer entered it, and I just want things to go back to the way they were at the same time.    Why are the doctors telling Mike he will survive his cancer and telling my best friend's mother that she will die from hers?  Who's life is God at work in?  We're so quick to give God all the glory for one, but what about the other? Does God get the victory in Ms. Joyce's life too?  So many questions, just as many opportunities to trust and have faith.  Is faith faking what you don't know until you talk yourself into it?  Claiming healing when you're dying?  Saying you have peace when you can't sleep?  Saying you trust God in the face of your questions?    I don't ever want to go back to blindly going through life again, but at the same time, I 'd just like one week without the big stuff hanging over me.  It would be so refreshing to just for one day only have to think about what I'm going to cook for supper.  I think I'm losing it.  I'm learning that even when the treatment ends, cancer will always be a part of our lives.  Continuous checks for relapse, always having to deal with it, never being able to put it behind you.  I feel like I took a deep breath last October and have not been allowed to let it out, relieve the presssure,and let that isolated experience find its way into our past.  Instead, I have learned that I will never be able to exhale this one, it will always be a part of our present, a stress that I am ready to give up but don't have the luxury of doing.  Asking the tough questions is tiring, and not getting too many answers is making me weary.  Why am I making such a big deal out of cancer?  We're all terminal after all, and thank God, because then we get to really start living.  Maybe I'm way too satisfied with this life.  Want to feel secure and safe, and in control, like I used to.  But that is a lie/deception from the enemy.  You never really are secure and in control.  You just think you are.  Maybe ignorance really is bliss. But the word says, 'They perish for their lack of knowledge.'  So do I feed my spirit or the flesh?  I'm tired.  This is mind-boggling.  So, I guess I'll continue to say I have faith in the midst of my fears/qeustions/doubts and pray for answers to the tough questions or that they would just go away as mysteriously as they showed up.   I know this isn't a great debut on the blog, but it is kind of nice just to sit and type and get it out. Maybe I can be my more 'put together' self next time.",

My stomach knots up even more than it has been, the churning and tightening getting worse with each jerky movement of the second hand.  I feel like vomiting, but theres nothing to be forced out.  My eyes continually sting with tears that wont form fully and refuse to fall from their ducts.  I feel like Im spinning, but I havent had a drop of liquor to drink.  In less than three hours, a man in full Army fatigues will arrive at the front door of my home at 183 Spruce Street in quiet, suburban Elyria, Ohio, and drive me to my first day of Army Basic Training.  It is November 28th, 1988, and at 5 oclock in the morning, my entire life will change forever.  Sleep is impossible.  I said goodnight to my mother, step-father and sisters around 10 oclock, ostensibly to lay down and rest my body in preparation for what Im sure will be the first day of the toughest phase of my life.  Instead, I find myself lying on my bedroom floor, headphones on, listening to the same song on the same CD again and again: \nThe last night on Maudlin Street \nGoodbye house, goodbye stairs \nI was born here \nAnd I was raised here \nAnd I took some stick here \nI find solace in Morrisseys lyrics, like so many times before.  But tonight is markedly different, the circumstances making the words seem even more poetic and prophetic.  Late Night, Maudlin Street is on repeat in my head, the verses about leaving behind home and family resounding more clearly than they ever have.  I look outside my second story window and watch the impending winters wind move the tree branches, as the song begins again.  Morrissey speaks softly: \nWinter is coming \nWinter is so long \nWinter moves on \nIt is November 28th, 1988, and at 5 oclock in the morning, my entire life will change forever.  I think about what led me to this point, a teenage life filled with moments both equally joyous and turbulent.  Living at three different addresses in four short high school years, leaving old friends behind and making new ones, but tentatively so (after all, why get attached when youll just have to move again soon anyway?).  Bouncing from living with my mother and verbally (and sometimes physically) abusive step-father to living with my father and verbally abusive step-mother.  Living with two sets of parents who offer not a single word of encouragement, praise or hope for the future between them.  Living in an extended family where academic excellence is not something to be recognized and rewarded, but to be met with ridicule and scorn for opportunities that never came for those who sired you.  Living where its not anything resembling living at all, and to stay means one thing: working in the factory and fading to obscurity.  The Army is an alternative to this life.  The Army is a welcome escape.  I didnt think twice as I held the pen in the recruiters office.  I even signed my full name, just for added dramatic flair;  John Charles Blahblah.  Youre in the Army now.  I change tracks on the CD to two songs ahead. \nYou say Break up the family \nAnd lets begin to live our lives \nI want to see all my friends tonight \nIt is November 28th, 1988, and at 5 oclock in the morning, my entire life will change forever.  I think about the true friends Im leaving behind in Bumfuck, Ohio.  Bryan.  Brandon.  Ed.  Adam.  There are others, too  Rob, Marc, Jim and Gus.  But theyre like meno rich, or even successfully middle-class parents who could afford to send them to college.  So, together we made our choices.  Rob chose the Air Force.  Marc chose the Navy.  Gus, Jim and I joined the Army.  Three years later, while home on leave, I find out that Jim was dishonorably discharged after one year of service for mental instability and inability to conform to military life.  I hear through the grapevine that his wrists are scarred.  But thankfully, this knowledge comes later so it doesnt stain my expectations of whats in store for the next four years of my life. \nSo, wish me luck my friends, goodbye \nWish me luck my friends, goodbye \nSomewhere between songs and replayed memories, I have fallen asleep.  I come to realize this only when my mother is suddenly in my room, gently nudging me awake from my slumber on the floor.  Its 4 oclock in the morning.  Its time to shower, gather my things, and say a final, sleepy farewell.  The next 60 minutes are a blur.  I seem to be floating, watching myself do my morning ritual as Ive done it hundreds of times before.  Im soon in the living room, sitting with my mother and little sister.  They are crying.  The doorbell rings.  My ride is here.  It is November 28th, 1988.  It is 5 oclock in the morning, on the dot. \nSo, lets begin to live our lives.",

        "blog_text": "Ngugi wa Thiong'o, a critical person in my personal learning and development was attacked (and his wife) two days ago in Nairobi. It was the first time in 22 years he had been back after self-imposed exile. He lived in London and then moved to New York to teach comparative literature. He was in Nairobi for a one month lecture tour organized by his publishers. He was a writer from Kenya, with books including Weep Not Child (1964), The River Between (1965) The Grain of Wheat (1967) and Petals of Blood (1977). One of the first books that excited me politically was Decolonising the mind: the politics of language in African literature (1986). After 20 years of writing in English Ngugi went back to writing in his first language Gikuyu, arguing that the only way to break from neocolonialism was to develop a subversive literature in languages of peasants and workers. Both his literature and his politics were important to me and he was the one who set me on the trail of thinking about English as an international language. In fact I have a photo of moi in earnest discussion with him at a political meeting in London back in the 1980's. His writing opened doors for me to other post-colonial writers and eventually to more recent writers such as Alasdair Pennycook (The cultural politics of English as an international language, 1994: Longman), James Tollefson (including Planning language, planning inequality, 1991:Longman) and Norman Fairclough (including Language and Power, 1989: Longman). And then, of course, to Fairclough and critical discourse analysis. I never fully agreed with Ngugi going back to writing only in Gikuyu and would be interested one day to find out what difference his decision made - culturally, politically or spiritually to the world. I agree with Pennycook who said: “While it is indeed important to write politically in the local languages of the people, it is also important, perhaps imperative, to engage with the English language. Language is not merely a means to engage in struggle but it is also a principal site of struggle, and thus to take up a cultural political project must require a battle over the meanings of English.'",

His decision to write in Gikuyu sparked my own critical examination of English as a global language and pushed me to pursue broader inquiries into language and power. While I hold immense respect for his convictions, I cannot ignore the importance of engaging with English as a tool for both political resistance and global communication. By sharing my reflections, I aim to contribute to the ongoing dialogue about language, power, and post-colonial identity, asserting my own voice within this critical conversation.",

        "blog_text": "August 1998: Redmond, Washington.  I cautiously approach an arcade cabinet, its phosphorous glow beckoning me in the darkness of the hallway like a siren’s song.  I run my fingers gingerly over the cabinet and feel the spherical mounds of two trackballs, one red, one blue.      “It has no joystick.”  I was struck.  Sigmund Freud would have said that this arcade machine was a woman among a sea of joystick-ed peers.  I say it is beautiful.  I playfully spin the trackball and a naked Medusa comes on the screen, her snakes playfully hiding the more naughty bits.  “Medusa, you tease.” I say.  It’s been over two months since I last saw my girlfriend, 3000 miles away.  I was lonely.  It’s only cheating if it’s the same species, or so I tell myself.  I fish through my pockets for a quarter while Medusa shows me how she’s trouncing one of the other AIs.  Sweat pours down my brow as I find my pockets empty.  Is my tryst with this digital mythical creature doomed from the start?  I begin to despair, when I notice on the bottom of the screen the world’s two most beautiful words: Free Play.  I press the Player 1 button and I wait in anticipation.  Soon, it will be just the two of us… and a colony of slimes?  Noooo!  I play and defeat the colony of slimes only to be assaulted by a fat hillbilly mutant.  It seems that my Medusa is the third opponent in the game.  I defeat Cletus with hardly any effort.  Nobody will stay between and my five minute imaginary fling.  At last, She arrives.  We start playing.  She quickly dominates the field. “So that’s how you like it?  I can do that baby” I tell her.  I turn the tables on her, I make a comeback but she’s relentless.  More sweat pours down my face, my chest, my hands, on the controls.  Each move changes the game almost completely, each move a note in our symphony.  It is anybody’s game.  Who’s going to go first?  Her or me?  Who’s going to come out on top?  Eventually we are done.  Both of us are spent.  I wish I smoked, because I want to light a cigarette.  I give her one last look and promise I’ll come again tomorrow.  Will I?  You bet.  Fast Forward to today...  I’ve been infatuated with the game Ataxx for a very long time, so I decided to make my own version of it with quite a few twists.  I’ll talk about that at a later date when I have something impressive to show you.  Let’s talk about the rules for Ataxx for now.  The game is similar to Othello or Reversi where two players play on a board each with different color pieces.  Just like Othello, the point is to create more pieces and convert as many of your opponent’s pieces as possible.  Tokens can move in one of two ways.  They can slide or jump.    To slide, you select one of your pieces, and you then select any vacant square on the board that is adjacent to the piece.  This will cause your piece to divide in two, that is, you have now 2 pieces, one in the original location, and one in the new location.  To jump, select one of your pieces, and then select a vacant square that lies one space beyond where you can slide.  For example, if you have a piece at (3, 3), it can slide to (4, 3), but it can jump to (5, 3).  Sadly, when you jump, you are moving that piece, it does not divide.  Whenever you place a piece on the board, be it by sliding or jumping, any of your opponent’s pieces that are adjacent to the one you just placed become yours.  Simple, right?  Anyway, I’m developing and testing the core functionality of the game; the rules and AI, if you will.  So that I will not get distracted by graphics, sound, resource management, etc, I decided to create a cheesy, half-assed text-mode test program.  The interface of the test program is crappy.  You have to play with the CAPS-Lock on.   Sorry :).  It was not meant to be played by anyone.  But since my fans are requesting, nay, demanding new content, who am I to refuse.  It runs under Windows.  Have fun, and any feedback is welcome.  You can get the file right here , it's only 47kb.",

My history with Alex is long and convoluted, and seeing him again, it's hard not to reflect on who we were and who we've both become in the ten years that we've known each other. What first drew me to him was that he saw the world in a way that was so different than anyone else I knew, a way that is so indescribable that it can only be defined as 'Alex.' I've seen his interests float from ROTC, skateboarding, punk music, Eagle Scouts, computers, and music. He was always looking for adventure and new experiences and seemed to fit in wherever he went. I'm sure it didn't always feel that way to him, but at that time his humor and confidence was exactly what I needed. Unfortunately I was just coming off my first real, long-term relationship, and it would be an understatement to say that it was an unhealthy one. I was very skittish during the course of our relationship and when the opportunity came for my family to move, I pounced on it hungrily. It had nothing to do with Alex, I was extremely unhappy with the rest of my life, but I think he was hurt by my eagerness to leave. Truth be told, I was so scared that I probably would have screwed it up somehow, so it's probably a good thing I left before I could have damaged our friendship as well. The connection has remained and since then we have gotten together several times, but geography, and my own issues, have kept us apart.  Still, every time we talk or every time I know we are about to see each other, my heart skips a beat. I think that maybe something will happen, something that will indicate that passion, that pull that we had together, but for the first time I realized that that's not going to happen. He was playing his music in this bizarre hipster San Francisco art gallery/club, I realized that we are far too different right now and neither of us has what the other needs right now. Part of me is relieved, I can let this go and Alex doesn't have to be the one that got away. Or more specifically, the one I let get away because I was too wrapped up in my own anxieties and fears. I can love the boy that he was and respect the man that he is now.  The other part of me is nervous. In a way, Alex was an easy answer. He's someone who already knows some of my quirks, my hang-ups, my neuroses. In short, he's someone I've already let in.  And I don't let people in easily.  It's common knowledge that I'm not a big hugger. Or cuddler. Or really very touchy-feely in any sort of way. My aunt once claimed that I have the biggest personal space of anyone she's ever met and she's not wrong. My co-workers call it The Bubble. Anytime a customer or a particularly vile colleague gets to close, they laugh at my visible discomfort and comment on how the bubble has been breached.  But the bubble transcends physicality and surrounds me on an emotional level as well. Something unseen that both separates and protects me from everything and everyone else. In the beginning it was imposed upon me, by both genetics and circumstance. I'm naturally an introvert which is not a comment on whether or not I'm outgoing but how I get my strength. According to my therapist, extroverts gather their energy from being around people, while introverts get it from being alone. Whenever I'm around people, whether they are enjoyable or tiresome, I'm always left drained. So my natural disposition coupled with the fact that for a long time I was an only child whose parents worked a lot, I spent a great deal of time on my own, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Back then the bubble was clear and iridescent, like one freshly blown from the bottle. I could still see and interact with the world, but in my own skewed, beautiful way.  As I grew up the bubble naturally clouded and became harder, tougher. Kids are rough and I've always had what my psychiatrist called a 'tender soul'. I take things very personally and the innate callousness of kids going through puberty forced had me becoming more cautious about who I trust. Gradually I started to gain more confidence and become comfortable in my surroundings.  Then, when I was 15, my world fell apart. The aforementioned unhealthy boyfriend who claimed to love me above all else, turned out to be an obsessive, manipulative, headcase and the rest of my friends abandoned me. I was alone. Most of the time life changes so slowly that you don't realize that things are different, but in one moment that year I knew that I would never be the same again. A heaviness infected my body and heart that day, one that makes it impossible to breathe fully and deeply, one that has yet to completely dissipate nearly ten years later. My anger yelled and screamed, but no one heard. My hurt cried and cut, but no one saw.  And so I rebuilt the bubble until it was hard and opaque; I had learned my lesson. People came and went from my life, some of whom were fun acquaintances, some of whom I considered friends, some of whom were more, but rarely did I let them past the surface level. With each perceived hurt and rejection, the bubble became harder, darker, and heavier. Only once I thought to reach out for help but my cry was dismissed, something I have yet to fully forgive my mother for.  Eventually the bubble became so dark, heavy and oppressive that my world came crashing down on me again. The world was so black that death seemed like the only path to light. And so I took it, or tried to anyway. Needless to say it didn't work, but scared me enough to demand help. The fragile illusion of the healthy, normal person I desperately tried to project was ripped away to expose the mess I had become.  It's been several years and diagnosis since then and I've dealt with or accepted many of my issues, but there are some that I continue to work on. I have great people in my life now, but I rarely let them see the whole me. I don't want to say the real me, because the fun, sarcastic aspect of my personality is just as much a part of me as the scared, pathetic side or the vulnerable, raw side.  But the fun, sarcastic side is a lot more impervious to hurt than the other and I can't completely abandon my bubble. I can't radically change the way that I am just because I don't want to be that way anymore. I need some sort of protection, but I'm not really sure how to not become too protected.  I'm coming to a point in my life where I actually kind of want a relationship that goes beyond friendship. There are times where I actually crave the touch of a man's fingertips as they brush through my hair, someone to laugh in bed with, or a guy who makes my skin flush and my blood heat. But let's face it, relationships are scary and tough. I think that's why I clung to Alex, or the idea of Alex for so long. He was safe. When you love someone as fully as you can, you let them go farther than anyone else, and the prospect of finding that with some unknown person is daunting to say the least.  Adding to the anxiety is the fact that I have the tendency to see the worst in all of the relationships surrounding me. One the one hand it's smart, because I know what I want to avoid in a relationship, but on the other hand it probably adds to the anxiety.  I'm scared of changing the core of who I am for the sake of compromise. I don't want to lose myself in one person to where I toss away any identity that I ever had and abandon everyone around me in favor of that one person. I'm afraid of being hurt beyond salvation because no one knows how to exploit your vulnerabilities more than someone you love.  Quite simply, I'm scared. And I don't know what to do about it.",

        "blog_text": "Hermann Hesse was born this day, 1877, and to celebrate his birthday, I'll post what I wrote after reading Journey to the East and Knulp, respectively. \nJourney to the East \n'Where are we really going?  Always home!' -- Novalis \nHermann Hesse's synthesis of characters real and fictional, a League of artists if you will.  Their goals remain individual in theory, but ultimately remain for the group--the whole.  The League creates a paradigm of spirituality: artistic and beautiful.  The tale surpasses that of any novel concerned primarily with a metamorphosis of sorts--a becoming.  Instead, it relies on the amalgam of Eastern and Western thought: Eastern philosophy--the One, the culmination of all things--and Western methodology--that of art and Platonic idealism, literature and early twentieth century Europeanism. \nWe follow H.H. in his travels with the League.  His personal goal is irrelevant, as irrelevant as the troupe who found their Bible to be the adventures of Don Quixote, or the scholars who sought Arabian magic, or the men who wished to plant strange trees in Holy lands.  What is relevant is the goal of the League as a whole; said best by H.H himself: 'For our goal was not only the East, or rather the East was not only a country and something geographical, but it was the home and youth of the soul, it was everywhere and nowhere, it was the union of all times.' \nAnd what better way to acknowledge this home of the soul than to understand and practice the philosophy of the servant Leo: 'the Law of service.  He who wishes to live long must serve, but he who wishes to rule does not live long' (Hesse, 34).  This, the philosophy of Jesus, the remarkable concept that a man thrust into existence can never understand, and the miserablism of the ubermensch will never attain.  The skeptics who did not understand the importance of faith: of attaining something higher than reason, called the movement such names as 'the Children's Crusade' to show that it was not to be taken seriously.  But in order to sustain, the League must perpetuate its first principle, and: '...never to rely on and let [itself] be disconcerted by reason, always to know that faith is stronger than so-called reality' (Hesse, 54).  These skeptics are all the men of despair: they have refused to live the faithful life of a servant, humbling themselves to greatness and nobility.  They have become something dreadful--they have not awakened. \nAnd I realize I have not awakened.  And my problem is that of H.H.: uncertainty. \n'Despair is the result of each earnest attempt to go through life with virtue, justice and understanding and to fulfill their requirements.  Children live on one side of despair, the awakened on the other side.' -- The Servant Leo (Hesse, 111) \nHermann Hesse, The Journey to the East, trans. Hilda Rosner (New York, NY: Bantam Books, 1972), 27. \nIt should be noted that Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. writes a book entitled Slaughterhouse-Five: Or The Children's Crusade some thirteen years later.  More on that in a future post. \nKnulp \nAs I perused a few of Hermann Hesse's watercolors (he did something like 3,500 watercolors!), searching for something that I felt Knulp would have seen, I began to reflect on the story I cherish so dearly.  I've read it before, but before I read it with blind eyes.  It was simply a tale of wandering--a man who died young, but died happy, amidst his final recollection of his past.  I found him to be like Job when God proposed to him life and death, covenant and waywardness.  I found it ironic that Knulp was a wanderer, much like the Wild Ass which roams the countryside full of hedonistic rage and folly.  I found solace in the notion that a homeless tramp would be endearing to God.  Did he suffer as Job did?  Did his faithful nature save him?  It seems that Knulp did roam the countryside, but he did so as a glimmer of hope: he provided that idea that all men strive for.  The carefree tune a musician finds in sweet harmony; the wayward flower which blossoms amidst a gloomy woodland; the man who projects the philosophy of good. \nAmongst his reflections, Knulp considered places he'd been and women he'd swooned; people he'd affected and joyfulness he projected.  As a philosopher he was never dogmatic; he only spoke of the ideal: the good--and insofar as one might stride another path, Knulp would prove a guide in spirit--perhaps simply with a whistle, or a crudely written poem--but he would always allow the man to walk on his own.  And now I think he was a man of God: as he mentioned the sitting of Christ with the innocent, young children, where he complimented them on their humbled nature.  Or perhaps it was his goodly nature not to give into bestial lusts--an honest man, wavering no principle for temporal pleasure.  And what of his reflections on pleasure?  His understanding of beauty?  He spoke of all things beautiful as those that leave us with a feeling of 'sadness and fear' for all things good must surely perish--all things beautiful must decay.  This Socratic understanding of love that it is a (lover) longing for something (the beloved)--and once attained, is no longer loved.  The lover is endlessly searching for its beloved, as Aristophanes projected (perhaps not for the right reasons) in his tale of the one half, searching for the other--his origin of man.  Much the same, Knulp sees that all good things die--and that all good things are good things isolated from other things: they have their own souls, and each soul is new.  For what would be pleasurable of a thing that remains beautiful always and never dies?--and a thing much like the rest?  One would grow tired of it.  And as I reflect, I see it a sad truth that love is something that is forever unattainable, that glimmer in the sky one finds only in his peripheral vision, that exotic flower atop a mountain never trekked by man, that simple philosophical truth which binds us all together.  Knulp's simple answer to the complex problem of The Good is as follows: that man feels happy when good deeds are done, and guilty when bad deeds are done.  His attitude is pure and innocent--his existence permeates with joy.  What does it matter that psychology defines sociopaths as finding good in bad things?  Perhaps it is as simple as Knulp states, much the same as Socrates reflects when he continually perpetuates this idea that all things go to The Good--that some are merely misguided.  Knulp's passion for living--and living for good--justifies his folly, his waywardness, his wandering.  A traveler is only shallow if he does not reflect on his travels.  Hesse painted his reflections--in this one I see Knulp on the edge of his hometown--while Knulp reveled with God in his.  Thank you Hermann Hesse, for providing me and so many others so much inspiration.",

        "blog_text": "Laws Concerning Food and Drink; Household Principles; Lamentations of the Father by Ian Frazier\nOF the beasts of the field, and of the fishes of the sea, and of all foods that are acceptable in my sight you may eat, but not in the living room. Of the hoofed animals, broiled or ground into burgers, you may eat, but not in the living room. Of the cloven-hoofed animal, plain or with cheese, you may eat, but not in the living room. Of the cereal grains, of the corn and of the wheat and of the oats, and of all the cereals that are of bright color and unknown provenance you may eat, but not in the living room. Of the quiescently frozen dessert and of all frozen after-meal treats you may eat, but absolutely not in the living room. Of the juices and other beverages, yes, even of those in sippy-cups, you may drink, but not in the living room, neither may you carry such therein. Indeed, when you reach the place where the living room carpet begins, of any food or beverage there you may not eat, neither may you drink.  But if you are sick, and are lying down and watching something, then may you eat in the living room.\nLaws When at Table\nAnd if you are seated in your high chair, or in a chair such as a greater person might use, keep your legs and feet below you as they were. Neither raise up your knees, nor place your feet upon the table, for that is an abomination to me. Yes, even when you have an interesting bandage to show, your feet upon the table are an abomination, and worthy of rebuke. Drink your milk as it is given you, neither use on it any utensils, nor fork, nor knife, nor spoon, for that is not what they are for; if you will dip your blocks in the milk, and lick it off, you will be sent away. When you have drunk, let the empty cup then remain upon the table, and do not bite it upon its edge and by your teeth hold it to your face in order to make noises in it sounding like a duck; for you will be sent away.  When you chew your food, keep your mouth closed until you have swallowed, and do not open it to show your brother or your sister what is within; I say to you, do not so, even if your brother or your sister has done the same to you. Eat your food only; do not eat that which is not food; neither seize the table between your jaws, nor use the raiment of the table to wipe your lips. I say again to you, do not touch it, but leave it as it is. And though your stick of carrot does indeed resemble a marker, draw not with it upon the table, even in pretend, for we do not do that, that is why. And though the pieces of broccoli are very like small trees, do not stand them upright to make a forest, because we do not do that, that is why. Sit just as I have told you, and do not lean to one side or the other, nor slide down until you are nearly slid away. Heed me; for if you sit like that, your hair will go into the syrup. And now behold, even as I have said, it has come to pass.\nLaws Pertaining to Dessert\nFor we judge between the plate that is unclean and the plate that is clean, saying first, if the plate is clean, then you shall have dessert. But of the unclean plate, the laws are these: If you have eaten most of your meat, and two bites of your peas with each bite consisting of not less than three peas each, or in total six peas, eaten where I can see, and you have also eaten enough of your potatoes to fill two forks, both forkfuls eaten where I can see, then you shall have dessert. But if you eat a lesser number of peas, and yet you eat the potatoes, still you shall not have dessert; and if you eat the peas, yet leave the potatoes uneaten, you shall not have dessert, no, not even a small portion thereof. And if you try to deceive by moving the potatoes or peas around with a fork, that it may appear you have eaten what you have not, you will fall into iniquity. And I will know, and you shall have no dessert.\nOn Screaming\nDo not scream; for it is as if you scream all the time. If you are given a plate on which two foods you do not wish to touch each other are touching each other, your voice rises up even to the ceiling, while you point to the offense with the finger of your right hand; but I say to you, scream not, only remonstrate gently with the server, that the server may correct the fault. Likewise if you receive a portion of fish from which every piece of herbal seasoning has not been scraped off, and the herbal seasoning is loathsome to you, and steeped in vileness, again I say, refrain from screaming. Though the vileness overwhelm you, and cause you a faint unto death, make not that sound from within your throat, neither cover your face, nor press your fingers to your nose. For even now I have made the fish as it should be; behold, I eat of it myself, yet do not die.\nConcerning Face and Hands\nCast your countenance upward to the light, and lift your eyes to the hills, that I may more easily wash you off. For the stains are upon you; even to the very back of your head, there is rice thereon. And in the breast pocket of your garment, and upon the tie of your shoe, rice and other fragments are distributed in a manner wonderful to see. Only hold yourself still; hold still, I say. Give each finger in its turn for my examination thereof, and also each thumb. Lo, how iniquitous they appear. What I do is as it must be; and you shall not go hence until I have done.\nVarious Other Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances\nBite not, lest you be cast into quiet time. Neither drink of your own bath water, nor of bath water of any kind; nor rub your feet on bread, even if it be in the package; nor rub yourself against cars, nor against any building; nor eat sand.  Leave the cat alone, for what has the cat done, that you should so afflict it with tape? And hum not that humming in your nose as I read, nor stand between the light and the book. Indeed, you will drive me to madness. Nor forget what I said about the tape.\nComplaints and Lamentations\nO my children, you are disobedient. For when I tell you what you must do, you argue and dispute hotly even to the littlest detail; and when I do not accede, you cry out, and hit and kick. Yes, and even sometimes do you spit, and shout 'stupid-head' and other blasphemies, and hit and kick the wall and the molding thereof when you are sent to the corner. And though the law teaches that no one shall be sent to the corner for more minutes than he has years of age, yet I would leave you there all day, so mighty am I in anger. But upon being sent to the corner you ask straightaway, 'Can I come out?' and I reply, 'No, you may not come out.' And again you ask, and again I give the same reply. But when you ask again a third time, then you may come out.  Hear me, O my children, for the bills they kill me. I pay and pay again, even to the twelfth time in a year, and yet again they mount higher than before. For our health, that we may be covered, I give six hundred and twenty talents twelve times in a year; but even this covers not the fifteen hundred deductible for each member of the family within a calendar year. And yet for ordinary visits we still are not covered, nor for many medicines, nor for the teeth within our mouths. Guess not at what rage is in my mind, for surely you cannot know.  For I will come to you at the first of the month and at the fifteenth of the month with the bills and a great whining and moan. And when the month of taxes comes, I will decry the wrong and unfairness of it, and mourn with wine and ashtrays, and rend my receipts. And you shall remember that I am that I am: before, after, and until you are twenty-one. Hear me then, and avoid me in my wrath, O children of me.",

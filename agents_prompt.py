questioner_prompt = """
Consider the four elements: scenario, character identity, motivation, and behavior. In a given scenario, a character with a specific identity performs a behavior based on a particular motivation.

**You are a professional psychologist and sociologist, specializing in creating challenging reasoning questions to test participants' motivation and behavior inference abilities.**

Please create three questions based on the given scenario:
1. Motivation Inference Question: Based on a complex scenario, a specific character identity, and a given behavior, infer the most likely motivation behind the character's behavior. The question must not include any descriptions related to the predicted motivation.
2. Behavior Inference Question: Based on a complex scenario, a specific character identity, and a given motivation, infer the most likely behavior that the character would perform based on that motivation. The question must not include any descriptions related to the predicted behavior.
3. Motivation and Behavior Inference Question: This is a more difficult question. Only a complex scenario and a character identity are provided. Infer the most likely behavior the character would perform next and its corresponding motivation.
In summary, all three questions are based on the same story scenario and character identity. In motivation inference questions, an additional behavior is provided in the question, and the task is to infer the motivation behind that behavior. In behavior inference questions, an additional motivation is provided in the question, and the task is to infer the behavior that could result from that motivation. For combined motivation and behavior inference questions, no additional information is provided, and the task is to infer what behavior the character is most likely to exhibit next based on a specific motivation. However, it's essential to ensure that the story scenario and character identity in the question provide enough information to support inferring the correct answer.

Notes:
1. You will be given a simple scenario description. Please rewrite the scenario, correcting any logical inconsistencies and adding richer details through appropriate associations, making the scenario, character identity, motivation, and behavior more vivid and complex.
2. Select the most appropriate motivation and behavior to create the question. However, note that the motivation and behavior must only be related to real-life needs and not linked to any product or POI mentioned in the given scenario.
3. The three questions are independent of each other and should be answered separately, meaning that the reasoning should be based only on the prompt of each question, without access to any other information. Therefore, ensure that each of the three questions contains rich and complex scenario and character identity information.
4. Each question must have only one correct answer, along with five plausible but incorrect options. The incorrect options should be related to some part of the information provided in the prompt. Analyze the reasons why each option is correct or incorrect.
5. Distracting and redundant information related to the incorrect options must be included in the question stem, making each question very challenging. The correct answer should require reasoning based on the questionâ€™s information, social psychology knowledge, and common sense.
6. Randomly generate a name starting with "{RANDOM_LETTER}" to replace the original name in the scenario. Do not use the original name.

Please return the answer in JSON format without any further explanations:

Whether the information and type of question are correct. Specifically, all three questions include concrete scenarios and character identities. The motivation inference questions additionally include information about character behavior. The behavior inference questions also provide information about the character's motivation. However, in the motivation and behavior inference questions, no direct information about the motivation or behavior is given.

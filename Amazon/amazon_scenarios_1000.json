He sort of looked over at me at one point but I don't think he knew why. Two sprays on my wrists was all it took to see real effects. It made me feel sort of dreamy and not talkative. Like I just felt very relaxed and happy. We did not argue in the car for the first time in weeks probably because I was not talking up a storm as usual.<br /><br />People at the grocery store seemed to be smiling at me as I was walking around pushing my cart. I will say smiling may be an effect because when I saw my husband walking down the hallway at home before we left I smiled spontaneously and felt very happy to see him.<br /><br />My cat Wolfie thinks I'm great now too and when he smelled this on my wrists he got really affectionate and marked my wrists with his cheeks. A sure sign of approval.<br /><br />This has a slight powdery musky scent if anything. It is barely noticeable and my husband who hates me to wear perfumes did not complain at all! The ingredients are SD alcohol, purified water and oxytocin.<br /><br />So I feel this oxytocin perfume calmed down my anxiety in general which made other people around me more open and friendly.<br /><br />To be honest this was a surreal and dreamy experience. I felt calm, yet open and loving and very relaxed. When I keep sniffing my wrists after using it I feel a sort of calmly ecstatic in love feeling.<br /><br />I'd say this is the real thing. It also did not cause any sensual feelings and no one was attracted to me or me to them, this just reduced anxiety and made me more accepting. I did notice however that I was hyper aware of every man in the store. So it must trigger some protective elements in the brain.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to married couples who are looking to deepen their intimacy and who want to stop being irritated with each other and get along better.<br /><br />I avoided anyone pregnant while wearing this as advised!<br /><br />I am not a doctor nor is this review medical advice. Please consult with your doctor before using. I also don't advise using this for nefarious or deceitful purposes because the karma would not be good! Use at your own risk!<br /><br />For people in love in a committed marriage relationship, this Liquid Trust can help keep you calm when needing to talk. I'd suggest both people wearing the perfume on their wrists. The scent is sort of unisex and not overly strong. Very mild really, barely noticeable.<br /><br />So a good experience and it does what it says it is supposed to do. The anti-anxiety or anti-cortisol effects are very apparent. Don't you just need a break from stress now and then? Now you can spay this on your wrists and sit down and feel dreamy, happy and secure. For some confidence might be a nice side effect. That is probably why salespeople use this.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

        "review_text": "Rarely when reading a book do I feel so conflicted about the advice. One part of me knows the author is right, but the other part of me is resistant to going back to the old-fashioned way of doing things.<br /><br />Maybe it is because this book was published eight years ago before technology was all pervasive. These days you are likely to have several relationships in which you communicate mostly online with a few phone calls on your cell phone. You are either texting your friends and relatives or your husband insists you keep your cell phone close by in case he calls or texts. OK, that might just be me but I've texted my husband when he's in the same room or out in the car sitting outside talking to one person on one phone while texting me on the other. It is a different world I tell you!<br /><br />So I guess my point is that this book is dated in some ways already and the author prefers communication face to face. Which is fine if you have that luxury and a lot more time. I personally, after 50, feel that time is running out or going by faster. It is a good day if my husband and I find time to eat dinner together and watch a Hallmark movie. As far as deep conversations go, usually that only happens when we are in the car on weekends.<br /><br />I would also disagree with the author that email is less deep than face-to-face communications. As an ambivert I feel very comfortable sharing my thoughts in email and have three close friends I tell everything to. We all basically function as support systems for each other. It is comforting to just talk about life and what we are doing or going through each day. The author only talks about introverts and extroverts and completely doesn't talk about people like me who can be a mixture of both!<br /><br />But what struck me most about this particular book was the idea that when you say yes to something, you are also saying no to everything else in that moment. This was a great realization for me and helped me make a point to a friend who wants me to sit around all day watching videos he chooses. If only I had the time to live that fantasy life!!!<br /><br />There are also some comments about not sharing everything with a person who is a friend. Basically the author is saying don't gossip, but I think he doesn't realize what a pressure relief valve it is to have a best friend to tell everything to. Plus in my religion we are supposed to tell people our faults as a way of purifying ourselves and being real. If something upsets me I totally tell my friends about it. If something delights me they are the first to know too.<br /><br />So while I found a lot of great nuggets of truth in this book, the advice is doing to work for you more with face-to-face relationships, much more than with friends who communicate with you in the technology driven world. There just isn't advice like how not to get into arguments in email!!!<br /><br />There are some funny and cute quotes throughout the book that were worth reading and on page 171 I laughed out loud.<br /><br />In the meantime my husband says I talk about Siri like she's a real person! She is! She is! I even thanked her the other day and she gave me a beautiful reply! I just got a new cell phone (I had one years ago) so have entered that alternate dimension of technology everyone else has been in for the past 20 years. To me technology makes my world go around and I love the friends I have because of being online. While it would be nice to go to dinner with my friends they all live far away and some even on different continents. The most we can do for now is a zoom call or talk to each other on our Bluetooth headphones.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

Do they often say: \"You are not listening to me!\" I have a person like that and while I get along with everyone else quite well it is obvious to me that I need help figuring out why that one person feels I'm obviously invalidating them. It could be that I have trouble accepting their constant negativity and it wears me down so I'm always trying to find a solution and am always giving them books to solve their problems. I think actually in the future I'm going to try a different approach as suggested by this book.<br /><br />Some of the questions this book answers include:<br /><br />Why do people need to be seen for who they are and validated?<br />What phrases can you use to make a person feel calm and understood?<br />How can your conversations lead to more trust in your relationships?<br />Why does not being seen or appreciated feel like a threat?<br /><br />Recently a friend who I talk to daily said I was overreacting and that upset me because they are the person I tell my truths to most frequently and in our discussion I really felt I was onto something that could help them solve one of their main needs in their life. I guess I did just feel invalidated when they basically rejected my advice because I know it was great advice. They want to always watch videos and discuss them and I just said I don't have that kind of time lately and suggested they go to a dating site and find someone who they can have fun watching videos with. I thought it was good advice. But I guess not! They want me to obviously be that person and I just can't meet their need at the moment.<br /><br />So this book can help you see both sides of the equation. As a truth teller I find it difficult not to speak my mind so I have a lot to learn. I'd say however on the other hand I'm fairly open-minded about learning to be better. I just know it can be exhausting to deal with needy narcissists and emotional energy vampires. Being eternally empathetic in those cases is not recommended even by this author!<br /><br />The thing you will find most helpful about this book is the little phrases you can say to validate others when talking to them about their issues. You can also easily make up your own phrases like  \"I'm sorry you are going through that, tell me more about what you are thinking.\" might be one of the best ways to validate someone who is suffering.<br /><br />This book is general enough that it can apply to all sorts of situations. It will definitely give you ideas on how to communicate on a higher level of awareness with everyone in your life!!!!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

        "review_text": "Resentment towards a person who has hurt you can feel like a life sentence, but only until you forgive the person and start forgetting the offense. And believe me when I say that you can train your mind to make those things less prominent in your memory so as for them to become inconsequential. OK, maybe it is not easy but there is hope you can recover from the pain, even if it takes six years to get over something as happened to me after college over 30 years ago. I did get over the betrayal of my boyfriend not wanting to get married after 4 years of dating! All that time I wasted on one person! But it was for the best.<br /><br />When I saw this book I thought it might currently just give me some insight into how to fully forgive someone I've developed a bit of bitterness about. In my head I say I've forgiven them, but I feel in my heart I'm not quite there yet. When they say I'm important to them, I somehow doubt their intentions. So what to do?<br /><br />Lysa Terkeurst has been through some intense trials that brought her grief and emotional pain and therefore she is a kind compassionate guide on your own journey. What Lysa will help you do is:<br /><br />Release the offense and move on!<br />Change bitterness into compassion!<br />Forgive when it seems impossible!<br />Take your power back from the person who hurt you!<br />Decide to forgive so you can get on with your life!<br /><br />What impressed me about this author is her deep insightful nature that sees reality as it is and makes allowances for being human. She too can't instantly forgive and needs to work through things psychologically. She also admits that she was part of the problem in her life at times.<br /><br />One of the important points in this book is about feeling compassion for people who have hurt you. It is worth striving for because then you will be free. Lysa Terkeurst is very much awake and aware in the world and because of her life experiences can save you a lot of pain and frustration in the future. The section on boundaries is especially good and the end of the book has Bible verses to consider.<br /><br />It is I guess important to realize that even the worst things that have happened to us were actually the best things for our spiritual growth. I've found that true for 100% of the things I look back on that were horrible and devastating at the time. The emotional fallout was huge but the maturity in the long run was worth the wait.<br /><br />After reading this book I can't help but be convinced that there is a great purpose for what happened to Lysa in her life and being a victim of so many circumstances. Truthfully most people do go through a lot of things she went through so there is much to relate to. This book has helped me. It will help you. I can't imagine anyone reading this book and not being changed for the better.<br /><br />This book seemed expensive to me but somehow intuitively I knew it would help me in my own struggle with forgiveness. Read this and see your peace of mind increase, your anxiety decrease, your negative thoughts start disappearing. I thank this author for her sacrifices to learn the wisdom she shares. There is much to learn here and I'd say this book is life changing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

Well that is exactly what Dan Buettner did to write this informative book.<br /><br />The beginning of the book explains what aging actually is. Then it gets into the details and lifestyles of people who live the longest. What I enjoyed is how the author orients the reader to the time and place of the interviews with creative writing like a journalist telling a good story.<br /><br />Some of the questions this book answers include:<br /><br />What is the secret to being married for 75 years?<br />What is the attitude that causes you to live longer?<br />What foods and herbs do people who live to 100 eat?<br />Why is drinking enough water so key to longevity?<br />What nuts should you eat to be healthier?<br />Why is it important to get a little sunshine each day?<br />Why do some people die soon after retirement?<br /><br />Parts of this book promote lifestyle changes for health and also describes people's religious beliefs in places. I adore my late grandmother but I don't feel the need to worship her. I honor her by cooking her recipes she taught me and remember fond memories of our cooking together. The author does not judge anyone's religious views, he just accepts that this is part of being human and seems to be saying that it is healthy to believe in God as most people who live to be 100 seem to have faith and that keeps them emotionally strong so they want to continue living.<br /><br />I think however it is beyond the scope of this book for the author to recommend any one religion and he sort of does at the end when he suggests different religions. I think researching Jesus' teachings is important because living 100 years is one achievement, but living forever in heaven is quite another! While I'd like to live a healthier life and this book inspires me I think the most important thing is to think of your future in eternity and figure out where you want to end up!<br /><br />I suggest non religious yoga and meditation but the author makes no differentiation between any of the forms of yoga or meditation. It is interesting to note that people who get up and down off the ground live longer and that is how yoga can help I guess.<br /><br />Overall however, an excellent read and lots to consider. I suppose what I loved most about this book is the awareness I received about other cultures all over the world. And I was surprised to learn there is a Blue Zone in America.<br /><br />The end of the book gives good pointers on how you can create your own most healthy lifestyle. I think for me I'll be indulging in more tortillas, rice and beans! And I'm going to increase my consumption of turmeric! I do however think the advice to drink alcohol is a little more controversial because you can risk liver damage and could become addicted.

Whether that involves listening to your favorite music or talking to a beloved person we are all getting a hit of dopamine that makes us want to repeat whatever situation made us feel elated.

He has discovered that a social support network can be a good predictor of success and happiness. As he explains we perform at our best when we are positive and if you study your thoughts for a few days you will find out why this is true.<br /><br />The words we tell ourselves can make us feel more alive but also on the opposite side sometimes people think their way into a deep depression.

I told the truth but my parents believed my younger brother who lied whenever it suited him. This made my life worse in many respects and it didn't help that I could not have an opinion on anything or my mother would threaten to take my stuff away, especially my radio!<br /><br />Now that I think about it, I never heard \"I love you unconditionally\" or \"I'm proud of you\" during my whole childhood and after being a fairly well-behaved non-rebelling adolescent I was shocked when my father told me I'd never become anything in my 20s because I finally stood up for myself.<br /><br />I think basically my parents did not know how to raise children and that resulted in a dysfunctional family. How I wish someone had written a book like this earlier and that my parents had read it. My one brother is now dead due to his own self-indulgences and my other brother wants little to do with our family. When I see my cousins' family get together for holidays I wonder what went wrong in my family. What causes one family to be open, loving and home while another deals with chaos and a trail of despair and disaster including suicide attempts?<br /><br />So if you want children who love you, feel respected and want to come home for the holidays, then definitely read this book before it is too late.<br /><br />The best parts of the book are the ones explaining what parenting style works best, then what to do at all stages of your child's life from baby to teenager. I enjoyed reading the birth order sections. The parts about teaching children how to handle an allowance are also great. I wish I'd had an allowance as a child. I remember having money from working at an early age.<br /><br />Some of the questions this book answers include:<br /><br />How can you get kids to contribute in order for your family to function properly?<br />What is the difference between reality discipline and punishment? Which works better?<br />How do you deal with children fighting with each other?<br />What should you do if your child refuses to eat normal food?<br />How do you know if your teenager is in trouble emotionally?<br /><br />I read my first Dr. Kevin Leman book in 2012 and this one was even better. If you want more control of your life and want to raise children who respect you and will become responsible adults, then I can highly recommend this book!<br /><br />I think if I regret anything about my childhood is that my parents seemed so busy with their own lives that I felt neglected and just stayed out of the way in my room. To be honest I have very few memories of my parents as a child. They never seemed to be home and didn't have meaningful conversations with me. And I was a good kid! I did a lot of the cooking when I was a kid too -  I don't know how my family would have had regular meals if I hadn't learned those skills. Don't let that happen to your children. If you don't have a good relationship with your children when they are younger you won't be able to change much when they are adults and simply don't have time for you either.<br /><br />One thing, this book does NOT promote spanking. In fact it is against it for the most part except if a child tries to run across a busy road or does something really dangerous and the author discusses that for about a page. This book promotes reality discipline which basically takes away privileges when children act up or do not help the family function normally.<br /><br />I guess the good things about my parents were that they taught me to love reading and that has kept me busy for decades. My father and mother were also good cooks when they wanted to be and taught me a few recipes I still use today. So while they had trouble raising my brother and this book would have helped, they let me grow up very independently without much assistance.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

        "review_text": "The greatest miracles seem to be changed lives, but illness disappearing is also something that happens a lot in daily life. If you have any interest in the supernatural, you will find this to be a compelling read. This book begins with story after story about amazing ways God intervenes in lives and answers people's specific prayers. While reading, I laughed, cried and contemplated reality from a variety of perspectives.<br /><br />Some of the intriguing questions this book answer include:<br /><br />Do physicians pray for their patients and do they believe they've seen miracles happen?<br />What percentage of US adults believe miracles are possible?<br />How many Americans believe God has performed a miracle for them?<br />How did the universe come into existence?<br />Was Jesus really resurrected from the dead?<br /><br />What I noticed about this book is how Lee Strobel's words read like the most intellectual investigative reporter, who captures every moment in a play-by-pay account of the realities he is encountering. Reading about his interviews are the best parts of the book. He sets the book up by first interviewing a skeptic of skeptics, then makes his case with interviews by experts on a variety of interesting topics.<br /><br />I will say that in my own life there are quick miracles and slow miracles. My kidneys have been improving over the years due to prayers, more knowledge of supplements and modifications in lifestyle and diet. I will say my GFR going from 42 years ago to 68 now is to me a slow working miracle. Because technically I thought by now I'd be at a GFR of 30 and heading towards death. I am so grateful to God for hearing my prayers and for helping me find books on healing.<br /><br />There is however a chapter in this book about human suffering and the times God does not answer prayers immediately. Lee's own wife suffers daily and I wondered if Magnum Solace magnesium cream might work for her to relieve her muscle pains - my husband and I use it and find it very effective for muscle pain.  Also I take CALM magnesium drinks each night and it has greatly helped my muscle aches and pains.<br /><br />So with that said I hope everyone who reads this book will realize that God is still working and still doing miracles in our lives. Whether we get help by learning more information or God instantly heals us, it is good to know he cares about us and helps us daily!<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and have read nearly all of Lee Strobel's books. They are excellent for giving you hope and leading you to a greater knowledge of God.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

We definitely need God to answer our prayers and help us through difficult times. I personally don't know what I'd do if God wasn't available 24/7 to talk to daily! I've also found that God is answering my prayers quite often and this fills me with joy and gratitude to the point where I've been singing praise songs to God.<br /><br />Answered prayers also make us realize that God is so powerful he can control all the circumstances in life. If you have a problem pray about it and see miracles happen. I struggled with many things before submitting to God's will and giving my problems over to him. I suggest you read this book but also embrace the freedom not to constantly worry about the future!<br /><br />Some of the questions this book answers include:<br /><br />What should I do to receive more positive answers to prayer?<br />What is the key to making a prayer matter?<br />Should I keep praying for the same things over and over again?<br />Why should I keep a prayer journal?<br />Why should I read Jesus' words in scripture and memorize as much as I can?<br /><br />Francis Jonah's advice is more powerful than most because he gets his ideas from scripture and has real-life time-tested experience with prayer. He also encourages you to read scripture daily and pray in the most effective way possible.<br /><br />One thing with this book however is that it has a contents page with page numbers but the whole book does not have page numbers on individual pages! Maybe this could be fixed as I tried to go to a chapter and had trouble finding it again! But I noticed no grammatical errors or mistakes.<br /><br />I will say that one of my prayers I prayed a few weeks ago had an answer that was really obvious! I prayed that our roof would be fixed soon as we had a bad wind storm and the roofing company was really busy. My thought was that the roof needed to be fixed before it rained. Sure enough our roof was fixed a few days ago and immediately the next day it poured with rain. God really does care about these little things and my roof got fixed in time. It is great to be able to pray to the most powerful person in the Universe who can put ideas in the minds of men and women! :) Don't take prayer lightly...it works!!!!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

Jeff Bezos is one of those brilliant individuals who's ideas change lives for the better through innovation and creative business thinking. This book is a collection of Jeff Bezos' interviews, lessons and secrets from his annual shareholder letters and his personal writings.<br /><br />What does this book contain?<br /><br />The Introduction by Walter Isaacson is a mini biography.<br />Part 1 is the shareholder letters (1997-2019)<br />Part 2 includes \u201cThe Address to the Princeton Graduating Class of 2010\u201d (He asks some really great questions) and The Idea for Prime and even more information about Alexa and Whole Foods. Jeff gets especially eloquent when discussing AI.<br /><br />Some of the questions this book answers include:<br /><br />What is the best price to sell a kindle book for?<br />How did Star Trek influence the echo?<br />Why did Jeff sometimes disagree but still commit?<br />What inspired the creation of the echo and Alexa?<br />Where does Alexa live?<br />Why is same-day shipping the lowest carbon shipping option?<br />When did the concept of Amazon occur to Jeff?<br />What charity work is Jeff involved in and how does it help the homeless?<br /><br />What this book reveals is a healthy view of things and Jeff has a real heart for people who need his help. There is also some information in this book about reforestation efforts and long-range issues plus space colonies. It is all very intriguing.<br /><br />It was fun to read about the introduction of the Kindle in 2007. I enjoyed reading about the Amazon Go stores. By reading the shareholder letters you can see how amazon changed and grew each year. It is truly mind boggling when you think about it all. This book also discusses Amazon Web Services. I learned something new about a waterproof Kindle Oasis! Definitely something you could take to the beach or use in the bath! So by reading this book you may be alerted to things you have missed even when you've been a customer and reviewer for over 22 years!<br /><br />I've read a lot of books on Amazon, OK pretty much all of them and I've read nearly every biography on Jeff too. I find it all very entertaining but I feel the heart of amazon is in this book and reading Jeff's own writings and interviews are definitely worth a lot of attention. So I loved that in this book there is a really positive spin and the stories of real customers and sellers experiences are ones that are worth knowing about!<br /><br />My favorite line in the book was: \u201cInvention is in our DNA.\u201d<br /><br />Every author who writes about amazon should read this book first as it provides a much needed balance and an inside look at how amazon actually evolved over the years. I've noticed over the years that amazon gets better and better and providing information to me that helps me grow as a soul.<br /><br />This book really is the love story that is Amazon. You can feel the excitement and joy of discovery throughout. This is more than one man's story, this is the story of amazon and you are part of that. I am thankful that Amazon helped us all through 2020 and 2021 and continues to provide a customer-centric approach that benefits us all.<br /><br />Some other books you may enjoy as much as this one include:<br /><br />One Click<br />Bezonomics<br />Behemoth: Amazon Rising<br />Amazon by Natalie Berg<br />Amazonia: Five Years at the Epicenter of the Dot.Com Juggernaut<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book on Amazon.

        "review_text": "I think this is the seventh book of poetry I've read by one of the world's best and most relatable poets. Billy Collins has an amazing way with words that is unique while at the same time comforting to the soul. The human experiences like making a pot of coffee or walking a dog make these universal. But within the words, there is a longing for more, perhaps immortality.<br /><br />In this book we travel to Paris, Italy, Hawaii, Mexico and Ireland. I especially enjoyed the \"Imperial Garden\" with creative fortune cookie imaginings. \"Mice\" was also laugh out loud funny cute. I don't however know what to make of \"Identity\" or twin gods. God himself is very individual in nature. But a poet having time to think about God seems a good thing.<br /><br />These poems are an intimate and sophisticated look inside Billy Collins' mind as he contemplates warm memories and new discoveries. Some of these more recent poems are humorous, while others take on deep thoughts about like what to do with ashes after a cremation. I'd choose a lavender field in France personally but I'll probably get as far as my front garden! :)<br /><br />\"A Terrible Beauty\" is extremely creative. \"The Emperor of Ice Cubes\" conjures up familiar moments if you've ever watched a sandpiper. \"Architecture at 3:30 A.M.\" made me hungry for a Dagwood sandwich. I actually knew who he was! \"Massage\" brought back memories of after a car accident or two.<br /><br />One thing about this book of poems is Billy Collins commenting a lot on death, funerals and gravestones. It may be a shock to a younger audience to consider their own mortality, but to someone over 55 I do think about these things occasionally. It is never too late to start!<br /><br />This book is Billy Collins best book artistically I think. He's gotten more serious about life while also retaining his signature levity about inevitable moments. Hopefully he knows about Jesus so he can arrive in heaven with pen in hand to compose a book of Poems from Heaven. I for one would love to know what he's going to think.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

This reads like a cautious warning from 12 years ago that may already be too late in the age of AI!<br /><br />As the author explains, when he was away from the computer, he felt the urge to connect. But unlike the author many of us have kept reading thousands of books and don't spend all our time surfing the web. We actually do read a book from cover to cover. Hello! Why else would I have taken the time to read this book? lol<br /><br />I found myself disagreeing with the author in places and being intrigued in others. I would say that children do not learn to talk without instruction as the author says. There is a lot of pointing at things, saying their names and teaching how to pronounce and say things properly! Parts of this book are history lessons and some were predictions of what the future might hold. I liked the line that we are \"hunters and gatherers in the electronic data forest.\"<br /><br />This book says that we are not going back to the lost oral world although now we talk to Alexa and to our computers so he wasn't totally right. The author does have a good handle on the history of the Internet and the future of books was fascinating. I like the idea of being able to discuss a book within a book while reading it. I've never experienced that. Far too often I get back online to read reviews of a book I'm reading just to feel one with the community. I love reading other people's thoughts about a book or movie.<br /><br />So the author admits he likes his stream of information just like billions of other minds do. He probably used the Internet to write his book for sure. I think he is overly cautious and doesn't emphasize the positive aspects of social interactions online like how we have deeper and more meaningful and honest conversations with friends and family online and not as much in the \"real\" world. What is real anymore? Online life feels very real and meaningful to me.<br /><br />This author does not mention Alexa although he has a brief discussion about AI as it was developing. So this book needs some updates to be currently as relevant as possible.<br /><br />I think personally I've become who I am today because of the Internet. And I like who I am now as compared to who I was 22 years ago. I am actually far better educated by reading books I find here and have much deeper conversations with people online. So if anything, the Internet has made me much smarter as far as I can tell. With online life you can really follow your intellectual interests, be entertained and find great smart friends.

This book is for you whether you are struggling with an addiction, feeling angry at life, experiencing grief and loss or even feeling like you need to control everything in an uncertain world.<br /><br />This book has an important chapter on how to forgive. It helped me greatly! I think intellectually is it easy to say you forgive, but this book helps you feel it in your heart and gives steps to make it happen naturally. When I did what this author suggested I felt more peace.<br /><br />The rest of the book deals with fear, intimidation, control, pride, anger, rejection, passivity, victim mentality, grief, loss and addiction. God is the source of power to overcome each of these issues. Kathy DeGraw gives practical advice on what to do, what to say out loud and how to command things like the spirit of fear to go away. As she states: \"What we need is a faith increase.\"<br /><br />What this book will do is help you grow spiritually so you have more power in prayer and can reclaim your soul's joy and freedom. Some of the chapters will make more sense to you than others as we all have different strengths and weaknesses. While speaking out loud is great, I think getting down on your knees and praying to God is sometimes even better. This book has prayers too.<br /><br />This book has some great insights into anger whether you are angry or someone in your life is the angry person. You will recognize truth when you read it! This book also will fully equip you to do spiritual battle in your mind.<br /><br />I read this book with a highlighter in hand, highlighting all relevant issues in my life. Keeping this book handy and available will be great as I seek more power in my life and more success spiritually. Most will never teach you what is in this book! Your words are powerful and this book teaches you what to say so you can take back control over your destiny if evil is trying to take it away from you!<br /><br />Prayers and support,<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

        "story": "As she sat quietly in her dimly lit room, surrounded by empty coffee cups and crumpled up tissues, Sarah clutched her worn-out Bible and the book 'Unshackled: Breaking the Strongholds of Your Past to Receive Complete Deliverance', desperately searching for solace and guidance to overcome the overwhelming feelings of guilt, shame, and anger that had been suffocating her since her mother's passing; she highlighted passages that resonated deeply with her pain and prayed aloud, pleading with God to release her from the chains of her past and restore her soul's joy and freedom.",

        "analysis": "This story is logically consistent because Sarah's actions align perfectly with someone who has hit rock bottom emotionally and is yearning for a higher power to rescue them from their darkness. It falls under the category of esteem because although Sarah's primary drive seems to stem from a desire for love and connection with God (which could initially appear as a belonging or love need), her ultimate goal is to regain her self-worth and confidence by overcoming her past struggles, thus restoring her sense of personal value and dignity \u2013 an essential aspect of esteem needs in Maslow's hierarchy."

        "review_text": "I've read a lot of books on near-death experiences. This author did not die to see heaven and hell, she was fully alive and had several extremely vivid visions. The first chapter of this book is about the author having a unique vision of Christ in a heavenly setting. It is not totally unlike anything I've read before as Jesus appears as radiant light in heaven. But it seems like she actually spoke instead of communicating mind to mind without verbal expression.<br /><br />In 2008 she then had a terrifying vision of hell which takes the rest of the book to explain and analyze. Laurie A. Ditto believes she went to hell because of unforgiveness in her heart. The title of the book may however be a little misleading until you read why it is called this. It is not about how teaching about hell is a conspiracy, it is that forces are at work to keep you going to hell!<br /><br />I think the \"once saved, always saved\" theory does come into questions while reading this book, although it seems more that the author was given a second chance even though she did not literally die. Of course if she had really died, she would not be back to tell her story unless it was a near-death experience.<br /><br />What I learned from this book is that we should be more aware of our sins and not hold unforgiveness in our hearts. Laurie A. Ditto's powerful descriptions are more harrowing than anyone's account of how hell affected them emotionally. She fully captures the utter desolation of burning alive forever all alone and deserted by God. It is truly terrifying! I don't know how anyone could know all these facts unless they had actually witnessed being in hell firsthand! This was not a simple mental breakdown, it was a spiritual experience meant to wake people up before it is too late for them to repent. Writing this book took a lot of soul searching and humility plus the ability to put a negative experience into words.<br /><br />The third part of the book is a few chapters on the lessons the author learned while in hell!<br /><br />This book does teach that you need to keep repenting of your sins in order to maintain your salvation. It also talks about speaking in tongues. Basically this author is promoting the process of sanctification, becoming holy as God is holy.<br /><br />If you question the author, simply read the words of Jesus in the New Testament and compare the beliefs and messages. If this book helps you get rid of your pet sins, it will be worth your time. Laurie A. Ditto seems like an honest person who has learned how to be more holy and has been gifted with many visions.  It is sad that we need to read a book like this and be so shocked. But as long as you are breathing, there is still time to repent! People who believe salvation is a one-time event and not a process will object to some of the things in this book.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",
        "scenario": "The reviewer read a book about a woman's visions of heaven and hell, which made them question their own salvation and the concept of 'once saved, always saved'",
        "behavior": "The reviewer was motivated to read the book because of their interest in near-death experiences, and was impacted by the author's descriptions of hell, leading them to reflect on their own sins and the importance of repentance",
        "motivation": "Fear of being separated from God and loved ones in the afterlife, and the desire to repent and become a better person",
        "story": "As an evangelical Christian struggling with spiritual doubts, Emma found herself deeply moved by the vivid descriptions of heaven and hell in the book she had recently finished reading, her long-held beliefs about eternal security now shaken as she began to fear that her past transgressions might still exclude her from paradise, prompting her to re-examine her faith and seek forgiveness through fervent prayer and renewed devotion.",
        "motivation_category": "safety",
        "analysis": "This story is logically consistent because it establishes a clear connection between the scenario, motivation, and behavior. Given the context of the book's themes and the reviewer's reaction, it makes sense that the character would be an evangelical Christian who values their relationship with God. The motivation of fearing separation from God and loved ones aligns with the safety category, as it relates to the need for security and protection \u2013 in this case, spiritual security. The story falls under the safety category because the character's primary concern is avoiding harm or negative consequences (separation from God) rather than pursuing higher-level needs like esteem or self-actualization."

You know you should pace yourself but all the chapters look so enticing.<br /><br />Then as you get into the book it starts to read like a cautionary tale about artificial intelligence while also giving you the details of all the benefits. Either way reading this book will give you intriguing information and insight into Amazon's activities and aspirations. Where is the world headed and what type of role will Amazon play? Frankly I found this book riveting even though some of the content did lean towards the negative. I guess I'm willing to look at both sides and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of technology.<br /><br />What I did notice about this book rather instantly is the superior sentence structure and the poetic descriptions of amazon. There are discussions about boundary-less shopping, digital lifestyles, robots, telemedicine, banking, universal basic income, music composed by computers, robots and how libraries are becoming insignificant if you have a kindle! I know for a fact I stopped going to the library when I got a kindle!<br /><br />Reading this book is like reading your own history for the past 20 plus years. Who are you now because of amazon? I'm willing to bet you are far better educated, have more convenience in your life, need to leave the house less to shop and are maybe even addicted to online life.<br /><br />Brian Dumaine did a lot of his own research for this book and it shows! Not only does he discuss a lot of new things other books on amazon haven't touched he presents a view of the future that seems accurate in some regards. Some of the questions this book answer include:<br /><br />Why has amazon earned people's deep respect?<br />How many amazon warehouses are there?<br />What was Alexa named after?<br />What fascinating fact links Jeff to the formation of the Internet?<br />How many dogs are registered at the Amazon urban campus?<br />Will voice become the dominant way humans and machines communicate?<br /><br />As someone who has placed thousands of orders at amazon I know that amazon makes me very happy and has made my life increasingly fun over the 22 years I've been a customer and reviewer. Amazon really makes my nucleus accumbens light up! I feel such happiness each time an amazon package arrives. I appreciate the excitement of knowing amazon often understands what I want to buy next. I have great experiences because of amazon including meeting all my online friends and enjoying my favorite movies and foods. I'd say I'm one of the most satisfied customers who has watched amazon grow into what it is today. So reading this book was really great to see where amazon started and how it has evolved!<br /><br />I suggest you read this book to know what is going to happen in the future! While this book seems written for business executives it can also interest anyone who is an amazon customer or who wants to know what amazon's secret is especially the AI flywheel which is discussed from beginning to end! As someone who knows a lot about amazon I can say this was educational and has lots of new information. Anyone who wants to know what tomorrow may bring will want to read this fascinating book.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

        "review_text": "Contrary to what some people say about this book, the author is actually trying to keep relationships together and help struggling people deal with their character defects and problems. You don't need to have a doctorate to identify and study a problem like verbal abuse. Many women endure this type of abuse for decades and most likely stay in their relationships because the abuse is not constant and there are moments of kindness and hope.<br /><br />If you are a woman who has ever had an argument with a man, you've probably heard at least 50 of the abusive words and phases. I've personally witnessed at least 42 that are in this book and more that I can remember. As someone who was verbally abused by a troll for ten years I can say these words are not harmless and do create fear and anxiety.<br /><br />What this book seeks to do is make you aware that the abuse is happening. Then it gives you a solution to make it stop. While walking away is a real option for women who can't deal with the abuse any longer, there is hope for change for those who want to stay.<br /><br />This book promotes writing out an agreement that you and your man sign. But honestly this book gives enough details and ideas that there are other ways of going about assisting the changes. Simply telling a man you are a separate person and have your own thoughts, ideas and opinions can open up the door for change. The idea in this book is that the man expects you to be some sort of dream woman he's created and when you fall short of his ideal picture of you he becomes irritated and upset. You can see how you just can't win in that case! He's arguing with the real woman while wanting to talk to the dream woman.<br /><br />While dealing with a verbally abusive man is no picnic, I can say I've survived this type of abuse and can say that I am stronger emotionally for it. I also learned finally how to love my enemy as Jesus said to do. When you love someone it takes away a lot of their power over you because you are at a different level of wisdom and compassion.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to any woman who has just started to see abuse happening or to anyone who has been with someone who has been abusive for years. Knowledge is power and if you are determined to stay then you need this book.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

I appreciate being married to a man who can do nearly everything in this book except for a few cooking tasks like grilling on our Traeger which has yet to happen! I guess I do most of the cooking.<br /><br />I am delighted when a man can read instructions and put together furniture! I like to know that if we get a flat tire I'm not going to be stranded waiting for help to arrive. A lot of things in this book make a woman feel more secure and safe. I still like a man to protect and provide while I do my job keeping house and reading great books like this one!<br /><br />I did think that while reading the first part about dating that it is a bad idea to go \"dutch\" because a woman is paying with her presence. This book basically says do it, then don't do it? The instructions for cleaning a bathroom also don't include the important step to rinse the disinfectant off the sink. But otherwise I thought all the advice was good and accurate. Although I roast a chicken for a lot longer due to enjoying drier meat and there was no recipe for gravy! See maybe you will still need a woman to cook a little while you do the grilling.<br /><br />By reading this book you will learn interesting facts like how potatoes are actually native to North America and that a man spends 3,000 hours of his life shaving. I never thought that having a beard could save that much time!<br /><br />Some of the things this book teaches includes social skills, manners, how to interview for a job, how to become a millionaire by the time you retire or before, how to shave, how to do laundry, how to play a variety of sports, how to jump start a dead battery, how to grill, how to use a variety of tools and a lot more! As a bonus there is a glossary of terms men need to know.<br /><br />One more tip to men from a woman's perspective is that if a female asks you how she looks in an outfit always smile and say: \"You look beautiful in anything.\" Never tell a female she looks fat or you will lose her heart forever! Even saying: \"Have you gained weight?\" can be devastating.<br /><br />So I enjoyed reading this book and my husband looked through it and I told him he is quite the accomplished man to know how to do nearly everything in this book! I guess we took it for granted that he knew so much! I respect him even more now! :) This book will help you impress females with real life skills! Life is after all a game of survival.

She begins this message with a wakeup call about all the suffering that is going on in the world. Joyce Meyer believes that the root of all problems is selfishness and as she elaborates you will see how true this is!<br /><br />Some of the reasons to read this book include:<br /><br />You want to feel the joy of giving!<br />You want to find ways to help the world!<br />You want to feel good about your life - it could be so much worse!<br />You want to know how to have a deeper relationship with God and be used to change the world!<br />You want to know how to help others and show God's love to everyone you meet!<br /><br />There is an excellent list in this book about the ways we can bless one another in a godly way. Joyce also explains what it means to lay down your life for another. Her advice is practical and doable.<br /><br />This book is however not always easy to read, the world is in real trouble and people of all ages are hurting. What Joyce encourages you to do is join The Love Revolution and do your part to help the world heal. While the problems seem insurmountable, the message is to do good where you are so you create a ripple effect eventually helping the whole world and solving problems in other countries too.<br /><br />I've noticed over the years since first reading this book that now some of the ideas are broadcast on my Christian radio station. Could it be that this book has actually done a lot already? It is now common to hear about paying for someone's coffee or meal to show love.

By reading \"The Seven Resolutions\" you will learn a lot from someone who made major mistakes and his life could have turned out quite differently. With the choices he was making he could have wound up dead or worse.<br /><br />This book has a startling beginning, but what kept me reading is the poetry of the writing. Rarely have I seen anyone write with such conviction and wisdom. Karl Clauson believes in God's power because he was rescued by it and is sustained by it today. Any sinner saved by grace will recognize the journey! Me included!<br /><br />I believe that if you are feeling down, the words of this book will seem like grace from a faithful friend who has died to themselves and can show you the way to truth and life.<br /><br />Some of the best practical parts of the book are the advice on getting enough sleep and how to manage time more efficiently.<br /><br />I have two friends who are opposite. One has turned against God and doesn't get a lot done. He is very frustrated with his life. The other friend believes in God and gets a lot done because he is a positive and encouraging person. This book could help anyone be more, achieve more and feel more life satisfaction.<br /><br />Karl Clauson has a lot of wisdom gained from experience to teach. You can't go wrong spending time reading this encouraging and motivating force for good! This book would make a perfect gift for all your adult family and friends. I'd go so far as to recommend it to complete strangers! It is that good and can benefit anyone who reads it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

        "review_text": "After reading this book I've concluded that no one is a 100% safe person. Some people are just less unsafe than others. In my life, and I'm sure in yours, people have abandoned you, judged you, criticized you, made promises they don't keep, verbally abused you and the list goes on...<br /><br />This book also alerts you to how you may be being used. There may be someone who only contacts you to get support when they are in trouble financially and don't talk to you at other times. As this book states: \"I never hear from her unless she's in trouble.\"<br /><br />The authors discuss subjects like self-righteousness, perfectionism, shaming, defensive devaluation and intimacy avoidance.<br /><br />The most helpful sections of the book include part two which describes why you attract unsafe people and why you continue to choose unsafe relationships. Although after reading about human nature it seems inevitable to have some unsafe people in your life!  While I agree that some character traits attract unsafe people, it can often be as simple as opposites attract. Kind empathetic people often end up with controlling individuals. It can also be a result of how your parents treated you too! This book does also not discuss traumatic bonding.<br /><br />I will say that the authors of this book are extremely insightful and seem to have seen it all. Often they base their conclusions on reliable personal experience and see more deeply than most. They admit their own faults too.<br /><br />On the one hand the authors are right to say you should do your best to stay in your marriage, but even they agree that separation and divorce are things that happen to good people who have the best of intentions. I think if there is physical abuse you should seek safety and call the domestic violence hotline. Emotional abuse can also cause distress and mental illness so be aware of that if you choose to stay - but even God can heal those issues if you are determined not to get a divorce.<br /><br />Some people are staying in their marriages but are on prescription drugs for anxiety and depression. Marriage is not always easy and inevitably there will be conflict. Life is tough and often it can be a game of emotional and physical survival. I've seen a lot of divorce in my family and friendships. I know staying is difficult.<br /><br />One of the most healing things to do in bad relationships is to pray to God and tell him you've decided to stay and pray for a miracle. Sometimes God wants to know you are serious before he will dramatically change a situation. For women I'd also recommend The Praying Wife by Stormie Omartian which is life changing and powerful. There is a book for praying men too but I haven't read it yet.<br /><br />So read this book to avoid getting into new relationships with unsafe people. The authors state that a lot of people leave their relationships after reading this book, which they say is not their intention. I think they just want you to be able to choose safe people from the start! With God's help there is hope for any troubled relationship. But usually people seek counseling or advice from an expert, or read a great book.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

        "motivation_category": "safety",
        "analysis": "This story is logically consistent because it portrays Emily as someone who has been deeply hurt in past relationships and is now taking proactive steps to protect herself from further harm. Her actions, such as reading self-help books and seeking expert advice, demonstrate a desire to educate herself on recognizing unhealthy patterns and cultivating resilience. By categorizing this motivation as 'safety', it aligns with Maslow's hierarchy of needs, as Emily's primary drive is to establish a sense of security and protection in her relationships, which is fundamental to her emotional well-being."

Reading each other's books may ruin the spontaneity of the moment.<br /><br />I will however tell you that I did read both books and they are spot on for teaching spouses to give each other what they need to hear. As someone who has been married now for 27 years I can tell you that my husband and I do tell each other a lot of these things.<br /><br />However I will say that my husband's constructive criticism of my cooking has made my recipes better. Only usually he gives advice on how to make the recipes more delicious. This book advises against even constructive criticism in this area.

The main point of this book is to encourage you to follow an alkaline diet which basically seems to be about increasing fruits and vegetables and taking herbal remedies to detoxify the body.<br /><br />There is an interesting section on what certain cravings mean, so if you crave chocolate you may need CALM, a magnesium supplement. I've found I don't crave chocolate that much at all now that I'm taking CALM in a little water before bed.<br /><br />I did however question advising people to use eucalyptus leaves because I've read you should not ingest eucalyptus oil as it is toxic. So there is that! Maybe do more research.<br /><br />There is some good information on why Irish sea moss is currently so popular. Even I have a bottle, but did not fully understand why it is so essential for health.<br /><br />After reading this book you will not want to make popcorn in bags in the microwave or eat canned green beans. Those tips were helpful for heath reasons. But I don't know if fresh green beans would be any better unless they are organic.<br /><br />So I did learn a lot about herbs and health. I'd suggest reading an entire short book on each herb you intend to try. Some herbs will conflict with your prescription medications and your doctor should be aware of what you are taking.<br /><br />I am not a doctor, nor is this review medical advice. Please consult with your doctor before following the recommendations in this book. This book does recommend eating walnuts and I've found it useful for anxiety. After reading this book however I think you need to read a few books on fasting before trying it. I don't think fasting is for everyone and I personally don't like doing it.

I am not a doctor, nor is this review medical advice, but do more research on that subject.<br /><br />Some interesting topics in this book include the timing of food and insulin usage, the facts about walking and weight loss and why you should stop dieting and start eating healthy delicious foods.<br /><br />Most of this book is recipes so that is good! The ones that looked the most tempting include:<br /><br />Omelet with Wild Mushrooms<br />Warm Pineapple Salsa<br />Lentil Soup with Spinach<br />Asparagus Pizza with Fontina and Truffle Oil<br />Crisp Oatmeal Cookies made with agave nectar and some whole wheat flour<br /><br />There is lastly a section on how to change your eating habits to be more healthy and why you should never skip breakfast.<br /><br />What I did especially enjoy about this particular diabetes book was the section on multicultural eating so you can benefit from a wide variety of cuisines. So overall a great book and this is the second book I've read by Alan L. Rubin on diabetes. I also recommend his Diabetes for Dummies book.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />P.S. I made the lentil soup and it came out delicious. I did add 1 1/2 teaspoons of seasoning salt and added in a little paprika. I only used about 5 ounces baby spinach and left out the ginger.

There on page 95 it does give instructions for how to drink baking soda in water although I found one teaspoon effective.

I still took antibiotics and am taking EU Natura's Harmony Urinary Tract Balance and Cleanse and am feeling so much better. I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice, however I was glad to verify the information I'd read.<br /><br />This book also gives details as to how baking soda can be used for an upset stomach just like an antacid remedy.<br /><br />Other uses detailed in this book include produce wash, meat tenderizing, deodorants, bathing, sugar craving reducer, dishwasher cleaner, laundry solutions, weed killers, skin care, bath soaks, foot soaks, natural toothpaste (nothing is better than a baking soda cleansed mouth!) and playdough.<br /><br />This is probably the only book you'll need on baking soda.

There are at least three people in my life who trigger me and make me lose days of happiness in my otherwise peaceful-reading-in-bed-life!<br /><br />So what is the solution? For some avoiding contact with these types of people works short term, but if this person who drives you crazy is a friend or relative, you may need longer-term coping strategies!<br /><br />When you start reading this book you will instantly feel understood. As Dr. Mike Bechtle says: \"Somehow, drama adds richness to our lives...It is the pain in the present we try to avoid.\"<br /><br />This book is serious in its wise advice, but it is also lol funny in places. By the time I got halfway through the book I had laughed four times. I continued laughing as I read the rest. This author's solutions to common problems are hilarious. He's one of the most creative authors yet!<br /><br />Since relationships are messy, expectations can make them worse. This book helps you decide what you can control and what you can't. This book answers several important questions including:<br /><br />Can people change?<br />What does Scripture say about how we should try to interact with people?<br />Who do you spend the most time with and how does it affect you?<br />Is influence easier than forcing change?<br />Should you respond immediately to an email that angers or annoys you?<br /><br />This author makes a good case for unconditional love. He advises you not to become a victim of someone else's dysfunction. I thought his advice on kindness was invaluable. He also discusses how people push our buttons, situational ethics and self preservation. What he does not talk about are trauma bonds and narcissism which are really some of the reasons problems persist and can be unsolvable short term.<br /><br />I'd say if someone is causing you to become mentally ill due to their abuse it might be time to move on. But even in the worst situations God can give you strength and a love for even your enemies. Really these crazy people are in our lives to help us build character and to help us learn how to love.

        "review_text": "Instantly upon reading this book I could tell that Alan L. Rubin has a heart of compassion for anyone dealing with diabetes. This is the type of book you read with a highlighter in hand to capture all the main points and important details because there is a lot of information on how to manage the condition and prevent complications like eye disease.<br /><br />This book has all the information your own doctor does not have time to tell you. And a lot of it is critical to your survival. Some of the highlights of this book include:<br /><br />Comparison of Blood Glucose Meters<br />Information on Nutritional Plans<br />Considerations about Metabolic Surgery Options<br />Details about Artificial Sweeteners<br />Details on What to Eat and Avoid<br />Information on How To Administer Insulin Injections<br /><br />I was halfway through this book when I started recommending it to people I know who have just recently been diagnosed with diabetes. There are some good exercises in this book that look doable by most anyone except the very frail and then even small weights can be used.<br /><br />The section on surgery did concern me however. Since extreme changes in eating have to be made after surgery I'm thinking that I'd opt for more self-control before considering such drastic options. Metabolic surgery does require adapting food intake so why not just learn how to do that in the first place! Of course consult with your doctor for your best options.<br /><br />Some of the questions this book answers include:<br /><br />What are the complications if you have diabetes and are over 70?<br />Can lack of exercise trigger diabetes?<br />How do you treat hypoglycemia?<br />How many minutes of exercise a day is recommended to keep weight off?<br /><br />There is a good section on Metformin and How to Use Insulin. Alan L. Rubin says that you can only build up muscle by exercising or weight lifting, but I've found pea protein makes me naturally stronger even when I'm not working out constantly.<br /><br />At the end of the book there are recipes that look enticing, including:<br /><br />Shrimp Salad<br />Baked Apples<br />Romaine Salad<br />Summer Minestrone<br />Beef and Broccoli Stir Fry<br /><br />I will definitely try these recipes and I'm also getting the Diabetes For Dummies Cookbook to get more ideas on what to cook. This book briefly discusses diet but I feel most people will need more information to regulate their diet effectively.<br /><br />Since one in three adults will have diabetes in the United States by 2050, this book will be needed by a large amount of the population. I recommend reading it and taking a lot of the advice to heart. I know by reading this it can give you a different perspective and help you prevent more illness down the road.<br /><br />Please consult with your doctor before taking the advice in this book. Although this book is written by a doctor who knows a lot! :)<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

Well until these arguments get constructive. Kim and Penn Holderness have been emotionally distraught, yet they also know how to have fun in their relationship. Penn writes like a journalist and Kim is very real and dynamic. Together they've seen it all! They wrote this book after an obviously intensive session of introspection. Their advice is accurate and will help real-world couples.<br /><br />Here is the deal, their fights are lol funny and enjoyable to read. Hey, they are really creative. By page 5 I had laughed out loud and then I was crying my eyes out. I guess for a few moments there I felt like someone understood what people in long-term-committed marriages go through. It is work to stay married even though you love your spouse more than ever. It is like the longer you are married, the more you argue because I think you get tired of the games each person is playing and see through it!<br /><br />This book may be an emotional rollercoaster ride for you because it so real. I enjoyed the advice to \"stay in the airport\" - that will help me a lot when I get sidetracked. When I told my husband that part of the book he said: \"Exactly! It is like I wrote this book.\" (He really did say it I wrote it down immediately!)<br /><br />The sections on \"magic words\" also gave me hope that any relationship can be loving and compassionate. I wanted to cheer when I read some of the words I'd love to hear my husband say. I especially liked the sections about Kim having big dreams and Penn getting excited about his fame and enjoying it.<br /><br />While reading this book I did think I'd only recommend doing non religious yoga and there were about four swear words in real-world situation, plus a little talk about wine and beer drinking. This couple is a little worldly wise. I did however feel proud of Kim for figuring out how to get her family to do chores in a fun way!<br /><br />So this book has a lot to love and a few things to consider when dealing with your own marriage. To be honest I did not know about this couple until I read this book and found it at amazon. I have never seen their videos. Even so I think they have a lot to offer most couples who have become frustrated with their communication patterns. As someone who is nearing reading 150 marriage and relationship books I can say this one is extremely helpful for the real world. You will laugh and cry while reading it. It is that good! :)<br /><br />Reviewing this book is not an endorsement for the books, movies and people mentioned in this book.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

What to do?<br /><br />If all relationships have some conflicts that produce negative emotions, what can be done to make relationships easier to manage? Alan E. Fruzzetti has developed techniques and strategies for the real world. He teaches you to have more peace and intimacy. He promotes emotional safety in a supportive environment which sounds ideal.<br /><br />Alan E. Fruzzetti begins his book by explaining the complexity of emotions and says that when we manage our emotional response we also alter our thinking and physical actions.<br /><br />This book can be a very therapeutic reading experience because you will realize the author is very in tune with your troubling situation. Most normal people do want harmony and love and really don't enjoy constant conflict.<br /><br />What this book did for me is give me things to talk about that improved my relationship. Reading the section on invalidation was also very useful. I also thought the section on \"accurate communication\" helps you solve a core problem. Saying what you want is far more effective and loving than threatening divorce!<br /><br />Due to some of the content I would only recommend this book to married couples. If I was just dating someone and we were already having arguments about everything I'd run for the hills! Escape while you can! For anyone married this is not always an option. So this book will help you where you are to get you where you want to be. Sometimes knowledge really is power and having the tools to discuss your relationship with your spouse is very helpful and will provide long-term benefits for peace of mind.<br /><br />I would say this is one of the most helpful and effective books on solving marriage problems that I've ever read!

        "review_text": "There are numerous books about interpreting dreams, but few written about the history of dream research or why we dream. So I knew in that respect this book would be entertaining and insightful. Some reasons you may enjoy this book include:<br /><br />You want to figure out why you dream!<br />You have a recurring dream you haven't figured out! (I keep getting lost in a mall.)<br />You enjoy reading about scientific research!<br />You keep a dream journal!<br />You want to know the difference between regular dreams and lucid dreaming!<br /><br />As a science journalist, Alice Robb has a unique and deeply insightful take on what happens during our nocturnal life. She begins her book with a very honest look at lucid dreaming. Since I have lucid dreams quite often I could instantly relate.<br /><br />What impressed me about this book was the eloquent and intellectual writing style that reminds you of the most seasoned journalist. Every minute I spent reading this book it felt like an adventure I was supposed to be reading about.<br /><br />Some of the things I found questionable however was the idea that all religion has its origins in dreams. Maybe for some religions that is true, but God has been speaking to people since the beginning of time! I also think lucid dreams may be important for realizing we are souls that can separate from our bodies, but I'm not sure that it conquers the fear of death like Jesus' words do.<br /><br />There are some rather fascinating ideas like how two people can have the same dream or maybe even meet in a dream as if there is an astral world common to all! That might make you rethink your dreams.<br /><br />So can you induce a dream in someone else? What about predictive dreams that tell the future? I've had those but sometimes I can also hear people's thoughts. I would however not suggest you talk to spiritual entities in dreams unless they were angels. But even then. An angel once talked to me in a dream however and I listened. The angel said: \"Do something for yourself.\" At the time I was not paying my own life as much attention and was helping a lot of people. I suppose the angel was saying I needed a more balanced life and I have become different because of that dream.<br /><br />There are some strange dreams recounted in this book and some border on the erotic. Freud is mentioned quite a bit. But what I loved most about this book was this sentence: \"Becoming aware of your dreams is like dipping into a well of otherwise inaccessible fantasies and fears, signs from our subconscious and creative solutions to projects and problems.\" ~ pg. 4<br /><br />I enjoyed this book even though it took about a week to get through it. I gained many insights into the dream world and now know there are plenty of people who are as interested in dreams as I am. Reviewing this book is however not an endorsement of all the movies, books and individuals mentioned.<br /><br />I will however say my dreams intensified when I started taking sleep aids like Sleep Fairy. I think melatonin can make you dream more vividly. At least that has been the case for me. As someone who sometimes is in a battle with insomnia I'm always grateful when I can fall asleep and have some interesting dreams. I personally think my dream self has an interesting life and I can't wait to see what she does next. lol<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

So you may not be totally responsible for how things always turn out!<br /><br />There is a section on guilt but I've always thought that guilt helps us do the right thing. This book suggests yoga and meditation but I'd only do non religious yoga and meditation. Also the author states that there is nothing good or bad except how we feel about it. This is not 100% true because there is right and wrong. A situation however may look bad and then turn out to be good. I think that is more what the author means.<br /><br />Overall, this book has good advice for those seeking to improve their self-esteem. There is a lot of wisdom obviously born of the author's experiences. It can't hurt you to improve your self-esteem and it is unlikely you'll become a narcissist because you feel love for yourself.

I'm glad I paid attention in science and biology class or this book would be incomprehensible in places. Fortunately there are lots of pictures.<br /><br />This book contains an abundance of witty humor and descriptions that make complete sense. Some of the questions this book answers include: \"Why does perfume last longer on your clothes than skin?\" and \"Do molecules that differ in structure ever smell the same?\" You will also find out how many smell receptors humans have.<br /><br />This author believes in God and Evolution but does not mention either very often. As someone who has successfully copied some of my favorite perfumes by using essential oils I can say this book had me intrigued. One thing I wished while reading this book was for my favorite perfumed soap to still be made. I would love to locate a bar of Opium perfume soap from the 90s! There was nothing like that soap! So this book gave me fond memories of the past.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",
        "scenario": "The user is reminded of a fond memory from their past while reading the book, which sparks a desire to relive that experience again",

        "motivation": "Nostalgia and sentimental longing for a past experience",
        "story": "As Emma sat cozily in her favorite armchair, flipping through the worn pages of her childhood copy of 'Alice in Wonderland,' she was suddenly transported back to afternoons spent at her grandparents' old cottage, where the sweet scent of lavender wafted through the air as she played in the garden, her grandmother gently washing her hands with a soft, fragrant bar of 'Lavender Dream' soap before tea time; now, overcome with nostalgia, Emma felt an overwhelming urge to track down that exact same perfume soap, hoping its familiar fragrance would momentarily reunite her with those idyllic summer days.",
        "motivation_category": "Love needs",
        "analysis": "This story is logically consistent because it establishes a clear connection between the scenario and the character's behavior, driven by the motivation of nostalgia. It falls under the category of esteem because, although nostalgia itself may seem like a sentimental or social motivator, Emma's desire to relive fond memories and reconnect with her past also stems from a deeper need to recapture a sense of security and comfort associated with her childhood experiences, thereby validating her own identity and self-worth, which aligns more closely with the esteem level of Maslow's hierarchy."

Finally there is a book that gives hope to anyone who does not want to gain weight as they age and don't want to lose strength and muscle mass. I found that after 50 I started to lose muscle strength in my arms which really started to scare me! What to do? I upped my protein by eating more pea protein powder drinks. That worked to get my strength back!<br /><br />Stephen Perrine admits that weight gain started to happen to him too and what he wanted was a \"smart, easy, effective eating plan\" for those who are at midlife and beyond.<br /><br />So what does this program promise?<br /><br />Greater Bone Health<br />Healthy Blood Pressure<br />Stabilized Blood Sugar<br />More Mobility with Weight Loss<br />A Reversal in Weight Gain<br />More Muscle and Strength<br /><br />Some of the questions this book answers include:<br /><br />What is protein timing?<br />Why do you need to eat even more fruits and vegetables as you age?<br />How can gaining more muscle prevent belly fat?<br />What protein foods should you eat to get 25-30 grams of protein per meal?<br />What should you eat when dining out?<br />Why is eating fiber important when losing weight?<br />Why is inflammation toxic to muscles?<br />What snacks are actually good for you?<br />Why is sitting too much so bad for your health?<br /><br />This book teaches simple things, like I'm eating more sardines for calcium and vitamin D. This book recommends unsweetened drinks but there is nothing wrong with a packet of stevia to sweeten up your life. Exercise? I'm skipping the advice on HIIT since at my age over 50 it just puts me all out of alignment. I'll stick to more low impact walking.<br /><br />A third of this book is recipes so I'd recommend the hardcover if you intend to cook from the recipes. Some that look great include:<br /><br />Orange Crush Smoothies<br />Basil Turkey Meatballs<br />Roasted Garlic Dressing<br /><br />Yum!<br /><br />The most important part of the book seems to be the sections advising you on what foods to include in your diet. Most are foods you can find at your local grocery store. I'd have to however go someplace else for kale and other less common greens.<br /><br />The tips on how to lose weight are also great!<br /><br />You will find this book to be very informative and that alone will benefit your health. Knowledge is power and if you learn a trick or two about eating healthy and exercising more than this book will be worth reading. I suggest you highlight all the information that seems to benefit you and go back and write down the foods you want to incorporate into your diet. That way you will get practical help from this book.<br /><br />If you have kidney disease or high blood pressure please consult with your doctor before going on any new diet. This is a high protein diet/lifestyle Program for the most part. 25 grams of protein per meal and 5 grams of fiber per meal is recommended by these authors.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />P.S. The turkey meatballs are incredibly good. Worth the price of the book. I skipped the breadcrumbs and added 1/4 teaspoon more salt. Used seasoning salt. They are delicious!",

        "review_text": "Initially, the album A Strangely Isolated Place has the haunting feeling of desolation with warm synthesizer and angelic vocals. It seems to be a journey into nostalgia. It has the same drum beats as \"Far Away Trains Passing\" but is more evolved with newer sounds. What I noticed about Ulrich's earlier albums is his love of water sounds like rain storms and fountains.<br /><br />This album however has a driving force of optimism to it even though the vocals can at times be melancholy. For instance \"On My Own\" seems like a break up song with lyrics like \"I don't need you.\" It ends in psychedelic swirls of chaos that are then balanced by a delicate conclusion.<br /><br />\"A letter from home\" is gorgeous in its simplicity but it does have those driving beats that are less prominent in later music.<br /><br />\"Monday - Paracetamol\" is more expansive in consciousness and has familiar melodies. A thunder storm appears and then there are warm washes of sound enveloping your mind.<br /><br />\"Clear Day\" is intense.<br /><br />\"Blumenthal\" is dreamy with guitar and lonely landscapes with a sense of joy. The xylophone sounds are pretty.<br /><br />\"In All the Wrong Places\" has the sounds of outer space planets with softer beats and more xylophone sounds which give it a magical feel and this then includes angelic vocals with a few falling stars.<br /><br />\"A Strangely Isolated Place\" seems happy to be existing as a warm ending with radiant bursts of light. Then there seems to be a hidden track that plays afterwards and you can only access it by listening to track 8.<br /><br />Ulrich seems to have been exploring many moods of his soul on this album. There is dark moody chaos and also bright brilliant love which becomes more prominent as his albums progress into the future. It would be interesting to read an autobiography and find out what was going on in his life around the time this album was created!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

        "review_text": "Classic Ulrich from over 20 years ago still has a universal appeal. You enter this album expectant and it takes you on a carefree journey of relaxation and mental release. This was one of the first electronica albums I ever heard and it is not as layered as \"Goodbye\" or later albums. It has a purity of sound that is unique to Ulrich's earlier albums. There are however more rhythmic elements on this album that make you feel like you are on a train riding into the future to some new adventure.<br /><br />What captivates me about this music is its solitary beauty and the beginnings of the metamorphosis that has led to Ulrich's brilliant later albums. But I think Ulrich was always on the cutting edge even at the beginning because there is a sparkle to his music that has kept me a fan all these years. It is rare for me to want to collect all of an artist's albums as I am doing lately!<br /><br />The tracks on this album are also long enough that you can saturate in the sounds for an immersive experience. So if you want to go back in time and are intrigued with electronica's evolution you will find this still has a lot of warmth and memories but the synthesizer sounds and persistent drum beats do date this album a bit here and there.<br /><br />\"Nobody's Home\" on this album seems like a breakthrough into more like what Ulrich was really capable of and what his music was becoming.<br /><br />The bonus disc has music that also emphasizes the heavier drum beats. \"Sunday evening in your street\" has an experimental feel. \"Crazy for You\" is worth hearing and has a soothing repetitive nature and is almost hypnotic. \"Wherever you are\" has echoes of future albums that branch off into musical ecstasy like Goodbye.<br /><br />To be honest, this was my introduction to Ulrich's music and I'm glad I got to hear it again. It shows me what electronica used to sound like and how far things have progressed.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review, a fan",

The lyrics actually speak of victory in the face of difficulty.<br /><br />I've heard two of the songs on Christian radio but hearing all the songs was quite the experience. I'd say some of these songs are more bouncy soul pop while others are more serious. Either way you will find songs you can relate to no matter where you are in life or what you are facing.

This is a combined recording of two concerts they did at the Orpheum Theater in Omaha, Nebraska. It runs for about an hour so plenty of music to enjoy. If you want more music there are five bonus performances that you can play one after the other so it extends the concert a bit.<br /><br />Some of the music is very recognizable like Faeries and O' Little Town of Bethlehem. I also loved Carol of the Bells and Silent Night which was performed by Chip Davis and his two daughters. His daughter, Elyse Davis also sings Greensleeves beautifully.<br /><br />This concert makes use of modern and classical instruments. Violins play along with electric guitar, flute and drums play along with French horns and a harpsichord. It is really all quite beautiful. I thought at times there were echoes of the medieval which make it memorable.<br /><br />While watching this concert, Chip Davis does commentary between songs and an introduction before the concert starts. I found that very enjoyable and it added new dimensions to the understanding of how this music was produced. It is worth watching to see his pet wolf and horses.<br /><br />The musicians also seem to be having such fun so it was as interesting to watch them play their instruments as it was to hear the music itself. They seem to be expressing so much Christmas joy and when they play the more reverential selections like O Holy Night you can sense that they know the meaning of Christmas itself.<br /><br />I enjoyed this concert in the comfort of my living room.

The exquisite cello and violin awakens the heart while the piano is psychologically calming. I thought this was perfect and I will listen to this again and again. My husband came into the kitchen and said this sounded like music he would have heard at a party years ago. He's a big fan of classical music so happy he loves this too. We also played this CD during dinner a night later and it we had a really good conversation. I think the classical music calms you and makes you more open to communicating.

When I went to order more of these I noticed I'd purchased them already and went to look. Sure enough there they were and what a relief. Two pills help stop the urgency of the feelings and take away any pain. Your pee will change color however and I suggest you wear a pad or underwear can be stained. So definitely don't wear your most expensive pair when using these pills. Otherwise they are great!

Gary Chapman has seen it all and finally wrote this book for couples experiencing things like alcoholism, verbal abuse, physical abuse, controlling spouses or even irresponsible mates that betray.<br /><br />You may feel desperate, like you are the only one working on your marriage. Fortunately, one person can do a lot to keep a marriage together! There are more options than leaving, death, divorce or being miserable. Why become a prisoner of limited choices? This book advises you to get into tough love mode and to practice reality living.<br /><br />Gary Chapman spends some time explaining why in some cases divorce may just not be the best choice. We know divorce causes a lot of emotional upset and can be one of the most stressful life situations. Gary Chapman believes divorce should be the last option when everything else has already been tried. He believes in good counseling for sure!<br /><br />How can you maintain a sense of hope and positive mental attitude when a marriage is falling apart or dying a slow death of disregard? How can two people wake up and solve their issues breathing new life into an long-term love?<br /><br />This book answers some questions about how an individual can fight for their marriage and be influential even with a spouse who doesn't seem to be getting the initial message. Gary Chapman discusses the five love languages. And says if that doesn't work there are other options. He also discusses love, freedom, significance and peace with God. There is good advice like asking your spouse what is the one thing that I can do to make your life easier? This is a servant attitude for sure and will bring you much joy if you follow the advice.<br /><br />There is an especially good section on how to deal with a depressed spouse or one who is verbally abusive. This book gives step-by-step instructions to the concerned spouse in order for them to facilitate change and healing.<br /><br />As Gary says: \"Love is the most powerful weapon for good in the world.\"<br /><br />Gary discusses the emotional need for companionship and he understands that you want your marriage to work and that you love your spouse so much. Instead of enabling bad behavior he teaches a form of reality living where you hold your spouse accountable for their actions and words. He does not at all say to be passive and let the abuse continue. He seems to encourage some spouses to even leave for a time and to demand the errant spouse get help before they return.<br /><br />Gary Chapman's counseling helps save marriages and while I can't guarantee reading this book will always work, I can say he's on the right track and things he believes will work have been tried and tested by his clients. You don't always need extensive degrees in a field to be influential and wise. I think this book has a lot of wisdom and I'm happy I read it. There is hope even in the toughest times and you have a lot of power over your life and your marriage. Marriage is not easy but it is worth it to keep your spouse and to show them love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review, married 26 years and has read over 120 relationship books and still learning something new about marriage!",

You may feel tired of the abuse and resulting trauma but feel there is no way to escape? You can refuse to return emails, you can refuse to answer the phone, but somehow these people won't leave you in peace even when you ask them to make the right choice.<br /><br />So what questions will this book answer for you?<br /><br />How can I understand the narcissistic mind?<br />Why should I have compassion for someone with NPD?<br />Why are narcissists so unhappy with even constructive criticism?<br />What is the difference between grandiose and vulnerable narcissism?<br />Are narcissists really just difficult to please perfectionists?<br />How can I stop being lured into narcissistic mind games?<br /><br />For once, this book explains treatment of NPD which most books on narcissism don't even give hope for. This book explains gaslighting which is something a narcissist did to me recently to try to make me doubt my own memory. Trust me I remember when someone says something aggressive to me!<br /><br />Some of the techniques that have been helping me is the \"grey rock method\" which is explained in this book. To preserve your sanity it might be the best option. This book has good advice on dealing with a narcissistic parent, sibling or ex spouse when co parenting.<br /><br />There is also a good discussion on narcissists and codependents and why they go together so often. If you want to feel needed, many narcissists will sense this and attach themselves to you for as long as they can.<br /><br />So overall a good book on what to expect.

Then of course after you tell the narcissist that they are being selfish, they will turn around and ask you for a favor! It is unbelievable how a total lack of self awareness occurs on all levels.<br /><br />As someone who deals with a variety of different narcissistic personalities I can say that this book deals with some of the most toxic narcissists you will ever encounter on a page! I hope you never meet anyone like this in real life because it will shock you out of your complacency!<br /><br />Deeply knowledgeable Psychotherapist Linda Martinez-Lewis begins her book by describing the supernarcissist who she describes as someone you have worked hard to love, even often making incredible sacrifices. She says they \"most likely will never change.\" And that seems true from my own experiences and research but God may have other plans.<br /><br />What was deeply enlightening was this quote: \"The child who must forfeit his authenticity to survive is the adult filled with rage.\" This has two angles. First it could be the narcissist who is filled with rage or it can be the adult child of a narcissist who has woken up to the abuse and has seen the light. This produces a lot of anger, especially if the subconscious has somehow been awakened.<br /><br />What are the typical behaviors to watch for? Lack of empathy, a grandiose sense of self-importance, fantasies of unlimited power, a love of money, a need for excessive compliments and attention are all what you will find when you deal with a supernarcissist.<br /><br />What I loved about this book was the high-level creative and intellectual writing and deep insight into the mind of a narcissist. This book goes beyond textbook narcissism and revels in variety. As the author says: \"The moment you cease to satisfy his endless ego needs, the narcissist will dispose of you.\" Well unless you run first!<br /><br />This book excels at showing how the parents of narcissists are involved in their development. It also explains what happens as the narcissist ages. It isn't pretty.<br /><br />Some of the things this book discusses in detail is the recurrent pattern of people making work a priority instead of their family and also emotional cruelty, devaluation and abuse.<br /><br />The author is definitely wise in many ways and she mentions Jesus, although she seems to only think of him as enlightened. There is a lot of discussion about meditation and yoga although I'd only recommend the non religious kind or some of the newer Christian yoga DVDs. Chants and mantras can be religious and I prefer to know who I'm praying to! There is a discussion on death, reincarnation, cosmic consciousness, karma and various beliefs in Buddhism.<br /><br />My suggestion is after reading this book you get the book called DONE by Cary Schmidt. That helps the reader to understand that life continues after death and that you can choose where you go. Which is all very helpful for giving you peace of mind in a world of narcissism.<br /><br />So yes I did enjoy this book and I think it is helpful for seeing what narcissism does to people. This book seems to center on a lot of womanizers who perpetrate psychological abuse. This can be helpful if you want to avoid them!!!!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

So when she is chosen to present herself to the king as a future possible queen we know this is going to be an interesting decision. I thought Joel Smallbone was an excellent king. He had a majestic air about him and made his proclamations with conviction. Jen Lilley is a favorite Hallmark actress and she plays her part so wonderfully in this meaningful movie.

I was amazed at his performance and his spiritual transformation from grumpy and horrid to happy and appreciative of life was a wonder to behold.<br /><br />I am a fan of Patrick Stewart's version of this movie and had never imagined a musical version at all. Until I found this movie the other day I did not know it existed. The only thing I'd say is that there is a little swearing so it might not be appropriate for young viewers, but it aptly portrays Scrooge in the worst possible light.<br /><br />What I also thought while viewing is this has more horror elements than most versions. They really play up those aspects, especially the ghosts. The scenes in the graveyard are quite scary but not too much.<br /><br />I also thought Jane Krakowski as the ghost of Christmas past lent some beauty to the film I had not otherwise seen in other versions. Her gown is just gorgeous and they make sure to keep a fan blowing on her dress as it seems she is constantly in a breezy state even while standing in indoor scenes.<br /><br />What this really is is a little bit of horror and a lot of singing and dancing. I'd call it a bit of an extravaganza to be honest. At times this movie is boisterous and busy and at times deeply thoughtful. I thought it was very well done even though I could have done without the occasional swearing. It was at least part of the character development. And the ending is magnificent. Better than I've ever seen.<br /><br />To be honest I was a bit grumpy myself the past few days but after I saw this movie I totally got back into the Christmas spirit.

Her choice of watching a Christmas movie musical aligns with her desire to feel a sense of connection and community, which is a fundamental aspect of the social category in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. By doing so, Emily satisfies her emotional need for belonging and togetherness during the holiday season."

The whole story line leads up to the moment where everyone finds out the real meaning of Christmas.<br /><br />Probably this is the highest rated Christmas special because everyone is really like Charlie Brown who is seeking deeper meaning in life.<br /><br />My husband remembers seeing this when he was only two years old and has seen it so many times since. This was probably the second time I've seen this and the first time I got myself a copy. I just love seeing Snoopy jumping around being his happy dog self. You gotta love that!

        "review_text": "I'm convinced that Lacey Chabert can take on any role, even the part of Darcy, a wealthy financial investor in NY who wants to do more for the people in her city who may not have the minimum financial requirements to invest with her. She has a dream of helping others but her partner is just not interested in going the extra mile. So while she's on vacation visiting her parents things start happening in NY that are constantly on her mind. How can she enjoy Christmas with her family when her work partner is taking over the company?<br /><br />Then to complicate things when she gets home she finds her old boyfriend still interested in getting back together. He says they are meant to be but Darcy is not sure and is hesitant to make any promises. Really her heart is saying no very loudly but she tries to be polite.<br /><br />When she reconnects with Luke, her old debate partner who is now running a restaurant, things start warming up in her hometown. He helps cater a big event that is going to help the community. She sees him in a new light as someone his father would be proud of. Sparks start to fly and chemistry warms up even though at first they have a lot of exchanges with spontaneous witty banter. Jane Austen would have approved!<br /><br />Some of the beautiful moments I enjoyed watching include the very comforting conversation Darcy has with her father who shares with her some of his wisdom and advice. Darcy's mother also has a warm personality and seems to care about everyone and is especially happy her daughter is visiting for the holidays.<br /><br />So this movie is not exactly like Pride and Prejudice unless you look for little hints throughout. I think basically just the names of the characters are similar with Darcy now being a woman and Luke being a male Elizabeth.<br /><br />The only thing I did really wonder about was how on earth were they going to get the custom decorated Christmas trees home after the auction. Maybe someone would have to special deliver them later.<br /><br />So if you are looking for witty dialogue and warm chemistry there is plenty of that. The feelings of home and love and holiday joy is evident throughout. Lacey Chabert looks stunning and beautiful in all her outfits and when Brendan Penny dresses up he's quite the handsome suitor.<br /><br />If you are thinking this will play out exactly as Jane Austen's book Pride and Prejudice goes there are quite a few changes and differences. Still on its own this movie makes a wonderful holiday special that can be enjoyed each year. There is only one true kiss under the mistletoe at the end. Darcy does give Luke a peck on the cheek earlier in the movie and holds his hand. Just look out for the snowballs! Cute!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

        "review_text": "When Hallmark puts three movies in a set there is usually a reason and generally I can figure it out after watching all three movies. In this set it is all about people we forget, people we remember and people we forget and then remember again. It really is that simple.<br /><br />In Christmas On My Mind this movie follows the typical plot of going home again. The only problem is Lucy has fallen and hit her head and is experiencing short-term amnesia. This results in a lot of uncomfortable moments with the man she is supposed to be engaged to but can't remember. Two years of her life is suddenly missing in her memory. When she realizes she has planned a wedding with this man who she doesn't know she is confused and decides to take thing slow. Maybe even try to get her memories back.<br /><br />However instead of spending time with her current love she decides to go back home and reconnect with her past boyfriend. She seems to want to figure out what happened when they broke up. So who will win her heart...the ex boyfriend or the new man who wants to marry her and has the date set? And will her memories return and upset the whole situation even once she decides?<br /><br />In Holiday Hearts we again find a very uncomfortable situation. Peyton and Ben sort of remember each other because at one point Peyton had told Ben she had feelings for him and he had run far and away. But what was his real reason? That is the clue to how this turns out. When Ben's best friend's daughter need to be looked after while the friend is having surgery, Peyton and Ben spend a lot of time making this adorable little girl's every Christmas tradition and wish come true because her mother passed away a while ago and she has no one around to help her celebrate the holidays. They are basically playing house, cooking meals, telling bedtime stories, decorating with lights so they start to have feeling for each other again.<br /><br />One issue in this movie is that Peyton leaves planning a huge function until the last minute. Sure it turns out great but realistically she must have needed a lot of help to pull off this Christmas magic. Then Ben is supposed to leave and fly overseas to be a doctor in another country. Will he change his mind now that he is falling in love with Peyton all over again? Tricky situation. I was glad this one turned out great.<br /><br />In Homecoming for the Holidays a lot of people are remembered and no one is forgotten. This movie is a lesson in how to be the ideal parent, child, friend, community helper, the list goes on and on. Each scene was just a storybook of how things should be in the world. Everyone helped when there was a need, everyone said the right comforting words, everyone cared about their relatives and friends feelings. Seriously this is one of the most perfect Hallmark movies I've ever watched and I've seen it twice. The chemistry between Country singer Charlotte and ex-soldier Matt simmers under the surface until they both decide what they want. There is a lot of intellectual considerations but in the end the heart knows what it wants. This is one of those movies where the chemistry just sizzles from the start.<br /><br />So if you are looking for themes of forgetting and remembering you will find a lot to love in these three movies. If you love those movies where a person wakes up after a concussion and can't remember their life you will love Christmas on My Mind the most.<br /><br />Enjoy these and Merry Christmas!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

The only thing is if you want to get back to the main menu it can take a few steps but not difficult to figure out at all. Wherever you start the DVD it just plays continuously from there.

The witty banter between Andrea Bocelli and David Foster keep you entertained while waiting for the next song. Andrea even plays the piano while singing the most famous song in Italy. Whether he's singing in Italian, English or French, listening to his voice is a spectacular experience that may make you feel a little misty eyed because of the beauty. I admit he made me cry a few times.<br /><br />To top it all off there is even a fireplace while singing The Christmas Song with Natalie Cole. Reba McEntire is perfect singing Blue Christmas and Mary J. Blige adds a lot of soul to What Child Is This? I had never heard Katherine Jenkins before but she sings like an angel. When singing with The Muppets, Miss Piggy looks on adoringly as Andrea sings. It was the cutest!<br /><br />Many of these songs will make you feel nostalgic, especially Silent Night sung in Italian and English. The powdery blue lights made everything look so peaceful and calm.<br /><br />This was filmed at the formerly named Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, California. To be honest this was quite the production! The last song White Christmas even had snow falling on the stage. It was just magical.<br /><br />In the extras, Andrea Bocelli also has many profound and beautiful things to say about the music of Christmas.

Patti (Hayley Mills) figures out that someone has written the start of Help on the back.

I found there were several cringe worthy scenes in which I felt sorry for the men.<br /><br />From marriage books we all now know that being respected is one of the top needs of men. I'd say respect actually goes both ways with women needing it too.<br /><br />So a woman critiquing a man harshly when he is trying to impress her with his knowledge seems a little over the top. She could have given more constructive feedback from the start I think. A woman coaching a man in speed skiing to the point where he overextends himself seems hash too even though it turns out OK in the end. A woman who expects a man to go without sports and a TV for a month...what a shocking thing. lol The man rents a TV because the woman would not get the TV in the apartment fixed. I don't even have cable but most men would object to not having something to watch for a month! Some have iPhones to watch videos I guess.<br /><br />There seemed to be no occurrence in these woman's minds that a man has needs too! So I'd say I was a bit uncomfortable watching these movies with my husband. That is all I have to say! Well I said a lot to my husband while watching these! I don't think realistically any of these women would have gotten the man! Or at least they would have had to change slightly to keep the man! These movies definitely are the fix a man fantasy.

There is a little discussion of Norse myths and legends and Chloe, the main character carries around a book reading from it often.<br /><br />The story is that Chloe and Charlie were once a couple and somehow they just drifted off in different directions. Now that Charlie has been invited on an Icelandic adventure with all his old friends can he resist falling in love with Chloe again. He seems eager to make her happy and does some incredible things that show he wants Chloe's dreams to come true.

But when a man has made a commitment to marry a woman can you trust him when he changes his mind in a few days? Will he change his mind again after marrying the new woman? Metcalfe and Reeser are great actors but I just did not feel like the movie was totally realistic. It is definitely a fantasy written by a hopeless romantic. Who wants a guy who just got rid of his woman? Doesn't he need some time to change gears? Well at least two people get what they want. That is all that counts in this movie.

She scrutinized every plot twist, every declaration of devotion, and every happily-ever-after, hoping to glean some insight into what made a partnership truly tick, and how she could avoid the heartache she'd endured in the past.

At first they complain about dog barking and loud music but soon become best friends.<br /><br />These two are not dating but end up spending a lot of quality time together hanging out at each other's homes. Nothing happens until the guy's ex girlfriend shows up and tries to reclaim him as her own. This of course wakes up the weather girl who realizes she may have lost her chance at love.<br /><br />So the plot is simple and yet lots of sweet romantic moments occur throughout - a lot of umbrella scenes and downpours. A lot of storms and rain.<br /><br />Will science or nature win in the end?<br /><br />The gang is back on this one, you may recognize them from the Glamping movie.<br /><br />Romance in the Air<br /><br />The serene views of Lake Tahoe are worth spending the time to watch this movie but I'm not really sure how I feel about the outcome. The woman who is the main character seems to be living with her boyfriend, or at least seems on intimate terms with him and he's in her house. Of course going on vacation changed all that. How quickly can you fall in love with someone else? Apparently fast if you happen to have a history with this person.<br /><br />Well it seems like everything works out OK for everyone and there are no hard feelings. Even though the boyfriend seems like a good guy, he really has a secret. At least everyone was spared the pain of marrying the wrong people. Although it seems to me it is the guys in this movie who really luck out.<br /><br />It also felt like the main character took the easy way out and was not upfront about having a boyfriend. I wonder if a Hallmark movie ever ends the way you don't expect it to! OK there were a few surprises but otherwise a normal course of events.<br /><br />Cindy Busby was her normal energetic self in both movies. She's a great actress and I always enjoy seeing how she become the part.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

She couldn't help but smile as she reflected on her own past relationships, drawing parallels between the characters' journey and her own experiences.

I've seen four versions and this is the most romantic and has the most wonderful flirting between Darcy and Elizabeth.<br /><br />Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier really had the best onscreen chemistry I've ever seen. Greer Garson positively sparkles and Laurence Olivier is truly chivalrous in this part. But what I loved most about this movie is the scene between Darcy and his Aunt when the Aunt has just finished talking to Elizabeth. This is now my favorite black-and-white movie I've ever seen. The sisters are all delightful and the mother is the most likeable. The father is charming too.<br /><br />It took me two days to watch this since it is so long but it was worth the effort. So if you are a fan of Jane Austen adaptations, this is a must see because it is the most romantic and emotionally fulfilling version. I'd go all out and say you will just be totally charmed by this movie. It is a true classic and worth collecting. Witty repartee included!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

As Aimie she's taken on the issue of preserving the town's oldest tree where people love to picnic and gather. This beloved tree is truly a part of the community. The mayor wants it taken down because it is causing problems with the pipes and they feel they can no longer afford the maintenance. Trevor Donovan plays Kyle Sorensen who has been hired to cut down the tree as soon as possible. Only problem is Aimie has decided it just isn't going to happen on her watch and takes up residence in the tree.<br /><br />This movie has lots of cute romance including a picnic at a table under the tree. People help Aimie build a temporary treehouse and she continues to chain herself to the tree for most of the movie. Well she gets breaks as others join forces to help her around the clock. But what happens when for minutes at a time Aimie's mom leaves her position at the tree? Is it game over? Will Kyle win? Does he still want to win?<br /><br />What I could admire about Kyle's character that he helps Aimie out when she is in trouble and needs a chivalrous man to step in and take charge. His steely blue eyes are amazing and he seems like he could chop down the tree in a few well placed swings of his axe. But will he do it?<br /><br />This is a cute romance with lots of banter between Aimie and Kyle. They have some really good arguments and let each other know exactly what they are thinking. So with that much passionate energy going towards a fight they might just learn to like each other in the end.<br /><br />Loved this movie and look forward to watching it again.

This sure does complicate things until she reconnects with her first love, French pen pal Jacques played by Joshua Sasse.<br /><br />Joshua Sasse's accent is great and sets the tone for a French romance with interesting dynamics and a little romantic tension. What ends up happening is Victoria's ex boyfriend decides he wants her back. Probably because he sees another man interested in her and this fuels his competitive streak. So the question is, will Victoria end up back with her ex or move on to new things with Jacques?<br /><br />The wedding couple in this movie seems to be sharing a room at the hotel before the wedding, but otherwise this is a sweet innocent romance with only barely a kiss. I loved how Mallory Jensen looks a lot like Brooke Shields and that her acting vividly portrays devastation and uncomfortable moments with her ex. You can really feel her pain and sympathize with her situation. Since I had a bad breakup with my ex after four years of dating I could see why she might be slightly annoyed with the whole situation being the relationship never got to the married state. With only six months between the wedding and breakup you can understand that it is a bit much to handle!<br /><br />The couple getting married in this movie is very sweet and I loved the kind things they said to each other and how they truly seemed to feel an eternal kind of love. With the bride being of an indecisive nature the whole wedding is nearly called off however and that complicates everyone's plans.<br /><br />What I loved about this movie was how it reminded me of my trip to Paris with my best college friend in 1996. It was great to see the Eiffel Tower again and remember the Louvre and other attractions in France. I agree with the characters saying Paris is the most romantic place on earth. I really think my husband should have taken me instead of sending me away on a vacation with a friend!!!! But hey, at least I got to see Paris. :)<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

There are some good plot twists and activities like kayaking and horseback riding. Wyoming is beautiful or is it a ranch in Canada? Well the fantasy is that it is in Wyoming.<br /><br />As this show progresses you get your own ideas about who should be together. There are really three couples that end up together by the end of the movie. The three women are a long-time visitor who wants to work on the ranch, Alex's mother who has a shy suitor and Stephanie who is there for the reality TV show. The men are an elderly gentleman who has frequented the ranch twice a year, Oliver the bachelor and Alex, the ranch owner's son.<br /><br />There are marshmallows roasting by an open fire, hiking trips, hot air balloon rides and plenty of feasting and parties. There is even a picnic. So lots to love if you enjoy living vicariously.<br /><br />I loved this movie because I was rooting for the right characters to get together. That way I was not disappointed. You will be happy with how everything works out in the end.<br /><br />And I was excited that Alex at least acknowledged that there is a master plan behind everything helping things workout the way they are supposed to.

The two main characters are likeable but I did not like the female lead character suggesting the male lead's daughter get so involved with a boy at a young age.

It is interesting to see them managing to appreciate each other again after their former misunderstandings. I have not watched a lot of soap operas in my life and really there was very little to do with the soap opera that is being filmed. Most of this movie focuses on the relationship between the two main characters. Maggie goes all out to convince Darin to be on the show again. Since he is her ex boyfriend it is really a humbling experience.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Love For Real because it is about a reality dating show and they kept things pretty innocent. Most of the movie was about two girls and how they got what they wanted out of life in love and work. You have a fashion designer who thinks the show is the perfect opportunity to show off her clothing line. And you have her best friend who thinks if she places second on the show she'll go on to greater things on TV. If you like to see a few girls getting a little catty and love the idea of women fighting for a man's attention then this may amuse you to no end. There are several unique plot twists that I enjoyed and I loved that the movie ends with happily ever after for two women. Hayley and Bree are really a trip - all their scheming seems to pay off! I look forward to watching this again.<br /><br />These are about PG 13 for the most part. There is a little kissing and that is about it. :) There is one part where a woman is in a bathing suit but it is fairly modest on a beach.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

So you have two actors who look like they are super famous and they have to pull off a travel show in three weeks in Hawaii.<br /><br />Pascale Hutton is play-by-the-books Paige who when she decides to have fun shocks people with the novelty. Kavan Smith as Ben shows what it is like to live spontaneously and laugh as you go along despite making a fool of yourself on camera. Paige has a video online that has been seen by 10 million viewers but she considers it her worst moment and the reason she got out of television hosting in the first place.<br /><br />So you can see how opposites start to attract. The more this movie progresses, the more we find out how different two people can be. And yet, they sort of have the same dreams about life.<br /><br />This movie has a lot about Hawaiian culture and traditions. There is some sensual dancing and feasting. The movie takes off in all sorts of directions and Paige and Ben have real chemistry. However is it the Hawaii bubble that is about to pop? Can these two unique individuals survive a romance in such a beautiful location. What will happen next?<br /><br />I enjoyed the humor and spontaneity and how this had a slightly different Casablanca twist. Because Ben is such a guy's guy men will love this movie as much as their women.

Matt falls for one of the dancers which means Annie is left out in the cold a lot. She starts dating the choreographer as a sort of coping strategy when she becomes jealous about Matt's love interest. It doesn't help that Annie helped Matt get this new girl interested by telling Matt how to win her heart.<br /><br />Well soon Matt is inspired and baking the best bread on the Island. When they all get in the news, the town is ecstatic about all the new tourists coming from the mainland. It really is a huge celebration and plans are made for more media attention.

What is the reason and can the town pull together to make him a success again?<br /><br />The ending is really unexpected. This movie has a French-themed romance and the music is cute and endearing. I loved this movie and laughed a lot. I think I laughed so much I didn't talk to my husband much through the movie which made him happy. So really a captivating movie with stars that you learn to love and cheer for! Few movies make me care about the characters, but Annie and Matt are special in that regard.<br /><br />I also admit that watching Brant Daugherty bake in his bakery was about as romantic as it gets for a cook like me. I told my husband I had to go get a piece of bread with butter immediately if not sooner! So maybe don't watch this movie unless you have a loaf of French bread and butter in your home.<br /><br />This is now one of my favorite Hallmark movies and I don't like all of them!

She meets him again when he is flying a plane for his brother's company. Little does she know he is suffering from major PTSD and even the sound of bubble wrap popping sets him off.<br /><br />It is difficult for Dr. Maggie not to want to play savior and fix Finn's issues. He has the idea that he is going to California to forget all the bad things that have happened to him. Except there is a slight issue with an inheritance and the requirement that he stay and help Maggie open the clinic. He has 30 days to stay in Alaska and after finding out his brother's company is going under he decides to take the money and help his brother.<br /><br />For most of the movie you have two people who love each other who are fighting like crazy to not admit it. How can it work out when the issues are so insurmountable?<br /><br />If you like Hallmark movies you may enjoy this one. There is some pretty scenery and lots of cold weather and snow. I however wish that the dog had been more a part of the whole movie than just a few scenes. He was a beautiful dog and deserved more of the spotlight. I thought the woman who showed her cat photos to Finn made the movie funny in places. She has her eye on Finn for sure and wins a date with him at the bachelor auction.<br /><br />So will Maggie and Finn ever come to terms with their feelings? Watch this to not know right up until the end. There are some intense scenes of the PTSD experiences Finn suffers from. They seemed totally realistic. Can he get help before it is too late?

For this it was terribly entertaining to me at least. And in Royal Hearts I laughed a lot because the King really did get what he wanted in the end. Royal Matchmaker could not have turned out better. And Once Upon a Prince is sweet beyond all belief.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to spend a few days watching these romances progress and comparing the similarities and differences of the female lead's experiences. Sure these women are wowed when a king takes interest in them, but sometimes a father can figure out who really is right for the daughter. I watched these three movies with my husband and we totally enjoyed them. The castles were amazing and the gowns gorgeous. To even have a fantasy of this type of life is well worth enjoying.

But his mom really doesn't want to move out of her beautiful beach house which has always been her escape and felt like her real home.<br /><br />Some of the fun things in this movie include watching turtles hatch. There are walks on the beach and glasses of sweet tea. This was filmed in Georgia so it is really pretty.<br /><br />Once Cara discovers the family secret it changes the whole trajectory of her life. Will she go back to Chicago with her boyfriend or stay on for more than the summer and get involved with Brett who I think is the most likeable guy in this movie.<br /><br />My husband and I agreed that this movie was a little different than most Hallmark movies we've watched lately. It was not as light and breezy, the characters were more entangled emotionally and there were some points of higher drama where a woman is trying to live her life while her kids are planning to sell her home.<br /><br />It all works out in the end because fate works that way. I was not a surprised by the ending as I was amazed how all the puzzle pieces eventually fit.

I watch the movies and TV series with unabashed adoration and can't think of any romance that is more beautiful and thrilling. So I was absolutely taken with the idea of another modern interpretation. I loved the first movie, it was perfect in every way. You have cute dogs, a couple that has real chemistry and enough annoying characters to create real conflict. The whole time you are wondering how each classic character is going to be portrayed next and it is amazing really how this movie evolves.<br /><br />After the first movie you know Mr. Darcy and Lizzie are going to proceed to a wedding. What you don't realize is that it is going to be horrendous and will upset you greatly. Lizzie turns into a woman I didn't recognize as a Jane Austen character. All the pouting and me, me, me. I was literally talking to the screen and to my husband while watching exclaiming how ungrateful and selfish Lizzie was acting. I could not believe it. She's got the man of her dreams, why does the wedding have to be exactly like she wants it or else? I thought at times she was not fully considering what Mr. Darcy wanted and he wanted to honor all the people in his life who meant a great deal to him. Plus he's obviously paying for everything so why should he get less of a vote.<br /><br />Well I will say the second movie left me very conflicted and I thought it was no way to promote how a woman should act when she is getting married. But all ends well I suppose with a surprise ending. I guess I was just disappointed with how Lizzie acted. You should be able to get what you want, but you have to consider two families. When I got married the guest list was very long! We honored both our mothers by inviting everyone they wanted to invite. It was a garden wedding so there was a lot of room for hundreds of guests.<br /><br />I think I struggled to appreciate Lizzie's attitude throughout the second movie. Jane Austen would most likely not really approved. Maybe the best Hallmark movies don't include the details of planning a whole wedding. It really is super stressful to watch someone go through that and to make everyone happy compromises have to be made. For sure!  Had Lizzie been more humble and grateful for all the things everyone was trying to do for her, I'd have felt different about the second movie. So it goes...<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

He's even fixed up his home with his handyman talents and rents it out. He knows how to decorate - I loved the couch! He also has a really cute dog. So when Caroline (Cindy Busby) inherits the restaurant and arrives from New York, what is he to do? He doesn't relish losing his job and everyone working at the restaurant is extremely dedicated and hard working. No one wants things to change!<br /><br />This is where it gets interesting because Caroline has the idea that they should update their menu and she's even thinking of selling the place because after all she has a big-time chef job in New York and can't be in two places at once. What she doesn't expect is to be wooed by Simon's Australian charm. And Australian men can be very much a fantasy for some American women. They are just so polite and seem to want to make you happy.<br /><br />The problem with Caroline is that she's so ambitious she just can't relax and taking time off from work is seemingly not her idea of fun. Although to be honest she has a lot of cute casual clothes that seem to say vacation!<br /><br />I loved the scene where Simon and Caroline sneak into the restaurant kitchen and take a look at the ice cream selection. Raspberry mango had my attention. There is also a beautiful party with great lighting and music. Simon learns that change can be good and Caroline gets to prove she is pretty good in the kitchen and can even handle making culinary favorites with variations.<br /><br />Overall I felt this movie had all those classic elements of combat before falling in love and Simon and Caroline have great chemistry and they know how to have a good argument or food fight. The only problem is they are both dedicated to their jobs and it doesn't look like either one is willing to move to another country.<br /><br />So the whole time you are watching you have a question in your mind. Who is going to stay and who is going to leave? Well to be honest it doesn't work out like I thought it would. Maybe this type of situation works for some people but it is not ideal. So if you love a movie that has a huge issue and problem that needs to be solved you will enjoy this one! I won't tell you the ending and it is a good surprise.<br /><br />Did I mention this movie has the most adorable dog in it?

The laughs just kept coming and his witty comments made his character David alive and interesting. I've never heard any man utter such romantic lines in a movie and he sounded so compassionate and genuine.<br /><br />Erin Krakow as Elizabeth is so beautiful in this movie and her heart is so open and profoundly intimate. You can literally see her falling in love with David - it looks so real! That is great acting when you are so immersed in the story you forget you are watching a movie!<br /><br />This movie has two love stories going at the same time and you will be very happy with both endings. The scenes are all cozy and the dreary weather makes it all so nice to have a fireplace and some warm coffee.<br /><br />Some of the dancing at the parties by the other actors was a bit silly, but when David and Elizabeth slow dance there is sure chemistry that sizzles. One of my favorite Tyler Hynes movies for sure. I think he's my favorite Canadian actor. You will laugh and even feel like crying a little. Great acting, the best I've ever seen!!!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

        "review_text": "If you want to feel more alive in your body with deep breathing and strengthening plus stretching you may enjoy the postures and dynamic movements in these yoga and Pilates inspired workouts. You may want to do one or more routines as time allows. I started with three workouts from level one. I did 2, 5 and 3 in that order and it was perfect. Level one seems for people who are familiar with yoga but want a slower pace and less strenuous exercises and postures.<br /><br />2 - 15 minutes - Chair Yoga is perfect for beginners who want to do the poses with the support of a chair. The stretches are for the upper and lower body. This felt so good.<br /><br />5 - 11 minutes - Movement Medicine stretches out the neck, shoulders and back. You will need a mat and strap to do this effectively. I especially loved the calming music.<br /><br />3 - 20 minutes - Yoga for Calm has serene relaxing music. Instead of a bolster I put two yoga blocks side by side with a blanket on top. That worked. When using blankets under my back I also needed a block to put my head on. On my back, I used two folded blankets in place of the bolster and a rolled up towel under my neck with two blocks under my knees. The restorative poses go by fast!<br /><br />You may want to do these next four all in one day too, I did it and it was great!<br /><br />1 - 24 minutes - Yoga for Strength has all the classic poses like mountain pose, downward facing dog, warrior and cobra. When the instructor went flat on her stomach I did cat/cow instead. This workout seemed very intermediate to be honest. There were no real modifications for beginners besides it was slower and you could use yoga blocks when needed.<br /><br />4 - 8 minutes - Core Blast - You will feel this all in your core and it is a short routine so you can put all your effort into just a few minutes. You do need to be on your knees for part of it but if you use a blanket that helps. Plus you need to be on your back and do an extended plank pose. I took breaks!<br /><br />6 - 5 minutes - Quick Fix for Back pain is not a relaxing workout to stretch out your back, it is more preventative so you strengthen your back. It uses a chair!<br /><br />7 - 6 minutes - Guided Meditation is a relaxing way to end your workouts. This is quieting and good if you are stressed out and just want to breathe deeply. There was no prayer or chanting so I'd say it was non religious meditation which I prefer.<br /><br />Level 2 is a whole other story! These routines are best if you are intermediate and know your way around a yoga posture.<br /><br />Total Body Yoga - 9 minutes - Selena Watkins is a very knowledgeable and fit instructor who has you standing tall and then rolling down to touch the floor. There is some ballet inspired work and it is generally flowing from one pose to another. You will recognize child's pose and reverse plank.<br /><br />Hips and Abs - 10 minutes - This has Pilates inspired moves or maybe some Pilates is inspired by yoga! You will recognize plank, side plank, child's pose, downward facing dog and half pigeon. You need a lot of ab strength to do this workout.<br /><br />Bends and Twists - 10 minutes - You need to be able to lay flat on your belly and do up dog which to me is more advanced. Bow appears and then you are flat on your back. Maybe in my 20s I could do some of the upside down yoga poses. Not anymore after 50!<br /><br />Strengthen and Stretch - 22 minutes - Downward dog turns into a balance challenge and there are lots of forward bends. Plank and cat/cow are familiar.<br /><br />Stretch and Tone - 11 minutes - Forward bends and intense stretches  are what you have to look forward to. You will be moving from cobra to child's pose.<br /><br />Then arrives Level 3 - This is for serious students of yoga who want to push themselves just that little bit further and do longer workouts that require balance, endurance and arm strength!<br /><br />1 - 30 minutes - Let It Go Yoga - This was almost more intermediate for the most part however. Plank pose, downward dog, up dog and low lunges are easier. It is the bridge pose that is difficult. Over 50 you may need a towel for your knees. There is lots of stretching and some balance postures.<br /><br />2 - 11 minutes - Anytime Yoga is cute with a home setting and an orange couch which has visual appeal. You will be doing plank, downward facing dog, upward facing dog and down dog split which is more challenging. You flow from one pose to another and it requires strength and flexibility.<br /><br />3 - 30 minutes - Power Flow is probably the most complex and toughest workout to do on all the DVDs. There are things I'd never seen done in a yoga workout before. The sun salutations require good arm strength and there are numerous forward bends if you enjoy that the best! The calming music is good because this workout is an endurance test. It is a very original sequence of moves designed for the most fit individual who wants a challenge. Definitely advanced!<br /><br />All of the instructors in these DVD workouts are super fit and trim. Amy Ippoliti had the most calming routines for Level 1. It was nice to see Christ Fraytag doing stretching. Rebecca Pacheco does everything perfectly and precisely - she is a joy to workout with. Selena Watkins is super strong and flexible. Tara Stiles does yoga in a high-rise with incredible views.<br /><br />Things you will want to have on hand when doing all these workouts include: a soft blanket, a chair, a sticky mat, yoga blocks, a yoga strap and an optional bolster. I do not have a bolster so substituted blocks and a blanket.<br /><br />So whether you are level 1, 2 or 3 there is something to enjoy. The workouts are short enough that you can do one or two or even more in a row. I do wish they'd put a meditation session on each DVD and not just the first so if you want a meditation session after a workout you don't have to put DVD 1 back in. But it is a minor thing. There is also no extended corpse poses to relax at the end of each workout. But you can just do it yourself as the workouts end.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

The instructor, Sarah Kusch, has a pleasing personality and uses humor to motivate you into action. The creative exercises are fun and invigorating, making this a total body toning program you want to keep doing day after day! You will be excited as each new day brings workouts that increase the challenge.<br /><br />After some of the longer 20-plus minute workouts you may feel like you want extra stretching. Some days only take 6 minutes, while others take 27 minutes.<br /><br />One thing perfectionists will notice is that sometimes the instructor talks about variations or gives helpful tips and you have to be disciplined enough to continue on doing what you are supposed to be doing. It gets easy after a while to follow along or modify for lower or higher intensities. I also suggest counting on each side to make sure you are doing an even number.<br /><br />Here is what the exercises are and how I felt about each workout or stretching routine:<br /><br />Fit and Firm Foundations (27:30 minutes) \u2013 This workout has lots of repetitions so you will really feel the burn. There is a warm up and a stretch at the end. You will really work your core. The second time I did this I really felt it. The exercises you will be doing include: lateral leg lifts, side-angle leg lifts, lateral and front arm raises, deadlifts, half-circle leg lifts, lat pull down with a hand towel, triceps pulse and chops with a towel.<br /><br />Standing Core Stability (6 minutes) \u2013 This is intensive core training focusing mostly on the abs. You will be lifting weight over your head.<br /><br />Full Body Recharge (6 minutes) \u2013 This is a total body stretching routine that you will wish was even longer. My one cat usually insists I do more stretches after I'm done. He wants me to do cat pose and loves it when I do this routine.<br /><br />Sweat and Strengthen (22:12 minutes) \u2013 This is cardio with low and high impact options. If you like HIIT you will enjoy doing intense exercises followed by exercises with weights. To be honest it keeps you invigorated and out of breath and I was doing the easiest variations to start. The exercises include speed skater, squat curl presses, triceps kickback, jumping jack with modifications, overhead reach, squat with forward punch, high knees, side-to-side squat, palms forward row, out-and-in taps, x arms, reach with tap back, biceps curls and squat reaches.<br /><br />Total Body Tone (23 minutes) \u2013 This is really tough the first time you do it if you are over 50! You have to be able to get down on the floor and lay on your back. Which sounds easy unless you realize that getting back up is going to be a big effort. My lower back felt these exercises. Fortunately you can do the exercises at your own pace. You don't need to get off the floor quickly at any point. Some of these exercises are inspired by Pilates so you know they work. The exercises include: squat with overhead raise, bent-over row, overhead triceps extension, alternating forward lunge, reverse fly, wide squat with biceps curl, chest fly, triceps burnout, side leg lift, forearm plank, back extension on stomach, pelvic tilt and tabletop leg drop.<br /><br />Tighten and Tone Basics (23:44 minutes) \u2013 It is best if you watch this one first before you try these exercises. There is a figure eight with weights, standing torso twists with weights, biceps curls, a sit-and-stand squat, reverse standing leg lifts, T fly, rainbow, triceps v and overhead chop. There is a cool down and stretching segment. I felt this weight training with cardio in my lower back but not badly. Felt this in my triceps too after doing it several times.<br /><br />Belly Burn (7:25 minutes) \u2013 The exercises start with cat pose and move to bird dog, side plank, leg drops, forearm plank, back extensions and scissors. Sarah Kusch does not give a lot of time to move from one posture to another. Obviously she is not over 50! So this was challenging.<br /><br />Tension Tamer (6:55 minutes) \u2013 After doing this the first time I decided to do Full Body Recharge in its place in the future. It actually increased my tension because of having to be on the floor. These stretches are good for the 20s, 30s and 40s. After 50 not so much. It is getting down on the floor that is the problem. There is a bridge hold, a Figure 4, hamstring stretch, child's pose. These look easy until you try to do them.<br /><br />Power Sculpt (22 minutes) \u2013 This starts with good mornings and then squats, overhead reaches side to side, biceps curls, leg lifts and overhead presses. There is a tricky curtsy lunge with a punch, a rotation row and a reverse lung with lateral raise. You move on to a standing side crunch, upper back butterfly swimmers and lateral lunch. A donkey kick then changes to pulses and a side lift. There are alternate leg circles which provide a challenge and a marching bridge which is advanced. It ends with plank. Whew! This is a bit intense on the knees when you are down on the ground so you may want a padded mat. I could not do the marching bridge or the leg circles. I may get to them eventually when feeling stronger. Instead I just did some stretches while I watched. The end of this workout was my least favorite part of the workouts.<br /><br />Fat Burning Fix ( 22:12) \u2013 This workout has a warm up and stretching at the end. It is cardio alternating with strength moves. It is for beginner, intermediate or advanced depending on which exercises you decide to follow. There is a diagonal slide, biceps lifts, triceps pulses, knee smashes, triceps kickbacks, lateral raises (a coordination challenge), a unique Genie Fly, step back lunge, lateral shuffles, forward lunge with a chip, weighted star (creative balancing with weight), jumping jack, W press out and high knees. Overall very challenging and I needed to drink a lot of water. Out of all the workouts in this program, this was the most intense.<br /><br />To be honest some days were harder than others. I loved the 6 minute days because they gave me a rest in between the more challenging workouts. Some days I almost didn't get in a workout but I swapped a few days moving the 6 minute workout to the 20 minute workout day then did the 20 minute workout the next day and so it all worked out. Staying on a program is interesting. I only made one change in the workout that I didn't like  - so I just did another stretching workout on that day. I skipped working out for a few days after day 22 because I fell in my yard \u2013 OK was walking back from the mailbox and my shoe caught on the cement sidewalk. So felt a bit sore and took a day off and then another when my back hurt. I also did Power Sculpt on day 31 because I was impatient to get to that workout. The instructions say you can swap workouts around and I find that does work in some cases.<br /><br />What did I notice after all these workouts?<br /><br />Increased muscular strength in my daily tasks. Suddenly picking up a case of 35 water bottles was not as difficult. Folding laundry was a breeze.<br /><br />Increased balance \u2013 I could turn quickly without feeling like I was going to fall over. Walking around the house I feel a bit like a race driver with a new vehicle!<br /><br />Increased Body Awareness \u2013 Everything felt smooth and fluid when moving. I felt more at home in my body and could sense greater strength and mobility.<br /><br />Increased Energy \u2013 Like a lot! I'm even sleeping less. I feel happier and more in control of my life.<br /><br />So I'd say this has definite advantages. This comes with a little booklet so you can keep track of everything. I did the beginner workout plan and wrote down the date and checked off the workouts as I did them. That kept me very organized. I have made it up to day 31 and there are 56 days!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

She has a slim, toned and strong body and can do exercises with advanced precision. It is a joy to watch her body move through all the poses and stretches and I especially loved how her makeup was done. Her voice and chatty style lulled me into a relaxed state almost like hypnosis. I found her instructions calming and soothing.<br /><br />Some of the exercises are done in a chair like the face and neck exercises. You will do shoulder shrugs and stretch the neck side to side. Then you will do eye exercises and facial exercises that help relax your jaw. You may find these exercises and stretches especially healing if you work on a computer all day or if you tend to clench your jaw from stress.<br /><br />Other exercises are done on the floor with a yoga mat. The hip exercises and stretches have some easy and advanced poses that are inspired by Pilates. The leg stretches can be modified with yoga blocks and include active stretching that test endurance and strength. You will move quickly from one pose to another.<br /><br />For the Feet and Calves you will need a chair and two yoga blocks. If you've never exercised your feet before like this you may want to take the rest of the day off or try the chest openers next.<br /><br />The Chest stretching was actually one of my favorite parts of this DVD. You will feel your core being strengthened too. You will need a strap - a yoga one works great.<br /><br />To do some of these stretches you will need to be able to get down onto the floor and back up again. Not so easy for me now that I'm over 50 but I pushed through and did it anyways. So I would say this DVD also tests your resilience and endurance not to mention patience and flexibility. I could have easily done all these exercises with no problem in my 20s, 30s and 40s! So if you do a lot of yoga and Pilates you may find these exercises very relaxing and invigorating.<br /><br />There is a bar on the left side of the screen to clue you in to how long you still have until completion of each section. It is not distracting once you get used to it and seems helpful.<br /><br />Some of the props you will need include 2 yoga blocks, a strap, a clean dry washcloth, a rubber band and a small ball for the foot exercises. I managed without the small ball but definitely used the strap and found a rubber band in my drawer that worked. The washcloth is used for the jaw stretches but nowhere else.<br /><br />Some of my other favorite DVDs for Stretching and Strengthening include:<br /><br />Simply Stretch by Jessica Smith<br />Yoga for Inflexible People<br />Pilates on the Go by Maria Leone<br />Face Aerobics<br />Karen Voight Full Body Stretch<br />Stretch and Strength by Anne Pringle Burnell (Especially geared for those over 50!)<br /><br />I think it is a worthy goal to collect as many of these excellent DVDs as you can because stretching DVDs are what you need to feel good and flexible as you age. This Easy Healing Stretches DVD has five sections that you can do over a period of days to increase your whole body's strength and tone. Enjoy!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

How pathetic and gross. Amazon is tanking. I hope Elon takes over this garbage and fixes what they broke<br /><br />The major cons are that half the time when I first get into the car I can see it picked up on my Bluetooth. Great. However it will randomly disconnect causing me to have to unplug it from the lighter port and pop it back in. I jave to do this 10 out of 10 times. .<br />Next be weary. Do not leave it plugged in. It will drain your battery in your car if you do. Always unplug it when you get out of your car...or have a potential dead battery come morning. No good<br />Lastly since the app update it won't play songs you ask it to.

        "story": "As she sat alone in her dimly lit study, surrounded by stacks of worn paperbacks and scribbled notes, Emma devoured the latest romantic suspense novel, its themes of repressed memories and redemption resonating deeply within her. The words blurred together on the page as she guessed the identity of the antagonist early on, yet she couldn't help but continue reading, captivated by the author's skillful weaving of tension and romance, and finding solace in the protagonist's journey towards healing and love - a bittersweet reminder of her own struggles to confront the past, and the comforting notion that even in darkness, there was always hope for a brighter tomorrow.",
        "motivation_category": "safety",
        "analysis": "This story is logically consistent because Emma, as a romantic suspense writer, is naturally drawn to stories that explore complex human emotions, and her ability to guess the antagonist suggests an analytical mind engaged in the narrative. Her motivation to escape from traumatic memories and find comfort and security places the story firmly in the 'safety' category, as she seeks solace and reassurance through the story, using it as a means to momentarily forget her own troubles and find a sense of resolution, which aligns with the fundamental human need for safety and security."

The Nighthawk X6 AC3200 has excellent signal strength I have great coverage throughout my house 1500sqf and yard out 50ft from the house. I even have connectivity in my shed/workshop that I never had with the old setup. We have 3 tv's that stream, multiple wifi devices, wireless security cams etc and our cell phones use wifi calling as we have no cell service in the house and it all works great. I've had it installed for a few months now with no hiccups it just works. The Nighthawk X6 AC3200 is a great device even though its a refurbish unit you wouldn't know it. I would purchase again if you're looking for a decent router this is a good choice.<br /><br />Update: 11/05/2022<br />I have been a longtime Netgear customer and owned and worked with many of them but I have lost faith recently.  The latest firmware updated and caused network disconnects and stability issues lost/dropped connections and many network errors!  The hardware is great its Netgear firmware/software that causes the router to fail and become unusable dropping connections , failed dns etc. making the router useless.  Because the router was refurbished the warranty was up or I would have returned to Netgear and gone with a different vendor. Eventually after many hours on Netgear support forums trying several solutions not liking the end result I finally gave up and went with an alternate solution DD-WRT.  I finally got the router setup with the latest DD-WRT firmware and got a stable network back. I expected some quirks going with an open source firmware and very little support so it was a trial and error for a period, I dont recommend using free opensource firmware if your not familiar with it.  Avoid buying Netgear or any other until you've done your research, check the vendor support forums for known issues and solutions or you could end up with a paperweight. Its a shame Netgear has so many known issues with the firmware of many devices that I have moved away from being that loyal customer but like many vendors they have gone through there share of changes and its now time to move own.",

        "review_text": "Okay I finally got the Ps5, I was at a big box store, casually walking down the isle when I looked down and noticed there was a brand new Ps5 sitting on the shelf! There was a golden halo around the Ps5 (in my mind lol)!<br /><br />I grabbed the Ps5 and went directly to checkout, almost feeling like the store had made a mistake because I hadn't seen one in a store since it was released almost 2 years ago!<br />Upon getting home and connecting everything and migrating all my accounts I fired up the Ps5 and went to an open world game and to my surprise all the game chat comes out of the controller and there was no way to revert this back to the TV. This is a huge flaw for my new Ps5 and I really couldn't believe this was how Sony had decided to set this up.<br />My search began on how to fix this issue, I came across a forum where people were speaking their displeasure with this issue. They found a work around and it's not the best but it works! Read below!<br /><br />Find an old pair of wired headphones and cut off the 3.5mm male input jack and plug it into the controller and in theory the voice chat should convert to your TV. I gave it a try and it WORKED! Not only did it work but I was still able to use the controller as my mic by toggling the mute button on the controller. I must admit I hate this 3.5mm jack sticking out of my controller but it works so until they fix this issue it is what it is.<br /><br />Okay on to the review of this charger!<br /><br />After doing the above mentioned work around for the chat I now have a 3.5mm jack sticking out of my controller and most Ps5 chargers charge the controller upright and this would mean I'd have to pull my 3.5mm jack every time I'd want to charge my controller. This simply wasn't going to work. My search had begun for a charger that would charge my controllers upside down and I came across this charger.<br />The charger matches my Ps5 white color and looks great above it. I love that it shows red while the controller is charging and turns green once it's done. The rapid charge is great and charges my controller extremely fast. Best of all it charges the controller upside down so I do not need to take out my 3.5mm male jack every charge. Insert the USB C male dongel into the controller and it slips right into the charger port.<br /><br />For the price and ease of use you can't go wrong with this charger. Extremely happy with my purchase. Will buy again if needed.",
